Mike Michaud (D-Maine), who is running for governor of Maine in 2014, announced Monday that he is gay. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t In an op-ed article published in two Maine newspapers, Michaud said decided to come out publicly after his opponents launched a \u201cwhisper campaign\u201d about his sexuality. \u201cThey want people to question whether I am gay,\u201d Michaud wrote in the article, published by the Bangor Daily News and Portland Press Herald. \u201cAllow me to save them the trouble with a simple, honest answer: \u2018Yes, I am. But why should it matter?\u2019 \u201d Michaud faces Gov. Paul Le\u00adPage (R) and independent candidate Eliot Cutler in the governor\u2019s race. LePage is considered among the most vulnerable governors in the country. Michaud becomes the seventh openly gay member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the eighth in either chamber of Congress. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) became the first openly gay senator after she won her seat last year. If elected, Michaud would be the first openly gay person to win a governor\u2019s race. Jim McGreevey (D) of New Jersey became the first openly gay governor in 2004, but he didn\u2019t come out until he was in office. Michaud wrote in the article that he doesn\u2019t consider his sexual orientation to be a big deal but added that he decided to make it public in order to show that he\u2019s not ashamed. \u201cAnd if seeing someone from my background, in my position, openly acknowledge the fact that he\u2019s gay makes it a little bit easier for future generations to live their lives openly and without fear, all the better,\u201d he wrote.

The 61 to 30 margin virtually guarantees its passage this week.  It has been more than 17 years since the Senate voted on the issue, and Monday\u2019s vote was a vivid illustration of how new political currents have forced lawmakers from both parties to catch up with an electorate that is increasingly supportive of gay rights. Fourteen states have legalized same-sex marriage, and a majority of Americans believe gay couples should have the right to wed. Advocates still face long odds in getting the legislation to President Obama\u2019s desk. House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio), who leads a GOP caucus dominated by social conservatives, reiterated his opposition to the measure Monday and said he would not bring it to the House floor regardless of its fate in the Senate. But even in the face of obstacles, advocates say the debate has changed radically in their favor. They note that most opponents, including Boehner, have focused their concerns on allegations that the legislation would benefit trial lawyers and have shied away from the morality and family-values questions that once dominated the issue.\n \u201cThere\u2019s been a softer tone, and there\u2019s been a recognition that anti-gay politics that may have worked in 2000 and in 2004 don\u2019t work anymore,\u201d said Jeff Cook-McCormac, senior adviser to the American Unity Fund, a pro-gay-rights group funded by Republican mega-donors. \n\n The roll call on the vote produced a rare moment of Senate drama, as a trio of prominent Republicans \u2014 Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) \u2014 holed up in the GOP cloakroom off the floor deciding at the last minute whether to back the legislation. Democrats needed those GOP votes to clear the 60-vote hurdle because a couple of supporters were absent. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the legislation\u2019s main sponsor, negotiated with the GOP holdouts over the bill\u2019s final details, and almost 40 minutes after the roll call began, the three Republicans voted for the measure. A decade ago, the political calculation was far different. The brain trust of President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection team encouraged a series of state ballot initiatives banning same-sex marriage as a way to draw more conservatives to the polls. In 2006, running into the head winds of a midterm election, Senate Republicans pushed legislation that would have imposed a federal ban on same-sex marriage \u2014 in large part because GOP advisers considered it a winning political maneuver , even as it fell well short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Even when Democrats held 60 Senate seats in 2009, the majority did not advance ENDA, partly out of fear that some incumbents in conservative-leaning states would not be able to support the measure because of a potential political backlash.   Those attitudes have changed in the past three years, beginning with the vote in December 2010 to end the military\u2019s ban on service by openly gay members. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Supporters of the legislation noted that 21 states and the District of Columbia have laws that prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, and almost 10 more have had some protections through executive orders by governors. \n On Monday, after seven years in the minority, Senate Republicans provided the key margin to advance the gay rights bill, along with a handful of Democrats from deep red states who a few years ago might have feared the political fallout from supporting the legislation. In the hours leading up to the vote, no Republicans went to the floor to publicly oppose the measure. The only Republicans to speak were those in favor of the legislation, including Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.), who used his first Senate floor speech since having a stroke two years ago to support the bill. The other Republicans who supported the key procedural vote were Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Dean Heller (Nevada) and Orrin G. Hatch (Utah). The political push has been similar to the effort to end the \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy in the military, focusing on appealing to conservative values of wanting to help capable people join the workforce. \u201cWe\u2019re the party that focuses on the people\u2019s ability to do the job,\u201d said former senator Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), whom the American Unity Fund hired to lobby on behalf of the antidiscrimination measure. A small but vocal bloc of conservative groups has been trying to rally opposition to the legislation, including the Family Research Council and Heritage Action for America . \u201cIt would not protect equality under the law, but create special privileges that are enforceable against private actors,\u201d Ryan Anderson of Heritage wrote last week . Those groups, however, do not have the financial resources that the other side has, particularly American Unity, which has been seeded with donations from Paul Singer, a billionaire chief executive of a hedge fund. Another backer of the group is former Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman, who was Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign manager. Now a Wall Street executive, Mehlman announced in 2010 that he is gay. The coordination between these Republicans and liberal gay rights groups would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Now, they are working hand in hand. On Friday morning, Democratic press secretaries received a briefing on the non-discrimination legislation that was led by the Human Rights Campaign, a well-funded group supporting gay rights. The Democratic group received a briefing on polling that was delivered by Target Point Consulting, a GOP polling firm that once advised Mitt Romney. Other GOP strategists have joined the effort, in part because of their own experience with gay friends or relatives, and in part because many Republicans believe that their political survival in the long run depends on softening the party\u2019s long-standing opposition to gay rights. Target Point\u2019s polling data showed that more than 80\u00a0percent of voters think that discrimination against gay workers is already illegal. When asked whether they support a federal law that \u201cprotects gay and transgender people from employment discrimination,\u201d 56\u00a0percent of Republicans said yes, according to the firm\u2019s polling. That has been the message that Coleman and former congressman Thomas M. Reynolds (R-N.Y.), who is also lobbying for American Unity, have been pushing to GOP lawmakers. They have cautioned that this vote does not mean a lawmaker supports same-sex marriage, but is instead a vote to help the economy. \u201cIt should be an easy vote for Republicans,\u201d said Coleman, who remains opposed to same-sex marriage. Even on the issue, attitudes are shifting quickly. In deep-red South Carolina, 52\u00a0percent of voters still oppose same-sex , but that number is down from 78\u00a0percent in 2006, when the state\u2019s voters easily approved a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. In the House, 193 lawmakers have signed on as co-sponsors of the non-discrimination act, including six Republicans.", "topics": ["politics"], "author": "Paul Kane", "wordCount": 1161}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Federal Diary: New postal union leader promises more aggressive defense of \u2018public postal service\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/334cb89c/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Cfederal0Igovernment0Cnew0Epostal0Eunion0Eleader0Epromises0Emore0Eaggressive0Edefense0Eof0Epublic0Epostal0Eservice0C20A130C110C0A40Cb5a5c32e0E45880E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ipolitics/story01.htm", "text": "At some point soon, someone might need to remind Mark Dimondstein that he asked for this. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Taking over as president of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) during a time when the U.S. Postal Service is a financial wreck doesn\u2019t sound like fun. He\u2019ll be installed as president of the nation\u2019s largest postal union, with almost 200,000 members, on Nov. 12 after winning an upset election last month. But the 30-year veteran of the Postal Service from Greensboro, N.C., didn\u2019t unseat incumbent Cliff Guffey to have a good time. Dimondstein did it to protect union members from what he sees as the creeping privatization of postal services and to give the workers a union leadership that more aggressively defends their interests as management tries to dig out of an ever-sinking financial hole. Over the past two years, USPS has lost $20 billion and has missed $16.7 billion in payments to the Treasury for future retiree health benefits. USPS \u201cis in the midst of a financial disaster,\u201d says an agency news release . \u201cThe Postal Service as it exists today is financially unsustainable,\u201d Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe told a Senate committee in September. With this bleak backdrop, Dimondstein\u2019s victory, with about 55 percent of the vote , indicates the emergence of a more militant union. \u201cThe APWU membership has spoken decisively,\u201d he said , \u201cfor a new direction in our union as we face the challenges of protecting our jobs, our retirement and our public postal service from the postal privatizers on Wall Street, in Congress and even in postal headquarters.\u201d In a Monday interview with the Federal Diary, Dimondstein discussed where he wants to take the union and the financial troubles of the agency where his members work. This is an edited transcript of that conversation. \n\n What is this new direction where you want to take APWU? \n\n The new direction is where the American Postal Workers Union focuses its fight to save the United States post office. It should be there for generations to come. It should be vibrant. We thought the current administration was solely focused on lobbying Congress. We believe Congress moves best when the people move to make demands on Congress. Also the new direction has to do with the relationship with postal management. We think postal management is intent on privatizing the Postal Service, which would be the worst thing that could happen to the Postal Service. \n\n Let me ask about this privatization notion. That is not something postal management has proposed to Congress. \n\n Management hasn\u2019t proposed it directly to Congress, but everything they are doing is lining the Postal Service up for privatization. Management has proposed five-day delivery. If you only deliver five days, then that might be four days, then somebody else on the private side starts delivering one day, two days and three days and so on. If the mail can\u2019t be processed and delivered in a timely manner, then someone else is going to do that, people are going to start looking elsewhere. If post offices are closed or their hours are cut back, then people are going to be forced to go to a private pharmacy or an Office Depot type of store or a Wal-Mart to buy their postal products. All of that is heading toward privatization. \n\n How will the union\u2019s relationship with management change under your direction? \n\n We\u2019ll have to see. We\u2019re going to have lines in the sand that we\u2019re not willing to cross. We would expect from management that they stop these [postal] plant closings. [Donahoe has reported to Congress about \u201cthe accelerated consolidation\u201d of postal processing facilities and the \u201creduction in hours at 13,000 Post Offices, in conjunction with the expansion of alternate retail access.\u201d] We\u2019re not afraid to march, we\u2019re not afraid to sit in if we got to and we think we need to work with all the other postal unions. While we\u2019re not calling today for the resignation of the PMG [postmaster general], if the postmaster general doesn\u2019t respond to the message our union sent, then we\u2019ll also have to deal with that question. \n\n Are there any issues that you would advance that have not been advanced by APWU so far? \n\n I think we need much more solidarity amongst the postal unions in terms of our common fight in a time of crisis. I think we have to work with the labor movement, the AFL-CIO in a much stronger way. I think we have to work with the people of this country and their organizations in a much stronger way.\n I call it the grand alliance. When we take office on Nov. 12, we\u2019re going to immediately set out to build a grand alliance with the people of this country, organizations that represent seniors, civil rights organizations, veterans organizations, business organizations, organizations that represent folks in small towns to build an alliance in this country to defend our national treasure. People in this country still really support the post office. It\u2019s part of our community. It\u2019s part of our neighborhoods. We think given the opportunity that people will step up and defend their right to a public postal service. \n Twitter: @JoeDavidsonWP \n \n \n Previous columns by Joe Davidson are available at wapo.st/JoeDavidson .", "topics": ["politics"], "author": "Joe Davidson", "wordCount": 860}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In the Loop: Hey, everyone needs a golfing break", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/334cb89a/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Chey0Eeveryone0Eneeds0Ea0Egolfing0Ebreak0C20A130C110C0A40C3fcb41420E4560A0E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ipolitics/story01.htm", "text": "If you\u2019d like to play golf on government time, \n Steven Calvery \n , who runs the Pentagon\u2019s police force, could be the boss for you. Then again, if fetching lunch and coffee for your supervisor every day doesn\u2019t appeal, you may want to work elsewhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Calvery, the director of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, which safeguards the building and 100 other military sites around Washington, has been dinged by the Defense Department inspector general for \u201cmisusing\u201d his position and underlings, our colleague Craig Whitlock reports. In a 40-page report released Monday, the inspector general also said Calvery improperly allowed an unnamed relative to blast away at the Pentagon Force Protection Agency firing range, using a PFPA weapon and ammunition. Tips and advice were provided, gratis, by two PFPA firearms instructors. The relative was applying for a job with another law enforcement agency and apparently needed some practice, the report found. The inspector general began its misconduct investigation into Calvery after it received a couple of anonymous complaints in March 2011, as well as a letter from an unidentified U.S. senator. The inspector general labored on the inquiry for nearly two years, wrapping things up on Feb. 20, but then kept the findings quiet. On April 2, The Washington Post filed a request for the Calvery investigation under the Freedom of Information Act. On Monday, seven months later, the inspector general finally coughed up the report. Investigators found that Calvery wanted to boost the \u201cesprit de corps\u201d of the 1,300 folks who worked for him. So in 2009 and 2010, he decreed that anyone who wanted to play in the PFPA\u2019s annual golf tournament would receive four hours\u2019 paid administrative leave. Demand, it seems, was pretty high. The report notes that \u201cthe number of participants was regulated by the capacity of the golf course.\u201d An estimated 100 to 150 lucky duffers got to spend half the workday at play. The fun came to an end the next year when a party pooper in the PFPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel \u201cadvised that it was not a good idea to authorize administrative leave\u201d to play golf. According to the report, Calvery later told investigators that he still thought he had the authority to let folks in the office play on taxpayers\u2019 time but decided to \u201cerr on the side of caution\u201d and make people take vacation time instead starting in 2011. When Calvery\u2019s staffers weren\u2019t on the golf course, however, life could sometimes be unpleasant. Five witnesses told the inspector general that Calvery\u2019s staffers brought him lunch and coffee every day, and that some of them weren\u2019t too happy about it. One unidentified witness testified that Calvery would often pre-order his lunch from the Air Force or Navy mess at the Pentagon and then his staffers would have to pick it up (no explanation for why Calvery avoided Army chow). The boss always paid for his meals and lattes, but the inspector general chided him for misusing his subordinates to cater to him. Calvery told investigators that he never coerced anyone into fetching his lunch, adding: \u201cI would hope if they felt uncomfortable doing it, they would tell me. And if they did feel uncomfortable, then that would be okay. You know, they wouldn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d   The inspector general urged the Office of the Secretary of Defense to take \u201cappropriate action\u201d against Calvery. Lt. Col. Tom Crosson , a Pentagon spokesman, said Calvery was subjected to \u201cappropriate administrative action\u201d as a result of the probe, but he declined to elaborate, citing privacy restrictions. Calvery did not respond to a request for comment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n A career repeats itself \n \u201cYou Can\u2019t Go Home Again,\u201d the title of the Thomas Wolfe novel, obviously doesn\u2019t apply to Bill Woodward (no relation to Bob ). He\u2019s now moving back to Foggy Bottom \u2014 to much the same job he had some two decades ago working for a newly installed ambassador to the United Nations named Madeleine Albright . He kept that portfolio as well as a policy advisory role when Albright moved to the seventh floor. He went on to help her write her five best-selling books. Now, the new U.N. ambassador, Samantha Power , has brought the talented wordsmith on as a speechwriter and adviser. He\u2019ll probably be working not far from the office he used to have. Before his stint with Albright, Woodward worked for then-Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and then-Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.) and on several presidential campaigns. \n At least it wasn\u2019t diesel \n The Energy Department has a gas problem. At two of the department\u2019s outposts, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Bonneville Power Administration, a large fleet of supposedly environmentally friendly flex-fuel cars were routinely filled with regular old gasoline (read: not so green), a recent inspector general\u2019s report found. The report dinged the managers of the cars, noting that they had \u201cnot always managed their substantial vehicle fleets in a cost-effective or efficient manner, nor did they take all prudent steps to advance the use of alternative fuels.\u201d And the flex-fuel cars cost an extra $700,000 over what the department would have spent on traditional gas guzzlers. In some cases, the report notes, it was tough to find the ethanol to power them. So at one point, the folks at Los Alamos used a tanker truck to bring ethanol fuel to 65 vehicles, which cost $66,000. \u201cWe appreciate the IG\u2019s recommendations, and we are working aggressively to implement a plan that addresses their findings,\u201d an Energy Department spokesman tells us. \n\n \n Apparently, it isn\u2019t easy \u2014 or cheap \u2014 being green. \n\n With Emily Heil \n\n \n The blog: washingtonpost.com/ intheloop .

A pair of conservative nonprofit groups at the heart of the effort were fined a record $1\u00a0million after a year-long state investigation, while two political committees were ordered to repay the state for $15\u00a0million in donations they received. \u201cIt is clear that people are willing to use circuitous routes to avoid telling the voters who\u2019s behind campaigns,\u201d said Ann Ravel, a new Democratic appointee to the Federal Election Commission who helped oversee the California inquiry as a state official. Several of the advocacy groups at the center of the California case \u2014 Americans for Job Security, Americans for Responsible Leadership and American Future Fund \u2014 have played significant roles in national elections, reporting more than $68\u00a0million in campaign-related expenditures during the past two elections, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Because they are set up as nonprofit organizations rather than political committees, the groups are not required to disclose their financial supporters to the FEC. The details of the California scheme, revealed in interviews and a cache of investigative documents, show how political operatives casually shuffle around massive sums with little accountability. At one point, a consultant involved in the project sent a text message to another requesting $11\u00a0million. The case also spotlights the extreme measures that operatives took to skirt disclosure regulations, passing along funds through a daisy chain of organizations, often without knowing which groups would get the cash or whether the money would end up where it was intended. The episode was set in motion by Tony Russo, a Republican political strategist in Sacramento, who sought to spend $25\u00a0million on issue ads last fall on two state ballot initiative campaigns without reporting who gave the money. He turned for help to Sean Noble, a GOP operative plugged into a national network of conservative advocacy groups. The two agreed to a money swap that Russo hoped would allow his group to avoid disclosure requirements. \u201cI said, \u2018Sean, you know, I have a big hiccup in California,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Russo later recounted for state investigators. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Can we support some of your national efforts and, in turn, do you have groups that can help us in California?\u2019 That was pretty much as simple as it was.\u201d But the plan was far from simple, or effective. In the end, about $10\u00a0million of the nearly $25\u00a0million that Russo\u2019s group transferred to Noble\u2019s operation never made it back to California. Outmatched by labor unions and other supporters of Gov. Jerry Brown (D), Russo and his allies lost both initiative campaigns.   Many of the original donors whose identities they sought to protect were also outed as a result of the investigation. The names can be deciphered from a partially redacted list of 150 donors that Russo\u2019s lawyers provided to the California attorney general\u2019s office as part of the inquiry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The partially visible list reveals members of the Fisher family, who founded clothing retailer the Gap and gave more than $9\u00a0million; San Francisco investor Charles Schwab, who gave more than $6\u00a0million; and Las Vegas casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson, who with his wife contributed $500,000. One particularly surprising contributor was real-estate magnate and philanthropist Eli Broad, a longtime supporter of Democrats , who gave $500,000 to the effort. All the donors declined to comment or confirm their role. \n The interstate swap \n Dubbed the \u201cCalifornia Comeback\u201d by organizers, the initiative campaign was inspired by the success of conservative advocacy groups in Wisconsin, which in 2011 rallied around Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s push to roll back union rights . That effort was driven in part by groups with ties to billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, and major donors began telling Russo that a similar effort was needed in the Golden State. \u201cIt started with just a kernel of, \u2018Hey, we should be trying to figure out how we create a voice in California,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Russo told investigators. \u201cAnd the Koch model was the model that they were encouraging.\u201d Russo, who works closely with the business community, developed the plan with Jeff Miller, a fundraiser who once headed the finance operations for the state Republican Party and former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Their goal was to raise at least $50\u00a0million to fight Proposition 30, a temporary tax-hike measure Brown was pushing, and support Proposition 32, which would bar unions and corporations from using payroll deductions to raise money for political campaigns. Half of the money would be dedicated to issue ads, which do not require donor disclosure. Russo and Miller, who ended up bringing in $74\u00a0million, were not charged and cooperated with investigators after receiving criminal immunity. They declined to comment for this article.\n \nThe two men told prosecutors that they enlisted the help of Stephen DeMaura, president of Americans for Job Security (AJS ), a nonprofit group registered in Virginia, who was willing to run the issue ads and take on California\u2019s powerful unions. Noble, who Russo said he met through a Koch donor, also pitched in, hiring pollster Frank Luntz to conduct focus groups for the campaign and paying veteran GOP admaker Larry McCarthy to cut possible TV spots. Noble did not respond to requests for comment. By the fall of 2012, Russo and Miller had about $25\u00a0million available for the issue ad campaign. But the money had come in later than they had hoped, and DeMaura worried that running ads could trigger disclosure requirements that kick in close to Election Day, the Sacramento consultants recalled. \n\n But then a lawyer advising the team raised the idea of swapping funds with other organizations as a way of getting the money back in the state without running afoul of disclosure rules. In California, nonprofit groups that make political donations must disclose any contributions made for that purpose, a requirement they hoped to sidestep if another group gave funds that were not raised for the campaign.   Russo turned to Noble, hoping Noble could arrange a money swap through his group, the Center to Protect Patient Rights (CPPR), a Phoenix-based nonprofit with ties to the Kochs . \u201cThe same money couldn\u2019t come back\u201d into California, Russo explained to investigators. \u201cKoch, our understanding was, had a pretty significant network of groups. So that\u2019s why we went to Sean.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t At the time, Noble was working as a consultant to Koch Industries, a position he held through 2012. But Koch spokesman Robert Tappan said in a statement that the Kochs \u201chad no involvement whatsoever, financial or otherwise, neither directly nor indirectly, on anything to do with Prop. 30 or Prop. 32.\u201d  Tappan said the Kochs were not aware that Noble had agreed to help Russo move money into California. \u201cWhatever Sean Noble did with regard to those issues did not involve us,\u201d he said. \n \u2018A fiasco in our world\u2019 \n \n\n The money swap played out over five weeks in the fall. DeMaura transferred $24.55\u00a0million from his group in Virginia to Noble\u2019s organization. The funds were accompanied with letters noting that the funds\u2019 use was \u201cat the sole discretion of your organization.\u201d Noble then dispersed similar amounts to two other nonprofit groups: the American Future Fund in Des Moines and Americans for Responsible Leadership in Phoenix. In California, Joel Fox, the president of the Small Business Action Committee, a political committee running ads about the two ballot initiatives, heard from an excited Russo. \u201cHe said he was working on a big donation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Fox said in an interview. Fox said his group did not know the money would be coming from Americans for Responsible Leadership until a few days before a wire transfer for $11\u00a0million arrived Oct. 15. The committee received assurances from a lawyer working with Noble that it was legitimate, according to Russo. But the large sum from an obscure, out-of-state group caught the attention of Common Cause, an organization that advocates for more transparency in campaign finance. It filed a complaint Oct. 19 with the state\u2019s Fair Political Practices Commission, and Brown used the case to decry \u201cmoney laundering\u201d by \u201cshadowy forces\u201d working against him. As the commission pressed the Arizona group to reveal its donors, Noble told Russo in late October that he couldn\u2019t deliver the final $10\u00a0million needed in California, and he warned that he would point to AJS if investigators sought to trace the source of the funds. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t tolerate an audit of CPPR,\u201d Russo recalled Noble telling him. Two days before the Nov. 6 election, the California Supreme Court ordered Americans for Responsible Leadership to reveal the source of its contribution. It named Noble\u2019s group, which in turned pointed the finger at AJS in Virginia. The Sacramento consultants were furious. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a fiasco in our world,\u201d Miller told investigators. Russo said he was \u201cshocked,\u201d saying he believed AJS funds had been diverted elsewhere in Noble\u2019s network. After a year-long investigation, the commission and the attorney general\u2019s office absolved the Virginia nonprofit of wrongdoing but fined Noble\u2019s organization and Americans for Responsible Leadership a combined $1\u00a0million, a record in the state. It also ordered the two state political committees that spent the funds routed through CPPR to pay the state $15 million. \nFox was stunned. \u201cWe cooperated with this inquiry from the beginning and were told by the attorney general\u2019s office we were clean,\u201d he said. Besides, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t have $11\u00a0million sitting around.\u201d Kirk Adams, president of Americans for Responsible Leadership, said in a statement that the group was pleased the matter was resolved but declined to comment on the state\u2019s findings regarding other groups. As for AJS, DeMaura said that it \u201cconsistently worked within the law\u201d and added that the controversy had not hurt its fundraising. \u201cOur membership continues to grow,\u201d he said in a statement. One lingering mystery is the $10\u00a0million that never made it to California after Russo\u2019s team transferred it to Noble\u2019s operation. Toward the end of Russo\u2019s interview with investigators, a state prosecutor asked whether he felt guilty that money he got from donors did not go where it was intended. \u201cWell, I mean, I felt bad, but, at the same time, you do your best with the facts that you have at the time,\u201d Russo replied, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to break any laws.\u201d", "topics": ["politics"], "author": "Matea Gold and Tom Hamburger", "wordCount": 1720}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Obama on health care: \u2018I\u2019ve got one more campaign in me To make sure this law works.\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/334c8f8a/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Celection0E20A120Cpost0Cobama0Eon0Ehealth0Ecare0Eive0Egot0Eone0Emore0Ecampaign0Ein0Eme0Eto0Emake0Esure0Ethis0Elaw0Eworks0C20A130C110C0A40C467ecddc0E45b10E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ipolitics/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["politics"], "author": "David Nakamura", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Charlie Crist running for Florida governor \u2014 with Democrats\u2019 blessing", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/334c8f2a/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Ccharlie0Ecrist0Erunning0Efor0Eflorida0Egovernor0E0Ewith0Edemocrats0Eblessing0C20A130C110C0A40C464c0Aaf60E45880E11e30Ebf0Ac0Ecebf37c6f4840Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ipolitics/story01.htm", "text": "As Florida\u2019s charismatic Republican governor, Charlie Crist was a national star in his party. He declared Ronald Reagan his role model. He came close to becoming John McCain\u2019s vice presidential running mate in 2008. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But on Monday, less than three years removed from his tenure as Florida\u2019s GOP governor and a year after becoming a Democrat, Crist presented himself to voters once again \u2014 in a new light. \n\n Now, in a twist of political fate, a man once ridiculed by Democrats as lacking substance and conviction has emerged as their party\u2019s presumptive standard-bearer in the 2014 gubernatorial contest. If Crist becomes the nominee, the race would take on an unusual character, pitting Florida\u2019s two most recent Republican governors against each other in what surely would be a bitter, expensive and nationally watched competition. At stake is which party controls the levers of power in the country\u2019s most populous swing state ahead of the 2016 presidential race. Some of Florida\u2019s most prominent Democrats stood with Crist for his formal campaign announcement Monday morning in his home town of St. Petersburg, embracing him as their best hope for ousting Republican Gov. Rick Scott next year. Scott backers quickly began an ad campaign citing past Democratic criticism of Crist as an opportunistic shape-shifter. Yet Crist \nintends to make a case to voters disgusted by partisan warfare in Washington and Tallahassee that his flexibility is a plus. \u201cThe far-right wing seems to want to make much of my party affiliation,\u201d he told cheering supporters and family members, including his Republican parents. \u201cThat is precisely what\u2019s wrong with politics today.\u201d To those who have watched him closely since his humiliating loss in the 2010 U.S. Senate race to Marco Rubio, Crist\u2019s reemergence as a Democrat is hardly surprising. When polls that year showed him likely to lose the Republican nomination to Rubio, largely because of conservative anger about Crist\u2019s support for President Obama\u2019s economic stimulus program, Crist renounced his party affiliation and ran as an independent. He became a Democrat last year and campaigned for Obama\u2019s reelection , speaking at the party\u2019s national convention in Charlotte and using that opportunity to court key players in the president\u2019s fundraising and activist networks. The Obama machinery was evident immediately on Monday. The president\u2019s 2008 Florida director, Steven Schale, is serving as an adviser, while the campaign has hired Obama media guru Jim Margolis. Several prominent state Democrats appeared with Crist onstage, including longtime former state attorney general Bob Butterworth and former state House Democratic leader Dan Gelber. The scene underscored how much Florida Democrats want to find a viable gubernatorial candidate. The party has virtually no power in Tallahassee, with Republicans dominating the legislature and occupying every state cabinet seat. Democrats have not won a race for governor there since 1994. Polling over the summer showed Crist with a double-digit lead over Scott.   \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive to run in Florida,\u201d Gelber said. \u201cVery few people in Florida have any identity other than major sports figures and a precious few elected officials. He is one of the handful that does. And it\u2019s a very positive one.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Not every Democrat is pleased with the rush to nominate Crist. The man Crist defeated in 2006, former congressman Jim Davis of Tampa, said he is strongly encouraging Sen. Bill Nelson, Florida\u2019s only statewide elected Democrat, to enter the race. Davis wasn\u2019t ready to say the party had settled on Crist. \u201cYesterday\u2019s establishment is not today\u2019s opinion leaders,\u201d he said. Crist faces a primary challenge from Nan Rick, a liberal former state senator\n who says her profile is a far better fit for the state\u2019s Democratic voters. Rich, in an interview, attributed the high-level party support for Crist as a reflection of his relationship with Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a circle there that has been supportive of [Crist], or supportive of this idea, because they inaccurately and mistakenly believe that Charlie is the only one who can beat Rick Scott,\u201d she said. Crist and his backers point to key moments that help him stake his claim as a legitimate Democrat. Among them: his move in 2008 to keep crowded voting locations, many of them heavily African American with large turnout in favor of Obama, open late to allow everyone to cast their ballots; his support for restoring felons\u2019 voting rights; his support for Obama\u2019s stimulus plan, which Crist referenced indirectly as his support for helping thousands of teachers avoid layoffs; and his veto of a GOP-backed teacher tenure bill. As a state lawmaker, Crist fought rate increases by power companies, winning praise from consumer advocates. The long-beleaguered Florida Democrats have been unable to attract another top-tier challenger to Scott. So as Crist methodically introduced himself to activists, party officials offered their help as advisers and tour guides. State GOP Chairman Lenny Curry said Republicans will criticize Crist for deciding, after one term, to run for Senate instead of reelection at a time when the state was experiencing an economic meltdown. \u201cHe\u2019s just not a serious person,\u201d Curry said.", "topics": ["politics"], "author": "Peter Wallsten", "wordCount": 819}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Court asked to define \u2018clothes\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/334c89e5/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Ccourt0Easked0Eto0Edefine0Eclothes0C20A130C110C0A40C42cbcc90A0E45880E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ipolitics/story01.htm", "text": "A seemingly simple phrase can sometimes become stubbornly opaque when the lawyers at the Supreme Court get to it, and that was the case Monday when the justices examined what \u201cchanging clothes\u201d means \n. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t It is part of a case brought by Clifton Sandifer and 800 current and former workers at the U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind. They claim federal law requires them to be compensated for the time they spend putting on protective gear before reporting to their work stations. U.S. Steel said the workers need not be paid because of an exception in the law that allows employers and unions to agree not to pay for \u201cany time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday.\u201d Such an agreement is in place in Gary. While washing is not part of the dispute, what constitutes \u201cclothes\u201d is at the heart of the matter. Sandifer\u2019s lawyer, Eric Schnapper of Seattle, said that \u201cnot everything an individual wears is clothes.\u201d He said it should not be difficult to differentiate between normal clothes and something unique that industrial workers must don and doff. \u201cOur test is: An item is not clothes if it is worn to protect against a workplace hazard and was designed to protect against hazards,\u201d he told the justices. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit didn\u2019t accept that and previously ruled against the workers, who are required to wear flame-retardant jackets, pants, snood, gloves, wristlets and leggings. That court took a picture of a model wearing the attire, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held it up for Schnapper. \u201cFrom the picture, that looks like clothes to me,\u201d she said. Schnapper said this is a case in which a picture does not tell the story. But Ginsburg said there were all kinds of jobs that require uniforms \u2014 bakers or doormen, for instance \u2014 and no one believes they should be paid for putting on clothing. And there was a bit of real-life experience from the court. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who worked summers in a steel plant to help pay for college, said there were particularly thick blue jeans that workers would wear at the plant but not elsewhere. Don\u2019t those protect from workplace hazards, he asked. Attorney Lawrence DiNardo, representing the steel company, said that the focus should not be on the items a worker wears, but the process of getting ready for work. \u201cCollective bargaining does not focus on whether or not a shirt is clothes or a pair of pants are clothes or protective eye gear, and that is how the statute was written,\u201d DiNardo said. \u201cGiven those two points, the term \u2018clothes\u2019 as used in the statute was intended to encompass the work outfit industrial workers were required to change into and out of to be ready for work. \u201c Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that would make something like a scuba tank \u201cclothes\u201d for some workers. And she had other examples: \u201cYour definition would include somebody spending an hour of putting on a suit of armor if he\u2019s going to be a jouster. It would include the space people who put on that complicated white suit that has all the connections to equipment.\u201d The government proposed that the court differentiate between clothes and equipment. \u201cFor instance,\u201d said Assistant Solicitor General Anthony M. Yang, \u201cthe meat packer might have a chain mail\u201d kind of sleeve, chain-mail gloves and a Plexiglass \u201cbelly guard\u201d as part of his work attire. Those would not be considered \u201cclothes,\u201d he said. Interest groups representing manufacturers and others said a ruling in favor of the workers could have a huge impact in back pay and other costs. At the end of the hour-long argument, Justice Elena Kagan wondered why a government agency had never tackled the question of what the statute means when it says \u201cclothes.\u201d Schnapper said he did not know, but Justice Antonin Scalia offered a reason. \u201cToo complicated is why,\u201d he said.

Bradley Byrne is the establishment choice. On Saturday, each made his case to a group of Republicans gathered at Mama Lou\u2019s Restaurant here. When it was his turn, Young waved off the microphone and announced in his baritone drawl that \u201cthe nation is watching.\u201d A Christian conservative aligned with the tea party, Young urged voters to send him to Washington so he can help return the country \u201cto the Constitution and the godly principles that made this nation great.\u201d But the national attention he alluded to has to do with a full-scale effort by the business wing of the GOP to stop him from winning the party\u2019s nomination Tuesday. They prefer Byrne, a mild-mannered lawyer who minutes earlier focused his remarks on health care and the budget. Polls show that the special-election runoff could go either way. The race has become the latest front in the fight for a divided and troubled Republican Party. Stung by the recent government shutdown and debt-ceiling turmoil, business groups are intensifying their efforts to elect like-minded candidates such as Byrne who are disinclined to push the economy to the brink of disaster again. Standing in their way is a grass-roots movement, embodied by Young, that is irate with the federal government and spoiling for another fight, no matter the political costs. \u201cI think the business community is looking at races and at primaries more closely than we have been in the past,\u201d said David French, the chief lobbyist at the National Retail Federation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has endorsed Byrne, a business lawyer and former state senator who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010. The group has spent at least $199,000 on mailers, phone calls and digital media to help him, campaign finance records show. Byrne last month received a flurry of big donations from the political action committees of AT&T, Home Depot, Exxon Mobil and Wal-Mart, to name a few. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s leadership PAC also gave him money. A Byrne victory would lend momentum to an effort by the Republican establishment to wrest control of the GOP from the tea party faction, which has dominated the debate over the past three years. The battle is already on for other seats in 2014, including two in Michigan held by Reps. Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio, tea party favorites who have drawn primary challengers. Retiree Ben Butzbaugh, 69, who plans to vote for Byrne, said he doesn\u2019t want someone who will go to Washington just to be a rabble-rouser: \u201cI hope we don\u2019t send people up there to make a lot of noise and shut down the government.\u201d \n Understated vs. wild card \n An understated man with neatly parted, thinning white hair, Byrne bills himself as a problem-solver who wants to make government work better. At an event last week in the town of Dauphin Island, Byrne called Young a \u201cshow horse\u201d who is interested only in agitation.   \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for somebody who\u2019s just going to go up there and fight, he\u2019s your guy,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cIf you\u2019re searching for somebody who\u2019s going to up there and fight and be effective, I\u2019m your guy.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The son of a truck salesman and a bookkeeper, Byrne, 58, is a former Democrat who made his first foray into public office in the 1990s when he was elected to the State Board of Education. He later served in the state Senate as a Republican and was appointed head of Alabama\u2019s two-year college system in 2007 before running for governor in 2010. He says a seat in Congress would be his last elected position. An advocate of repealing the federal health-care law, Byrne said he did not support the bipartisan Senate compromise to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling because it was \u201ckicking the can down the road.\u201d And he\u2019s noncommittal about backing Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) for another term as House speaker. But he worries about the consequences of shuttering the government, setting him apart from his opponent. \u201cAnybody who tells you it\u2019s a good thing to shut down the federal government, they really don\u2019t understand our whole national system,\u201d he said. Young disagrees. \u201cThe shutdown was not the end of the world,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I said it should still be shut down until we get some real answers and get some real changes in Washington.\u201d A real estate developer who names Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) as his favorite Washington Republicans, Young, 49, says that the federal government needs a \u201ccomplete overhaul\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s almost immoral\u201d to \u201ckeep adding to the deficit.\u201d He is a social conservative who has disparaged Byrne as a product of the GOP establishment and has flatly ruled out supporting Boehner for another term as speaker. He\u2019s also a controversial figure who has earned a reputation as a wild card. His outspoken opposition to same-sex marriage has drawn scrutiny (\u201cI\u2019m against homosexuals pretending like they\u2019re married,\u201d he said in a local TV interview). And his biggest local supporter is state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, known best for his refusal to take down a monument to the Ten Commandments he installed in the court\u2019s building. Young\u2019s volatility may explain why most national tea party groups have steered clear of the race . The anti-tax Club for Growth hasn\u2019t spent any money, nor has FreedomWorks or the Tea Party Express. Alabama Republican strategist Brent Buchanan said the groups probably \u201cdon\u2019t want to be associated\u201d with some of Young\u2019s statements. Despite a dearth of money and national help, Young boasts a key coalition of evangelical Christian supporters, which concerned Byrne\u2019s campaign enough that it ran an ad accusing Young of using Christian donors\u2019 contributions to his PAC for personal gain. Young has also tapped into a base of voters who think Republicans have compromised too often. \u201cThe people I\u2019m talking to here \u2014 and this isn\u2019t just tea party people \u2014 they\u2019re disgusted with Republicans caving in,\u201d said Pete Riehm, a tea party activist who is backing Young. \n \u2018It\u2019s okay to get angry\u2019 \n Alabama\u2019s 1st District, based in Mobile and bounded by the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Mississippi to the west, is safe Republican territory where Mitt Romney won more than six in 10 votes. The winner of Tuesday\u2019s GOP runoff will be a virtual lock to win the Dec. 17 general election. But it\u2019s not a tea party stronghold, strategists say. Jo Bonner, a traditional conservative Republican, represented the district from 2003 until he resigned this year to take a job in the University of Alabama system. Bonner backs Byrne and called him a candidate \u201cin the mold\u201d of all the district\u2019s previous representatives. David Mowery, an Alabama political strategist who has worked with clients of both parties, said, \u201cI think the typical voter in this district is a moderate conservative who values common sense over extremism.\u201d Byrne\u2019s team has been looking to boost turnout in the closing days. The candidate spent Friday evening stumping at a high school football game, encouraging people to show up at the polls. About 52,000 people cast ballots in the September primary election, in which no candidate won a majority. Turnout could be even lighter Tuesday. Undecided voters such as Daniel Scarcliff, who owns a bakery, could hold the key to victory \u2014 not only in the 1st District but in the broader struggle for control of the Republican Party. After listening to Byrne on Dauphin Island, Scarcliff offered the candidate some advice. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to get angry sometimes,\u201d he said.", "topics": ["politics"], "author": "Sean

"text": "Privacy advocates and at least one U.S. senator are expressing concern that legislation introduced Thursday would not only endorse the National Security Agency\u2019s collection of all Americans\u2019 phone records, but also give the agency permission to collect massive amounts of their e-mail records. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which advanced out of the Senate Intelligence Committee, would codify limits that a special court has placed on the NSA\u2019s use of the records. But if the FISA Improvements Act became law, Congress would be validating expansive powers that have been claimed by the NSA and upheld by a court \u2014 but never explicitly written into statute \u2014 to harvest the phone and e-mail records of millions of Americans, the advocates say. \u201cThe bill that the intelligence committee voted on this week would expressly authorize this bulk collection for the first time, and that would be a huge step backward for the rights of law-abiding Americans,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of four committee members who voted against moving the bill. Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who cosponsored the 45-page bill with Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), has said the phone records program is legal and that though they want to place some limits on it, she will do everything she can to prevent it from being halted. Committee staff disputed the critics\u2019 contention that the bill, which amends the \u201cbusiness records\u201d provision of FISA, would authorize harvesting of e-mail metadata. That includes the \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfrom\u201d lines, date and time stamp, and file size. \u201cWe do not understand business records to include Internet metadata,\u201d said a committee aide, who was not permitted to speak on the record. \u201cThe committee neither intended to authorize nor prohibit e-mail records collection through this provision,\u201d the aide said, but rather sought to focus on the phone records program, which collects phone numbers and call duration but not content. Authorizing e-mail metadata surveillance \u201cis certainly not our intent.\u201d And, he added, the committee is willing \u201cto deal with this if it\u2019s a problem as the bill moves forward.\u201d The NSA in 2011 halted a program to gather e-mail metadata in bulk because it was not operationally useful, officials have said, though it is possible the data are collected in other ways. In any case, Wyden and privacy advocates object to the codifying of the authority. Several former senior Justice Department officials, who were not permitted by their current employers to speak on the record, said that e-mail metadata are clearly a business record. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic business record,\u201d one former official said. \u201cIt\u2019s a record that\u2019s created by the company for the purpose of providing a service. It\u2019s not created at the request of law enforcement or the government.\u201d Another former official said Internet companies\u2019 servers \u201ccreate logs for security purposes and to detect fraud, so yes, business records comprised of Internet metadata are generated as part of the company\u2019s ordinary course of business.\u201d And, he added, \u201cthat would include Gmail or Hotmail or any of those services.\u201d   Wyden and privacy advocates are also concerned that the bill would place in statute authority for NSA to search without a warrant for Americans\u2019 e-mail and phone call content collected under a separate FISA surveillance program intended to target foreigners overseas. That is what Wyden has called a \u201cback-door search loophole.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Aides note the bill restricts the queries to those meant to obtain foreign intelligence information. They say that there have been only a \u201csmall number\u201d of queries each year. Such searches are useful, for instance, if a tip arises that a terrorist group is plotting to kill or kidnap an American, officials have said. Nonetheless, the bill\u2019s language, privacy advocates said, leaves room for the FISA court, which oversees NSA\u2019s domestic surveillance, to interpret it expansively. They point as precedent to the recent revelation \u2014 following the leak of a classified court order by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden \u2014 that the court, which operates in secret, had authorized the sweeping phone records collection based on what they say is a bafflingly elastic reading of the underlying statute. That statute \u2014 also known as Section 215 of the Patriot Act \u2014 requires that the records sought be \u201crelevant\u201d to an authorized foreign terrorism investigation. And the FISA court, it is now known, interpreted \u201crelevant\u201d to include all call logs held by U.S. phone companies, enabling NSA\u2019s amassing of billions of domestic phone records.\n \u201cThe court accepted the NSA\u2019s argument that all of the records qualified as relevant because a tiny fraction of them might prove to be relevant in the future,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program. \u201cIt turned what was supposed to be a limiting principle into a license to cast a dragnet.\u201d Moreover, the bill\u2019s effort to impose limits could also have the unintended effect of enabling authorities not currently claimed by the government, they said. That is because the bill\u2019s limits on bulk collection of \u201celectronic communication records\u201d could imply that no such conditions exist for mass collection of other types of records, such as tax or credit card records, they said. \u201cThe best-case scenario is the bill locks in and authorizes the current conduct of the U.S. government,\u201d said Julian Sanchez, a research fellow at the CATO Institute. \u201cThe worst-case scenario is it gives them an argument to expand the use of that authority.\u201d\n\n A competing version of reform legislation is pending in Congress. The USA Freedom Act, co-sponsored by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), one of the original authors of the Patriot Act, would end the phone records program as part of a broader package of changes. That bill has not yet been taken up by the Judiciary Committee. Senate leadership aides said it was too early to know when the Feinstein bill might receive floor consideration.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "food"], "author": "Ellen Nakashima", "wordCount": 977}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Thanksgiving turkeys for sale by farms in the Washington area", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636606/s/332c1693/sc/4/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cfood0Cthanksgiving0Eturkeys0Efor0Esale0Eby0Efarms0Ein0Ethe0Ewashington0Earea0C20A130C10A0C310Cd38e56a80E3b380E11e30Eb7ba0E50A3fb5822c3e0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ifood/story01.htm", "text": "With Thanksgiving falling late this year, on Nov. 28, it would be easy to let your planning slip.

Fourteenth Street NW has hogged most of the ink and the bandwidth, with the debuts of such standard-bearers as Etto , Le Diplomate, Doi Moi \nand Kapnos , but other neighborhoods share credit for burnishing the Washington dining scene as well. No sooner did it open its doors this fall than Rose\u2019s Luxury became the best place to eat on Capitol Hill, and Daikaya improved the odds of getting a good meal near Verizon Center with two fine menus under one roof, one devoted to ramen, the other to upscale Japanese pub fare. By the time you read this, Iron Gate Inn should have made a comeback in Dupont Circle, with ace chef Tony Chittum at the stove. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The crush of so many fresh subjects to write about means I\u2019ve had less time to keep tabs on restaurants that have fed food fans for a while, which is a long way of congratulating Buck\u2019s Fishing & Camping on the occasion of its 10th anniversary in October. A decade might not seem like a long time to most people; for those of us steeped in the industry, however, 10 years is practically middle age. Among the constants in its picture have been Buck\u2019s signature blood-red walls; its (truly) prime dry-aged New York strip steak; and owner James Alefantis, 38. The restaurateur retains the boyish charm he has always had and mixes easily and gleefully with the many notables \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard \u2014 who add sizzle to the American restaurant, a Cafe Milano for boldface names who care about good food. There\u2019s probably nothing you haven\u2019t heard of on Buck\u2019s short menu, but there are few local kitchens that do its familiar dishes better. I\u2019ve munched on fields of onion rings over the years, but few plates compel me to get to the bottom like the one at Buck\u2019s. The snack appears too white to have been fried, but sure enough, the crisp rings in light coats of beer batter have been expertly cooked. They\u2019re great alone, sensational after a dunk in smoked pepper mayonnaise, a detail that underscores how the kitchen distinguishes itself is small ways. A fist of cool iceberg lettuce is dressed up with the usual garnishes \u2014 crumbles of smoky bacon and blue cheese \u2014 but sets itself apart from the pack with a creamy, horseradish-sharpened dressing. Butternut squash soup is, frankly, boring in contrast. Did anyone taste the bland bowl before it went out? Roasted almonds tossed with fresh rosemary, on the other hand, is a nibble I plan to put out on my coffee table at my next dinner party. \u201cWorld-Famous\u201d precedes that steak on the menu, and while I might not go that far, the $39 entree is a terrific piece of meat that picks up lots of flavor from being cooked over wood and comes flanked by potatoes that are, as any good chef knows, fried twice to make them crisp. (The poor man\u2019s version here is the steak frites featuring an eight-ounce culotte for $19.) I\u2019m just as happy eating the bone-in pork chop, with meat from a farm on the Eastern Shore that grows its own feed for the pigs. A side of fresh, barely creamy cole slaw makes the grill-striped main dish even more compelling.   James Rexroad is only the fourth person to helm the kitchen. Like his predecessors, including the memorable opening chef, Carole Greenwood, he opts for good sense over high style. Rockfish gets framed in basil-laced cranberry and kidney beans, while plump roast chicken is brightened with lemony pan juices. Both dishes are more about ingredients than a chef showing off. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n The single meatless entree sounds like a page from the original \u201cMoosewood Cookbook,\u201d hearty and retro. But quinoa bulked up with sauteed mushrooms, wilted chard and a beautiful poached egg on top pleased even the dedicated cavemen at my table with its nutty nuances and gentle but persistent heat from serrano oil. \nI can easily pass on chocolate. The flavor is seldom my thing, except at Buck\u2019s, where I always order a fat slice of the chocolate buttermilk cake, which comes with a glossy drape of chocolate sauce, added just before serving, and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. My mom makes a similar comfort, moist and not too sweet. Whatever fruit is in season might be turned into something quietly wonderful, too. Recently, there was apple crisp, which I like because the fruit remains the focus. Looks matter to Alefantis, who also heads the board of the Transformer gallery. Over the bar hangs a fetching riff on Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus\u201d; the oil-on-linen nude was painted by former Washington artist Lucy Hogg. A sense of intimacy comes by way of glass-blown amber lights over the 20-foot-long poplar table that runs down the center of the dining room. And yes, after all these years, there\u2019s still a canoe displayed in the rafters.\n Alefantis says he\u2019s as close to a \u201cBuck\u201d as you will find at Buck\u2019s. The name lends a sense of folksiness to the establishment, while \u201cFishing & Camping\u201d is a subtle way of promoting the restaurant\u2019s commitment to locality. (To the owner\u2019s amusement, he says he gets the occasional call from people inquiring about fishing licenses.) The staff tends to be relaxed and smart and swift. Nour Bouzarda is first among equals, not just because the Morocco native makes me feel as if I\u2019m eating in his home but because he has the gift of reading a diner\u2019s mind. Unlike the servers at too many hot spots, Bouzarda comes across as honored to have you rather than making you feel privileged to have him . Plus, he makes excellent wine recommendations. The restaurant scene is ablaze with new stars. Buck\u2019s testifies to the allure, and the value, of patina in the firmament.              \n \n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2605\n\u2605\n\n\u00bd stars\n \n (Good/Excellent) \n \n Buck\u2019s Fishing & Camping \n 5031 Connecticut Ave. NW. 202-364-0777. bucksfishingandcamping.com.\n \n\n \n\n OPEN: \n Dinner 5 to 9:30 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 5 to 9 p.m. Sunday.\n \n\n\n PRICES: Appetizers $8 to $14, main courses $14 to $39.\n \n\n SOUND CHECK: \n 75 decibels/Must speak with raised voice.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "food"], "author": "Tom Sietsema", "wordCount": 1042}, {"date": "2013-10-30 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Chat Leftovers: Ginger for vampires", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636606/s/33173d1f/sc/4/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cfood0Cchat0Eleftovers0Eginger0Efor0Evampires0C20A130C10A0C30A0C13d8a7b0A0E40Af0A0E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ifood/story01.htm", "text": "Do you know about search engine optimization?

Or almost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But more on that later! First, let\u2019s explore what Food has to offer this week, starting with Emily Kaiser Thelin \u2019s bittersweet story about Paula Wolfert , a noted cookbook author who at 75 is battling the cognitive decline that accompanies dementia. Bonnie S. Benwick welcomes London superstar chefs Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi to the Washington Post kitchen and watches them cook. And David Hagedorn can\u2019t resist buying the new Veg-O-Matic to see how it compares with the original model that nearly ruined his childhood. Will it slice and dice? Read and find out. Emily and David will be the special guests for today\u2019s Free Range chat , so, as usual, plan to be there too with your questions or comments. Or just lurk; we\u2019re fine with that. But show up at noon and get ready for a scintillating hour. Here\u2019s a great question we didn\u2019t have time to answer during a previous chat: \n\n I peel my ginger and store it refrigerated in sherry. A splash of the sherry usually goes into my stir-fry sauce. There have been questions the past couple of weeks about how to store unused ginger root, and none of the experts mentioned this as a possibility. I don\u2019t remember where I read about handling it this way, but if you aren\u2019t recommending it, is there potential danger? It certainly stays fragrant and crunchy. I have been doing it for years and we have not gotten sick. \n\n If you\u2019ve been doing it for years and haven\u2019t gotten sick, then I think you have your answer. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Thankfully, the folks at Fine Cooking magazine have already helped us out. They refrigerated ginger root 10 ways to see which worked best. Six pieces of ginger were peeled and submerged in different liquids, and four were left unpeeled and stored in the vegetable drawer in different kinds of wrappings. An 11th contender was planted in soil. After eight weeks, the ginger was retrieved and compared. Here\u2019s some validation for you: Sherry was one of the liquids they experimented with, and it left the ginger in decent shape. However, compared with the rest of the pack, the sherry didn\u2019t shine: \u201cThe clear winner was the ginger stored in vodka, which produced firm, crisp ginger that still had a strong flavor.\u201d Down in the vegetable drawer, the best results came from just chucking the ginger directly into a zip-top bag. The ginger buried in soil stayed fresh, but you wouldn\u2019t want to have to dig yours up every time you wanted a piece. You can read all the details about their experiment here . I have a 12th recommendation. A few years ago I got ginger to root in a glass of water. It sent up pretty stalks and leaves that looked a lot like bamboo, and it also started growing new knobs that could be cut off and cooked with. I didn\u2019t want to keep it going indefinitely (it got BIG) but it was a fun experiment, and as I said, the foliage is nice and kind of perked up the kitchen window sill. Here\u2019s a blogpost I wrote a while after I tried it. Also, a couple of the chatters had recommended freezing ginger and said it works beautifully. As for you, though the vodka bath apparently is more effective, it seems like the sherry method still would suit you best. I just can\u2019t imagine wanting to make stir-fries with ginger-flavored vodka.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "food"], "author": "Jane Touzalin", "wordCount": 640}, {"date": "2013-10-29 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Republic to pay homage to Takoma Park\u2019s DIY eclecticism", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636606/s/3311650f/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cgoing0Eout0Egurus0Cpost0Crepublic0Eto0Epay0Ehomage0Eto0Etakoma0Eparks0Ediy0Eeclecticism0C20A130C10A0C290C10Ada93dc0E40Ade0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ifood/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["lifestyle", "food"], "author": "Tim Carman", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-10-29 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Weeknight Vegetarian: Bulgur in my soup", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636606/s/3310c4bc/sc/14/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cfood0Cweeknight0Evegetarian0Ebulgur0Ein0Emy0Esoup0C20A130C10A0C280Cb2c1b7460E3dc50E11e30Eb6a90Eda62c264f40Ae0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ifood/story01.htm", "text": "Remember when the only time you ate bulgur was in tabbouleh?

Bulgur, a cracked wheat, cooks so quickly that it\u2019s a perfect addition to any soup where you want a bit of its chew \u2014 not to mention its extra hit of protein.  When I spied a beautiful pureed beet soup in a cookbook the other day, it gave me the idea to roast the beets that were hanging out in my fridge, but also to throw in some bulgur (which cooked right in the broth) and kale for a little variety. All of a sudden, the soup was a chunky stew, and the bulgur got to play in a recipe that didn\u2019t include a speck of parsley. That\u2019s just one idea, of many.

And they don\u2019t taste like traditional beers: spritzy, light on the palate in spite of their nine percent alcohol, with tart, fruity flavors hinting of apples, pears, plums and blackberries. \u00a0In fact, the brands are beer-wine hybrids, fermented from wheat and kosher varietal grape juice: chardonnay in the case of Golden Knot, merlot for the Crimson Crossing. Coming from a small regional brewery, such beers wouldn\u2019t raise eyebrows. Craft brewers are supposed to think outside the box. Dogfish Head in Milton, Del., has incorporated grapes in several of its beers, and Flying Dog Brewery in Frederick has announced the forthcoming release of Vineyard Blonde, brewed with vidal blanc grape juice from Breaux Vineyards in Purcellville. But Golden Knot and Crimson Crossing are part of the new Vintage Ale Collection from Blue Moon Brewing. That\u2019s a specialty division of MillerCoors, the nation\u2019s second-largest brewing company. These beers are brewed in 1,000-barrel kettles at Coors\u2019s mother ship brewery in Golden, Colo., according to Keith Villa, founder and head brew master of Blue Moon. One batch is enough to supply the entire nation. \u201cI actually created these beers back in 1995,\u201d says Villa, who was given free rein to fashion new recipes at SandLot, a 10-barrel brewpub at Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies\u2019 ballpark. \u201cBut back then, beer and wine existed in separate worlds.\u201d America\u2019s beer palate has become a lot more eclectic. \u201cWe\u2019ve served these beers at festivals in wine country on the West Coast and found wine lovers are turned on by our Vintage Collection,\u201d says Villa, who purposely omitted barley from the recipes to let the grapes shine forth. As growth of the U.S. craft segment continues at a double-digit clip, MillerCoors wants a piece of the action. Besides the Vintage beers, Blue Moon premiered two other lines this fall. The Expressionist Collection consists of Belgian styles with a twist. Short Straw Farmhouse Red Ale, for instance, combines the spiciness of a saison with the sour fruit of a Belgian-style red ale in the Rodenbach mold. The Graffiti Collection is a catch-all category that encompasses such free-style brands as Pine in the Neck, an IPA flavored with juniper berries, and Tongue Thai-ed, an ale spiced with lemon grass and basil. Of course, MillerCoors continues to churn out oceanic quantities of Blue Moon Belgian White, which Villa touts as the best-selling craft brand in the nation. If you consider it \u201ccraft.\u201d And therein hangs a controversy. The Boulder, Colo.-based Brewers Association, which represents most of the 2,500-plus breweries operating in the United States, defines a craft brewery as \u201csmall, traditional, and independent.\u201d The association has employed the word \u201ccrafty\u201d to describe corporate aliases such as Blue Moon Brewing and Anheuser-Busch\u2019s Shock Top Brewing, which (the group contends) can make consumers think those beers come from small, locally owned bricks-and-mortar breweries.   The BA\u2019s board of directors last month released a statement calling for transparency in labeling, encouraging all brewers \u201cto disclose to consumers their ownership of beer brands, including the name of the parent brewery that owns the brand, on the brand\u2019s labeling to enable consumers to make informed buying choices.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Representatives of the large brewers contend there\u2019s no intent to deceive. So why call it Blue Moon Belgian White and not Coors Belgian White? Villa uses the analogy of auto companies setting up separate divisions for their luxury vehicles: \u201cNowhere in the advertising for Lexus do they mention the parent company, Toyota. But you don\u2019t hear people say, don\u2019t buy a Lexus, it\u2019s really a product of Toyota.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re trying to fool anyone,\u201d says Peter Kraemer, Anheuser-Busch\u2019s vice president of supply and its chief brew master. He says beer-savvy drinkers, the ones who care most about where their brew originated, are likely to have apps that will give them that information with a few taps on a smartphone. It has been a smoldering issue, and the magazine Consumer Reports might have thrown more gasoline on the fire when it awarded its CR Best Buy stamp of approval to Shock Top Wheat IPA in a tasting of \u201ccraft\u201d beers that appeared in its August issue. In fairness, not all of the specialty beers flowing out of large breweries\u2019 tanks attempt to hide their origins. On Monday, Anheuser-Busch released its second annual Project 12, a variety 12-pack of three experimental lagers fermented with the Budweiser yeast. The packages and labels carry the Bud logo, and the beers take their names from the Zip codes of the plants where they\u2019re produced. One of the three is Batch 23185, a bourbon-and-vanilla lager from the company\u2019s brewery in Williamburg, Va. Senior brew master Daniel Westmoreland created the recipe, aging the tawny lager on barrel staves from a Virginia distillery and sacks of Madagascar vanilla beans. He first brewed the beer in 2012 and upped the flavor this time around in response to customer comments. Could Batch 23185 become part of the company\u2019s regular product line? An amber lager from last year\u2019s Project 12 assortment was rechristened Budweiser Black Crown and promoted to year-round status. \u201cThat would be the ultimate honor for a brew master,\u201d says Westmoreland, but he cautions that his recipe is labor-intensive and, needing one oak stave per barrel of beer, would require a large and steady stream of used distiller\u2019s wood. Regardless of the size of the brewery, a beer can\u2019t be cost-prohibitive. It has to sell briskly enough to justify its continued production. That\u2019s a bigger challenge when you\u2019re brewing in increments of 500 barrels (the batch size in Williamsburg) instead of 25 or 50. Apparently, Shock Top Wheat IPA didn\u2019t make the grade. Ironically, the brand had been yanked by the time Consumer Reports bestowed its plaudits. \n Kitsock is the editor of Mid-Atlantic Brewing News.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "food"], "author": "Greg Kitsock", "wordCount": 983}, {"date": "2013-10-29 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Black rice tortillas for Halloween", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636606/s/3310c727/sc/26/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cfood0Cblack0Erice0Etortillas0Efor0Ehalloween0C20A130C10A0C280C9372b5140E3ddb0E11e30Eb6a90Eda62c264f40Ae0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ifood/story01.htm", "text": "SAVORY HALLOWEEN TREAT: Food for Life\u2019s black rice tortillas, along with a sharp knife, could make a meal delightfully scary.

It\u2019s part of how they are supposedly revolutionizing wine and the way we drink it. Marketing types have noticed that as well, and we can expect advertisements to show people downing wine in places and ways unaccustomed, such as in bowling alleys and (gasp) on the rocks. The message is that wine is an everyday drink to be consumed however we like, without regard to stuffy conventions or rules. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t That ideal of \u201csocial drinking\u201d \u2014 as though dinner is an antisocial activity \u2014 has sprouted an insurgent movement among wine writers who decry the idea of food-and-wine pairings. Such maxims as \u201cwhite wine with fish, red wine with meat,\u201d however outdated that one is, smack of rules. These writers want to liberate you from the bondage of snobbery; they denounce pairings as traps meant to enslave timid tipplers and take away their vinous freedom to drink as they choose. Why anyone other than a modern-day Carrie Nation would want to do that is never explained. Wait a minute. Millennials aren\u2019t the first generation to drink wine away from the table. The cook\u2019s adage that wine for the sauce should be good enough to drink has an internal logic to it: There might be half or more of the bottle left for the cook to sip as the sauce bubbles away. Who hasn\u2019t enjoyed a glass or two at a reception? Or watched a beautiful sunset with a glass of ros\u00e9 in hand? And remember all those 1980s wine-and-cheese parties? Those were social occasions. The diatribe against food-and-wine pairings really gets my nonsense alarm sounding full blast. It\u2019s a counterclaim to the mantra that wine is food and is meant to be consumed with food. That, in turn, was a reaction against the idea that wine can be judged in isolation and given point scores that rank one wine\u2019s superiority over another. Winemakers disappointed with their scores cried foul. Wine, they argued, was meant to be enjoyed over the course of a dinner, not robbed of its context and evaluated with a simple swirl, sniff and spit. Even if the general wine-drinking public is downing more wine away from the table, it is still drinking wine with dinner. Who doesn\u2019t consider the menu when choosing a dinner wine? There are no rules; you are free to drink whatever you like with whatever you\u2019re eating. But guidelines such as matching a tannic red with steak, a crisp, acidic white with briny shellfish or a slightly sweet wine with hot, spicy food can enhance your meal. A muscadet might be perfect with raw shellfish, while an oaky chardonnay would seem clumsy. Put those wines with chicken in a cream sauce, and the muscadet might disappear on your palate while the chardonnay shines. That\u2019s why opting for the wine pairings on a restaurant tasting menu can be so much fun. There\u2019s a kaleidoscope of possibility. The anarchic democratization of wine, this idea that anything goes and everything is right, devalues wine by stripping it of its mystery. If nothing matters, why bother exploring different wines, their regions, their styles?\u00a0 These liberators would make wine nothing but a drink. It\u2019s that, yet so much more. \n McIntyre blogs at dmwineline.com .

It\u2019s a smart plan for someone like her, in the early stages of cognitive impairment, when organization problems can first appear. But Wolfert\u2019s definition of \u201csimple\u201d has never been anyone else\u2019s. Her eight seminal cookbooks on the foods of the Mediterranean are famous \u2014 some might say infamous \u2014 for their complexity, for challenging us to be better cooks.\n Over her four-decade career, she would often test a few recipes a day. Meals for herself and her husband of 30 years, crime novelist Bill Bayer, could get eclectic: duck confit, a dish she popularized in 1983 with \u201cThe Cooking of Southwest France\u201d; a Syrian dish spiked with aleppo pepper, a spice she introduced to American chefs in 1994 with \u201c The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean .\u201d On a recent weekday at her airy house here, she has pulled an apron over a gray-and black-striped scoop-neck tee. Her short chestnut hair is brushed away from her face, revealing brown eyes aglow with the rush of cooking good food. Her lunch menu looks just as eclectic and ambitious as ever. She has been revisiting favorite recipes, casually considering an anthology. Today\u2019s include seared scallops with tangerine sauce from \u201c The Cooking of Southwest France \u201d (1983) and slow-cooked mushrooms from \u201c Mediterranean Clay Pot Cooking \u201d (2009). She washes her hands before giving the scallops a quick toss in their marinade, which includes parsley and thyme from her garden. Later, when she broils them, she\u2019ll flip each scallop, sizzling hot, with her bare fingertips. (She still has the asbestos hands of a line cook, numb to heat.) Then something unusual happens. She turns to \u201cThe Cooking of Southwest France,\u201d lying open on the counter, and reads from her own recipe. \u201cBring to a boil and add cream,\u201d she says, readying her measuring cups. When she is about to pour, she turns back to the book. \u201cIs it a third of a cup or a half? I forget everything as soon as I read it.\u201d Wolfert has turned into a cook like the rest of us, judging by appearances. Rather like when Superman surrendered his powers to try life as a mortal, this new phase is giving her profound insight. She looks up from the book and laughs. \u201cNow that I have to follow my own recipes, some of them are so hard!\u201d It\u2019s good to hear her laugh again. For several years, Wolfert suspected something was wrong. In its earliest stages, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is surprisingly hard to detect. The telltale proteins that may cause degeneration can be confirmed only by a brain sample taken at autopsy. For a living patient, doctors look to other signs, including memory loss and other difficulties in functioning. Yet the illness can affect the brain for up to two decades before symptoms are noticed. It\u2019s common for patients, even doctors, to dismiss the first signs as aging or fatigue. Wolfert is also something of a hypochondriac. When she first started forgetting words, she complained that she was losing her mind. Friends and her doctor insisted she was fine. Then two years ago, during appearances to promote her most recent book, \u201c The Food of Morocco \u201d (2011), whenever someone asked her a multi-pronged question, \u201cI couldn\u2019t connect three sentences together,\u201d she says. Wolfert started to navigate interviews like an evasive politician. She insisted on receiving questions ahead of time. If a question surprised her, she would redirect.   When she couldn\u2019t follow one query from Leonard Lopate on radio station WNYC, \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s a great question! We don\u2019t have much time, and I really want to talk about the magic of the tagine!\u2019 I can talk about the magic of the tagine for half an hour. I did that a number of times,\u201d she says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Still, her doctor told her there was nothing wrong. Finally, late last year her husband suggested that they have omelets for lunch. Wolfert had studied in the 1950s with Dione Lucas, an early promoter of classic French cooking and perhaps the greatest omelet chef who ever lived (and the first woman ever to appear on a cooking show). Wolfert drew a blank. \u201cI said to Bill, \u2018Wait a minute, how do you make an omelet?\u2019\u200a\u201d She saw two neurologists. Each had a different opinion. One said she had early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease; the other diagnosed mild cognitive impairment, a form of dementia that can progress to Alzheimer\u2019s. Time will tell which one she has, depending on how much she loses. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she says. \u201cI know there\u2019s something wrong. This isn\u2019t the Paula that I used to know.\u201d Dementia is an unpredictable foe. There is no cure and no sure way to slow its progress. In 1983, New York University physician Barry Reisberg delineated seven stages to measure its progress. Wolfert has been told she appears to be at Stage Four, moderate cognitive decline. According to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association , that includes \u201cgreater difficulty performing complex tasks, such as planning dinner for guests,\u201d and \u201cforgetfulness of recent events.\u201d Thankfully, her long-term memories remain crystal clear. When she can\u2019t remember how much cream to add to the tangerine sauce, she remembers where she discovered the sauce: On her first trip to Southwest France in 1978, from a rising-star Gascon chef named Jean-Louis Palladin. \u201cI had never seen food like his,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was so vivid. And his restaurant was beautiful,\u201d she says of La Table des Cordeliers, where, at age 28, Palladin became the youngest chef in history to win two Michelin stars. \u201cHe had a table for the poor in the dining room, where he served leftovers,\u201d she recalls. Palladin left for Washington to open Jean-Louis at the Watergate in 1979, transforming American restaurants forever. Among the first chefs here to cook farm-to-table, Palladin at first lamented to Wolfert and others that he couldn\u2019t find good-quality local ingredients. But that didn\u2019t stop him from looking. \u201cOne time he took us to a part of town in Washington where you could buy live chickens, where we were the only white people,\u201d Wolfert recalls. Then she notices that the mushrooms are scorching. \u201cOh, God, I\u2019m burning things,\u201d she says, and lowers the flame. Wolfert knows that her condition has no cure. But once she was given a diagnosis, she looked to food to help \u2014 not just to keep her mind engaged, but also to see whether superfoods could buy her time: \u201cMy feeling is, accept that it is what it is, but stall it by trying to do as much as possible.\u201d She began taking donepezil, a drug used to treat dementia that might aid cognitive function. She scanned the Internet and started watching \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show\u201d on TV. Her condition became a surprising blessing: After a lifetime of charting different cuisines, now she had a scientific frontier to explore.   After a Uruguayan cardiologist named Alejandro Junger mentioned on \u201cDr. Oz\u201d that inflammation can affect the brain, she tried Junger\u2019s month-long anti-inflammatory Clean Gut cleanse, further popularized by Gwyneth Paltrow . It didn\u2019t restore her short-term memory, but she says she felt healthier and more alert. Now she starts every morning with a smoothie jammed with superfoods that might include seasonal greens, flaxseed, coconut oil, Brazil nuts and a half-dozen vitamins and extracts, such as rosemary extract, curcumin (found in turmeric) and bioperene (found in black pepper). \u201cKeep in mind this is for a warrior, not for a gourmet,\u201d she wrote to her neurologist when she e-mailed her the list of ingredients to confirm that all of it was safe to drink. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t A lifelong ingredient scout \u2014 and pioneer of mail order \u2014 she tapped into her network to find the best superfood sources. To maximize her omega-3s, on the recommendation of a fisherman friend, she ordered 48 six-ounce packages of wild Alaskan king and sockeye salmon from Vital Choice Wild Seafood & Organics ( www.vitalchoice.com ). (She eats only three ounces at a time, using the carbon-steel cleaver she bought as a culinary student of Dione Lucas to hack one frozen fillet in two.) Her favorite Angelo Parodi sardines from Portugal proved too expensive, so she ordered four cases of the more affordable Season brand from Morocco. (\u201cI wish I had more sardine recipes in my books!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get myself to eat two cans a week.\u201d) Wolfert cut back on carbs and gluten after hearing that they might hasten the progression of the illness. She has a light snack in the afternoons, often gluten-free crackers spread with coconut oil. She usually skips dinner, because she\u2019s not hungry and for the supposed benefits of intermittent fasting. Lunch is light, usually seafood and vegetables, followed by an espresso and a square of dark chocolate, both of which might slow memory loss. Is any of it working? The only evidence she can cite is that she looks and feels better than she has in years. \u201cI know I\u2019m not better, but I\u2019m not getting worse,\u201d Wolfert says. While Bayer sets the table, Wolfert opens one of her two dishwashers to clean up before finishing the sauce. The reduction is a throwback to an earlier time, and it sparks memories. As she watches the bright orange sauce bubble and thicken, citrusy scents float up and the recollections rush back. \u201cI remember now! The spoon draws a line through the cream when it\u2019s ready. I used to tell people, \u2018You just catch a glimpse of the bottom of the pan!\u2019\u200a\u201d She shouts that line with the oratory and enthusiasm of Tony Robbins. Before Food Network, through the 1980s, Wolfert was a cooking star, teaching in up to 40 cities a year. With Alzheimer\u2019s, she is teaching again. She went public with her diagnosis last month after reaching out to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association to see how she could help \n.\n As she serves the meal, her husband quietly checks to make sure the cooking appliances have been turned off. The mushrooms are a tad overcooked. But they also have a remarkable intensity from simmering on the stove for just under an hour, one of Wolfert\u2019s simplest recipes. She tastes the scallops. Her face brightens with the delight of someone who has just bumped into an old friend. \u201cThat\u2019s Jean-Louis!\u201d \n Thelin is a writer based in Berkeley, Calif.

Without Food Network fairy dust or a single Stateside bistro, the London chefs have induced a fervor here for their kind of food \u2014 Mediterranean but not! \u2014 that is remarkable to behold. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t In the past five years, more than half a million copies of their cookbooks (one by Ottolenghi, two co-authored) have been sold. The dishes are so vivid on the page, so imbued with color and crunch and inventive combinations that even a casual flip-through gets the stomach growling. More important, the recipes can be re-created by mere mortals. \u201cNo foams. No drops of flavors. No swipes on the plate!\u201d Ottolenghi says. \u201cThe food is bold and colorful.Simple and complex at the same time,\u201d Tamimi says.\n\n There are intriguing entry points to their story that go far beyond the two restaurants (Ottolenghi, Nopi) and three delis they co-own with two other partners. Both born in Jerusalem in 1968, they met as chefs more than 2,000 miles away. Ottolenghi, the worldly intellectual who as a young man left a postgraduate dissertation behind to attend Le Cordon Bleu and worked at enough restaurants to hone his calling, committed to the weekly column he writes for the Guardian. Tamimi, an artist of verse and paint as well as plate, whose food pulled Ottolenghi into his orbit and whose journey to England seems much greater than the distance plotted on a map. Colleagues with complementary talents and quirks. One who is comfortable with the juggernaut of journalist interviews and one who would rather let his craft do the talking. Jew and Arab, longtime friends. \u201cIt\u2019s such a good story, I was surprised that nobody talked about it before,\u201d Ottolenghi says, referring to their role-model coexistence: a Middle East peace via the kitchen. \u201cI believe food brings people together .\u2009.\u2009. having lived in Israel among Arabs and Jews,\u201d Tamimi said in an interview with the newspaper Haaretz this year. \u201cBut the present state of affairs is very sad.\u201d With September\u2019s update of 2008\u2019s \u201c Ottolenghi: The Cookbook \u201d (Ten Speed Press) in which cups, ounces and Farenheit conversions were added, the chefs have sandwiched book tours in between recipe testing for the next two cookbooks and overseeing the restaurants. During last week\u2019s two-day stop in Washington, Ottolenghi and Tamimi had breakfast at NPR; did an interview for Lynne Rossetto Kasper\u2019s \u201cThe Splendid Table\u201d; were feted at a Zaytinya event hosted by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s; spoke and signed books at a sold-out Sixth & I program with Jewish-cooking maven Joan Nathan ; and visited the White House kitchens and garden. \u201cSlight post book tour blues. Highlight was def. White House visit with head chef Cristeta Comerford,\u201d Ottolenghi tweeted with a photo after he returned home. Another takeaway came by way of the \u201camazing\u201d pickled and fried garlic cloves they had at Daikaya Izakaya , served with a dipping sauce of the fiery Korean condiment gochujang, Japanese miso, mirin, chopped kimchi and its juices. \u201cWhen we go to restaurants, we are always on a scouting trip,\u201d Ottolenghi says. \u201cMost chefs are like that. Garlic as a bar snack \u2014 what a lovely idea.\u201d   Daikaya chef Katsuya Fukushima enjoyed the compliment, relayed after the London chefs\u2019 visit. It\u2019s easy to see how \u201cthe Japanese mentality of something simplistic yet very deep,\u201d as he explained the dish, would appeal to the Ottolenghi restaurant aesthetic as stated on its Web site : uncomplicated, unadulterated, emanating from genuine instincts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t They spent time in the Washington Post kitchen, as well, which provided its own memorable moments. \n Counter intelligence \n \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time we actually cooked side by side?\u201d Ottolenghi wonders aloud as he dices a small red onion for a fruity salsa that will accompany tuna. \u201cProfessionally, I can\u2019t recall,\u201d deadpans Tamimi. \u201cBut we were at your house, in the kitchen, three weeks ago.\u201d With his delivery, all that was missing was a rimshot. Onlookers could sense that the chefs\u2019 banter would not progress beyond the gentlest wry commentary. The dapper Tamimi works neat, with a no-crumbs policy; the lanky Ottolenghi professes to being a lazy cook who doesn\u2019t clean as he goes. Each had to consult the chosen recipes in \u201cOttolenghi: The Cookbook\u201d more than once. Ottolenghi the chef takes a bit longer to finish, tasting each ingredient on its own. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than five years since we tested them!\u201d Ottolenghi admits. \u201cWe were testing and retesting.\u201d For the tuna loin crusted with pistachios, he remembers trying a number of ways to get the coating to stick before hitting upon a method of chilling the seared tuna before applying a base coat of Dijon mustard. Mixing in lemon zest with the crushed nuts intensified their flavor \u2014 a consistent goal in the Ottolenghi style. That kind of enhancement was behind the book\u2019s unusual cucumber and poppy seed salad. \u201cWe struggled with the quality of English cucumbers. The small ones we had in the Middle East were not available [in England] till recently,\u201d Tamimi says. \u201cThe poppy seeds give the cucumbers more flavor and texture .\u2009.\u2009. . But if you were wondering, it\u2019s not a Palestinian thing to do.\u201d He assembles the cookbook\u2019s fennel gratin with cherry tomatoes, grateful for bulbs on the small side. He recommends reserving the green stalks, chopped, for ragus. \u201cI heard camels like the flavor of fennel,\u201d the chef says. The casserole\u2019s topping is the result of kitchen revenge: A batch of lemon zest prepped by savory master Tamimi \u201cwent missing\u201d from the restaurant walk-in. The suspect was a pastry chef, so Tamimi appropriated a batch of crumble mix from that side of the refrigerator: flour, butter, sugar. He used it to top a vegetable gratin \u2014 and an unlikely restaurant hit was born. Recipes completed, forks in. The chefs chew and nod, their eyebrows raised in approval.

It slices, it dices in teeny, tiny slices. It makes mounds of julienne fries in just seconds. Wouldn\u2019t you love to greet your friends at the door with lovely vegetables like these?\u201d I would say, indicating my brother and sister. (The tasteless double-entendre was always good for an extra laugh.) Anyone from my generation can probably recite the ads, which certainly worked on me. I pestered my mother until she ordered one. There was no question that the first thing I\u2019d put through the machine would be a tomato; Ron Popeil (or his stand-in) did it so effortlessly, spreading out pristine slices on the countertop like a Las Vegas deck of cards. After I unpacked and set up the device, I took a tomato, lined it up on the blades, placed my hand on the safety handle and pushed it down firmly, smashing the tomato \u2014 and my illusions. The fruit exploded, its juice and seeds splattering on every exposed surface of the kitchen, including the ceiling, walls and me. Nothing came through the blades except water, leaving behind a deflated disk of tomato skin and flesh. And so 40-some years later, I met with skepticism the e-mail referring to the Veg-O-Matic as \u201ca kitchen classic that makes chopping veggies a breeze.\u201d With the new and improved design, wrote the publicist, it takes just one stroke to slice and dice! After putting the machine through its paces ($19.99; Amazon.com), I have to wonder just what kind of stroke she meant.\n The Veg-O-Matic, introduced in the early 1960s, was invented by Samuel Popeil. His son, Ron, who created Ronco Corp. in 1958, catapulted sales of the Veg-O-Matic into the millions through direct-response TV ads. (Ronco has been bought and sold more than once; since 2011 it has been owned by CD3 Holdings Inc.) The machine\u2019s new design consists of two plastic grips to place on the safety handle and four separate blade attachments housed in round plastic casings: a cube blade for potatoes, a chopping blade for onions, a slicing blade for tomatoes and a wedge blade for apples. Teeth on the grips are supposed to push and extrude food. The entire housing looks like a plastic Arc de Triomphe, though triumph is a dubious outcome. This time I started with an onion. Pressing down on the handle firmly, as instructed, with the palms of my hands, I could not push the onion through the dicing disk. In fact, I had to bang on the handle with my fist several times, then pull off both the grip and blade and use a bamboo skewer to extract pieces stuck on both of them. A potato did not go through the cubing blade, even after I pounded on it with my fist. As I tried to pull the pieces out of the blade, I cut myself. I readily admit to user error. As it turns out, I did not have the top grip inserted correctly at first. The very brief directions don\u2019t explain clearly that you have to twist it until it snaps into place.   Once I fixed that, onions still did not go through the chopping blade completely, but they fared better with the cubing disk. With the grip set correctly, potatoes went through the cubing disk easily (with one stroke!), inducing me to julienne with abandon. When a friend dropped by, I actually greeted her at the door with mounds of julienne fries \u2014 a childhood dream fulfilled. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t I realized that passing horizontal batons through the cubing blade would yield even, 1 / \n 2 -inch cubes (the instructions don\u2019t mention that), so I cubed everything I had on hand. Soft foods, such as zucchini and mushrooms, cube easily, but when you whack down on the handle, chopped pieces go flying everywhere. Factor sweeping into your prep time. The wedge disk made short work of coring peeled apples and dividing them into eighths. Potatoes and onions also made nice wedges. Denser vegetables were trouble. Attempting to force a sweet potato through the blades for batons, I had to call my husband in for help. He placed both hands on the sides of the handle and pushed down over and over, as if trying to administer CPR. Carrots proved to be the machine\u2019s undoing. On the 10th fist blow to coerce them through the blades, one of the blade strips came off; it was barely heftier than heavy-duty aluminum foil. Good thing I had two machines on hand, so I could continue my dicing frenzy. But it wasn\u2019t long before the springs in the safety handle began to offer resistance and screech like an old screen door every time I pressed down. Once I managed to push the handle down, I then had to pry it back up, sometimes turning the device on its side to force the parts apart. I chalked the effort up to a cardio workout. Now it was time to face my demons and try to slice a tomato. Taking no chances, I decided to perform the exercise outdoors. One look at the \u201cnew and improved\u201d blade made me realize that proper slices were not possible. The revamped design lets you create half-moons at best, but not rounds. Keeping in mind my childhood experience, I made sure to use a firm tomato. Half of it went partially through the blades and had to be cut free; the other half was smushed on top. As a challenge, I set out to create dishes using my Veg-O-Matic-prepped foods. Wedges of potatoes, apples and onions fairly begged to be browned, roasted with a pork loin and finished with an apple jus. My pile of rough-chopped tomatoes (I used a knife) and cubed onions, carrots, celery, potatoes, mushrooms, zucchini and apples made a hearty fall soup when combined with chicken chorizo sausage to balance the sweetness of the apples. The simple fact is, though, that even if the Veg-O-Matic came with crucial missing accessories (a spouse, a bamboo skewer, a broom, Band-Aids), it would still be superfluous in today\u2019s well-outfitted kitchen, where a food processor, mandoline or good, old-fashioned knife skills will do a superior job. The original model of the Veg-O-Matic appears in the Smithsonian Museum, and I can\u2019t think of a better place for it. \n Hagedorn is co-author of \u201c My Irish Table: Recipes From the Homeland and Restaurant Eve \u201d (Ten Speed Press, March 2014).

It is used to distinguish the pan-Asian feeder from its competition. \u201cHome of the Chork,\u201d reads the slogan on the black T-shirts of the staff members animating the assembly line and kitchen brought to life by chef Dennis Friedman. Surely you know the drill. Scan the short menu above your head while you\u2019re in line; tell the smiling server behind the counter what dish (and what amount) you want freshly prepared from the display of vegetables, meats and other toppings; pay at the end of the line, then wait for the pager you\u2019re given to light up, announcing that lunch or dinner is ready. Your Chork is best applied to Fuzu, a made-up name for a toss of rice noodles, carrots, scallops, shrimp, fried shallots and more that\u2019s one of the most popular plates at Newton\u2019s Table. Newton\u2019s Noodles offers Fuzu two ways: original soy (\u201csalty and sweet with a touch of heat,\u201d goes the mantra) and \u201ccoco-curry,\u201d with peanuts, cilantro and a creamier sauce. My preference is for the tried-and-true original, served, as are all dishes here, in Chinese takeout cartons. The original recipe, zesty with ginger and garlic, resembles a showy pad Thai; the new dish turns sodden fast. Appetizers, or \u201capps,\u201d as the menu bills them, are served in three portions: starter, entree and family size. A few of the wan tuna bites, offered with a muted mustard vinaigrette, and the cornstarch-dusted chicken nuggets, crisp but dull, proved plenty for me. Chilled soba noodles tossed with a choice of three vegetables (Yes! Asparagus!) is the lightest of the lot, although the dish\u2019s supposedly \u201ctangy\u201d dressing tasted as though it had been seasoned by a pastry chef. In its first month, too much of this food tastes like Asian carryout \u2014 from last night. Pale green walls and blond wood dividers lend a pleasing California air to the 70-seat interior; the thumping background music, on the other hand, encourages customers to speed up the movement of their Chorks and beat it. Friedman is dreaming large. The entrepreneur\u2019s expansion plans include outlets in Maryland and Virginia, possibly even New York. Here\u2019s one customer who hopes he uses his noodle, slows down and smooths out the wrinkles before multiplying. \n 1129 20th St. NW. 202-827-3907. www.newtonsnoodles.com .

The rest continue to work in various capacities at Clyde\u2019s of Gallery Place, he said, as the restaurant group cooperates with the Department of Homeland Security agency to update documents to prove the employees are authorized to work.  The restaurant employs a total of more than 200 people at its 23,000-square-foot Gallery Place location, ranking it among the largest restaurants in the District (although still smaller than the Hamilton , the 37,000-square-foot operation on 14th Street NW, which the Clyde\u2019s Restaurant Group also owns). \u201cThey don\u2019t want us to close down the entire restaurant\u201d in Gallery Place, Andersen said about ICE. The situation has created angst on both sides of the business. On Thursday, those 100-plus employees showed up at the D.C. Mayor\u2019s Office on Latino Affairs, looking for someone who could help them keep their jobs or just remain in the United States, said director Roxana Olivas. Some were scared, Olivas said. Many were confused on what exactly was expected of them. On the flip side, Clyde\u2019s of Gallery Place is operating without a sizable fraction of its employees who worked in all facets of the restaurant, including bussers, servers and cooks, Andersen said. The location has not cut back its operating hours, but some workers have been pulling double shifts while others are accepting more hours. Clyde\u2019s also has been hiring new employees to replace the ones who left as a result of the ICE audit, Andersen said. Arturo Griffiths, day labor organizer for D.C. Jobs With Justice , which is assisting the affected workers, said he has encountered situations similar to the one at Clyde\u2019s: Employers that don\u2019t want to keep paying the higher wages of experienced workers will provide an anonymous tip to ICE, which will then conduct an audit of employees\u2019 work-authorization documents. A number of the affected Clyde\u2019s employees, Griffiths said, have worked at the restaurant for more than five years. \u201cSometimes places clean up and fire the ones that are there\u201d for long periods, Griffiths said. \u201cSometimes the companies use ICE to do this cleaning, which is a very comfortable way to do it.\u201d Griffiths said the employees still working at Clyde\u2019s have seen new, potentially illegal workers join the staff in the aftermath of the ICE audit. Andersen, the corporate operations manager, said Griffiths\u2019s charge was without merit. \u201cFor somebody to say this is inflammatory and probably serves his purpose,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cI have a great love for these people who have worked so hard.\u201d   What\u2019s more, Andersen said that because of the audit the company has been cautious about new hires. The restaurant group is working with D.C. Central Kitchen , the D.C. Department of Employment Services and the Carlos Rosario International Public Charter School to find employees with the proper authorizations to work. Clyde\u2019s has \u201cabsolutely not\u201d hired any illegal workers as replacements, he said. \u201cNot to our knowledge.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t As of Friday afternoon, Clyde\u2019s had not issued a deadline for the employees to submit their new documentation or face termination, Andersen said. ICE had originally set an Oct. 7 deadline for Clyde\u2019s to file new documents, but that has been extended indefinitely as the restaurant group works with the government on the audit, Andersen said. Eventually, the executive added, Clyde\u2019s would have to set a cutoff date. Clyde\u2019s has made attorneys available for those affected employees who \u201cneed help in any way,\u201d Andersen said. Those consultations, he added, are not shared with the company. As a matter of policy ICE does not confirm or deny \u201cthe existence or accuracy of audits or investigations,\u201d said Gillian M. Christensen, deputy press secretary for ICE. The agency does not conduct random audits, Christensen added \u2014 only audits based on tips or other investigative leads. Generally speaking, ICE focuses its attention on employers, not employees, during audits. The exception would be workers who are convicted criminals; ICE might take action against those employees. Andersen said there have been \u201cno threats of penalty\u201d yet for Clyde\u2019s. Despite their differing perspectives on the Clyde\u2019s audit and its effect on employees, both Griffiths and Andersen agree on one thing: The government appears to be in crackdown mode. Both men independently said they had heard ICE audits are being carried out at a number of businesses in the District. \u201cThis is happening around town,\u201d Griffiths said, \u201cand this is happening in many parts that we don\u2019t even know about.\u201d Their opinions jibe with a September article in the Wall Street Journal , which reported that the government notified \u201cabout 1,000 businesses across the country in recent weeks\u201d that they must submit documents for audits.

When it emerged from renovation about a month later, the ground-floor dining attraction in the W Hotel looked just as its new general manager hoped it would: \u201cmore playful and energetic.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t John Leinhardt\u2019s words certainly apply to the enormous suspended lanterns and the shocking red vinyl seats that push into broad walnut tables. A wall in the rear is dominated by an abstract photograph of the Capitol dome that reminds you you\u2019re not far from the real deal just up the road. Adding to the fizz in the redesign is a small bar with seven seats and a couple of tall communal tables, where light bites \u2014 a lobster roll, beef sliders \u2014 can be washed back with such fresh cocktails as a Manhattan made marvelous with tawny port and walnut bitters.  The time off has been good for the interior, which, like recent comers on the market sidesteps the traditional manly imprint. The menu, in contrast, reads like a throwback to the days when hotel restaurants played it safe as comfort zones for guests who didn\u2019t want to be challenged at mealtime. Shrimp cocktail, anyone? Beef carpaccio? An appetizer of minced yellowfin tuna tartare layered between harsh preserved lemon and rich avocado is also overwhelmed by a thin cover of deep-fried quinoa. Philippe Reininger, 53 and an acolyte of the acclaimed Jean-Georges Vongerichten in New York, is a talented chef. But a diner doesn\u2019t always taste his skills in J&G\u2019s new (yet predictable) fall menu. With notable exceptions, the recent additions hover in the realm of ... pleasant. Take the fritters that crack open to cores of truffled cheese. What\u2019s not to like about something fried and hot and gooey? Picture a cross between mozzarella sticks and gougeres. On the lighter side is a salad of roasted squash and curly frisee with pinches of goat cheese; the mix gets a nice jolt from a pumpkinseed vinaigrette. And the kitchen has fun with clam chowder, a pond of hot cream adrift with crisp \u201cwaves\u201d of garlic chips. One of the dishes that used to draw me to this restaurant, even off-duty, was Reininger\u2019s halibut set on a racy base of black beans and chilies and crowned with cool chopped celery. I know chefs can\u2019t keep everyone\u2019s favorites forever, but I\u2019m surprised this stellar signature was dropped, especially given the fish entrees that have taken its place. Steamed rockfish under a carpet of shaved mushrooms is best for the intense mushroom dashi in its bowl. Pan-fried lobster with sauteed cabbage, on the other hand, is totally forgettable, its accents of ginger and mint vague. For the most part, meat is what you want to slice at J&G. \u201cSix peppercorn\u201d New York steak tastes like truth in advertising, each bite a trumpet blast of heat; the bone-in rib-eye is 20 ounces of indulgence for $54. The (mostly prime) steaks show off good shopping, and any cut is better with a dab of the house-made condiments cleverly served in ramekins that look like hollowed beef bones. New to the lineup is a pork porterhouse, blushing and thick and dense; its assets include a citrusy barbecue glaze and bright green broccoli rabe.   The side dish options include basil-brightened creamed spinach, good-not-great french fries and leeks roasted to softness beneath a red spread of romesco. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t I\u2019ve saved the best entree for last. Beef short ribs are the workhorse of many American restaurants, and you may think they\u2019re all cut from the same cow. Not true! Reininger\u2019s version \u2014 glossy and tender and reverberating with lemon grass and red chilies \u2014 is an upgrade from just about any class you\u2019re coming from, thanks also to toasty, rosemary-laced panko and matchsticks of green apple crowning the meat. If you try only one dish at J&G, make it this one.  Those who pass on wine and spirits should consider the house-made sodas, which come in such appealing flavors as fresh ginger and spiced cranberry. The pastry kitchen makes a cheesecake light enough, and luscious enough, to finish even after a full steak dinner. The ivory slice is set off with lovely contrasts of diced apples on top and shimmering riesling gelee on the plate, plus a scoop of slightly chewy pumpkin-spiced ice cream. Another sweet success is the huckleberry pie, a big round of baked fruit festooned with pear chips and delivered in a skillet with hazelnut gelato. Watch for flying spoons. The big dessert curiosity is a single, bun-size profiterole filled with banana ice cream. The whopper looks as if it ran away from a chain restaurant. Indeed, after tasting the outsize confection, a companion speaks for the table when he says, \u201cIt looks like somebody did a stage [apprenticeship] at the Cheesecake Factory.\u201d \n\n Beyond the menu, a few adjustments would make this a better place to spend a couple of hours. The tinny club music \u2014 \u201ccheap EDM,\u201d a fellow diner knocks it \u2014 is out of tune with the setting. A bar cart rolls up to get dinner off to a festive start, and some of us are ready to pounce \u2014 until we\u2019re told that the presentation extends only to martinis. Some servers are the sort the competition would love to poach, while others, such as the one who mentioned a dish was \u201c86\u2019d,\u201d could use more rehearsal time. \n\n\n The goal of a makeover is to refresh its subject. The designer got the message here; the kitchen appears to have missed it.            \n \n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2605\n\u2605\n \n (Good) \n \n J&G Steakhouse \n 515 15th St. NW. 202-661-2440. jgsteakhousedc. com. \n\n OPEN: Breakfast 7 to 10:30 a.m. Monday through Friday, 8 to 11 a.m. Saturday and Sunday; lunch 11:45 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday, noon to 3:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; dinner 5 to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 5 to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. \n\n METRO: \n Metro Center. \n\n PRICES: Dinner appetizers $10 to $18, main courses $18 to $56. \n\n SOUND CHECK: \n 79 decibels/Must speak with raised voice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Dinner and a show \n A reservation in the dining room helps you join the \u201cskip\u201d line that cuts the wait for an elevator ride to the rooftop bar and its views.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "food"], "author": "Tom Sietsema", "wordCount": 1051}, {"date": "2013-10-23 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Chat Leftovers: Butter for cookies", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636606/s/32cff59b/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cfood0Cchat0Eleftovers0C20A130C10A0C220Cf40Af110Ae0E3b580E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ifood/story01.htm", "text": "Are you a millennial?

When we run out of time, it\u2018s my job to answer a leftover question. So here\u2019s one from last week\u2019s chat : \n\n Most cookie recipes that call for butter specify that it be softened, cold, etc. If a recipe doesn\u2019t specify, what is the best/most neutral option? I\u2019ve gone with out-of-the-fridge-but-not-yet-soft, but is there a better approach? \n\n Thank you for that question, because it gave me a chance to catch up with Nancy Baggett, local cookbook author and cookie baker extraordinaire. I knew she\u2019d have the right answer; we\u2019ve featured more than 50 of her recipes in our Recipe Finder database over the years, and they\u2019re always foolproof. So: What to do with your cookie butter? \u201cIt depends on what the next step is,\u201d Nancy says. \u201cThat should clue you in as to what you need to do.\u201d For example, \u201cIf it says to beat the butter with the sugar, right off that\u2019s going to tell you something. That won\u2019t work if the butter is still cold. .\u2009.\u2009. You need to have the butter softened some. If you\u2019re using a very weak hand mixer, the cold butter could actually bend or break the blades or jam the machine.\u201d Even a sturdy stand mixer, she says, could have difficulty processing chilled butter. You don\u2019t want a heavy machine jumping around on your countertop. \u201cThe other clue is if it says to cut the butter into the sugar or, more likely, into the flour. In that case, the butter should be cold. You can\u2019t cut warm butter successfully into pieces. You\u2019ll just mash it around.\u201d The bottom line: \u201cTake a clue from the recipe itself. Normally, if it doesn\u2019t say at all what to do, I would go for slightly softened, but that presupposes that you aren\u2019t going to cut the butter in.\u201d She also says, \u201cObviously, the recipe writer should tell you!\u201d Clearly! Here\u2019s a half-dozen of Nancy\u2019s cookie recipes from our database. We promise that they all tell you how cold the butter should be \u2014 unless you\u2019re supposed to melt it, in which case it doesn\u2019t matter one bit how it starts out. \n\n Rosemary-Orange Shortbread Cookies \n\n \n\n Quick No-Bake S\u2019mores Bars \n\n \n\n Orange-Ginger Creams (these are great even without the buttercream filling) \n\n Iced Cranberry-White Drop Cookies \n\n \n\n Key Lime Sugar Cookies \n\n \n\n Sherill\u2019s Secret Soft Gingerbread Boys", "topics": ["lifestyle", "food"], "author": "Jane Touzalin", "wordCount": 540}, {"date": "2013-10-22 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Weeknight Vegetarian: Bowl win", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636606/s/32c700c3/sc/26/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cfood0Cweeknight0Evegetarian0Ebowl0Ewin0C20A130C10A0C210C16a1ed7e0E38230E11e30Eae460Ee4248e75c8ea0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ifood/story01.htm", "text": "When I was in college in the 1980s, one of my go-to meals was a bowl of beans and rice, topped with cheddar and salsa. Cheap, filling and nutritious, especially once I learned to go easy on the cheddar and rice and heavy on the beans and salsa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Nowadays, like many vegetarian cooks, I keep some sort of grain \u201cbowl\u201d in my regular rotation. The grains have gotten far more interesting than rice: There\u2019s farro, millet, barley and more. Noodles count, because it\u2019s ever-easier to find them in whole-grain varieties. After that, the vegetables can change with the seasons, the toppings can include any number of sauces and dressings, and the protein sources can include beans and nuts and cheeses. Best of all, you can pre-cook most, if not all, of the elements. Isa Chandra Moskowitz is a grain bowl fan, too. Co-author of one of the most comprehensive cookbooks on vegan cooking, 2007\u2019s \u201c Veganomicon ,\u201d Moskowitz has a new book out, \u201cIsa Does It,\u201d that might bring even more of her Post-Punk Kitchen personality to the table. In it, she devotes a chapter to such dishes. \u201cMy idea of a heavenly dinner is a large bowl of grains, veggies, a little protein, and a killer sauce,\u201d she writes. Among them, there\u2019s a bowl of soba noodles topped with roasted cauliflower, lentils and miso-tahini dressing. There\u2019s a bowl of brown rice topped with pan-fried tofu, kale and a peanut sauce. And there\u2019s my current favorite, Chimichurri-Pumpkin Bowl: buckwheat noodles topped with roasted pumpkin, a tart green sauce \u2014 and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, black beans.

The 39-year-old song\u00adwriter co-wrote Miranda Lambert\u2019s punchy \u201c Mama\u2019s Broken Heart \u201d and Kacey Musgraves\u2019s paralyzing \u201c Merry Go \u2019Round ,\u201d making him the only guy on the block with two nominations for song of the year. This stretch of Music Row \u2014 a storied songwriting salt mine that looks like any old leafy residential boulevard in town \u2014 is quiet on Sunday afternoon. But this neighborhood is still entrenched in a conflict that\u2019s been raging for generations \u2014 the war between real country music and the commercial stuff. McAnally\u2019s songs are brilliantly, unabashedly both. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a commercial-minded songwriter. I\u2019m here to make a living and be on the radio. But radio is still really dominated by something else,\u201d he says. \u201cI just think there\u2019s more. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019d like for the top 20 songs to not only be that .\u201d He\u2019s talking about the feel-great party anthems that have dominated the charts this year \u2014 songs where the beers are always frosty, the trucks are always muddy, everyone is 19 and the singer is always a dude. McAnally isn\u2019t trying to shut down the party with his ballads about longing, vulnerability and bad-idea booty calls \u2014 he just wants to coexist. And having co-written seven No. 1 country singles in the past three years, he is. He didn\u2019t do it alone. Rising alongside a tight clique of co-writers \u2014 including Brandy Clark, who released her stunning solo debut last month \u2014 McAnally has helped write monster hits ( Lady Antebellum \u2019s \u201c Downtown ,\u201d the Band Perry \u2019s \u201c Better Dig Two \u201d) and superlative sleeper cuts ( Ashley Monroe \u2019s \u201c Two Weeks Late ,\u201d Randy Rogers Band \u2019s \u201c Fuzzy \u201d) \u2014 all very different songs with varying degrees of bittersweetness. \u201cThat internal ache is the starting point of country music,\u201d McAnally says. \u201cIf it\u2019s a happy song and I can still feel sad in it? That\u2019s my favorite. Pop does that a lot right now. Both of Miley Cyrus\u2019s singles, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d and \u201cWrecking Ball.\u201d [Katy Perry\u2019s] \u201cTeenage Dream.\u201d .\u2009.\u2009. Those songs are sad to me, even though they\u2019re, like, UNGH-UNGH-UNGH!\u201d (He pumps his fist overhead like Arsenio Hall.) McAnally is sharp-witted, shrewd, smart. Just the right amount of cocky. He\u2019s also gay and out, but feels that the reductive \u201cgay country songwriter\u201d tag that\u2019s been pinned to his lapel says more about the media\u2019s perception of Nashville than it does about him. After a New York Times headline declared that McAnally was \u201cOut and Riding High in Nashville\u201d in May, a young, gay songwriter told McAnally he\u2019d never dreamed of coming out in this town.   \u201cAnd I told him, \u2018Great. Now you\u2019re here and the only thing you can do is out-write everybody else,\u2019\u2009\u201d McAnally says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t McAnally grew up in Mineral Wells, Tex., and spent his childhood devouring country radio and MTV. \u201cI always loved the shiniest, most popular thing,\u201d McAnally says. \u201cI always loved Willie Nelson, but I loved the songs that Willie made famous.\u201d He came to Nashville in 1994 with dreams of superstardom, but after his 2000 debut album went thud, he moved to Los Angeles and eventually boomeranged back to the country music capital in 2007, out and ready to write. Nashville felt claustrophobic his first time around. Not anymore. \u201cWhen I lived here in \u201994, I wasn\u2019t even out to me, and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to figure that out here, being a country music singer,\u201d McAnally says. \u201cNow, things are different. But maybe I\u2019m different. I don\u2019t know why I was so closeted. I grew up in a small town in Texas. I had the hangover from that. It wasn\u2019t Nashville. I haven\u2019t felt anything but accepted here. And the success helps. Because what are they gonna say?\u201d That success came quickly, in country music years. No other form of pop has a slower metabolism \u2014 and McAnally\u2019s fast-but-slow ascent is strong evidence of that. He says it takes roughly two years for a song to travel from his guitar to the radio. During that time, publishers shop the song around town. An artist puts it on layaway. Maybe they get around to recording it. Or maybe they bail and the process starts over. The music moves slowly and change can feel glacial. But it\u2019s happening. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d McAnally says of country music\u2019s future. \u201cHow could I complain? I have had so much critical praise with what I\u2019ve worked on. I\u2019ve gotten on the radio, and so many people that get critical praise don\u2019t.\u201d The biggest hurdle McAnally faces now is his own happiness. He and his husband \u2014 the two got married in Mexico in September 2012 \u2014 are busy raising their two young children, a daughter and a son. Last year, he was writing a staggering eight songs every week, meaning those plaques will keep showing up at the office. Life\u2019s brooding dramas feel very far away. \u201cI have a hard time being happy, and I think a lot of creative people suffer with that when life gets real happy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m affected by things that are really sad and I\u2019m just not very sad right now. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m a creative person who had a lot of dark time in my life. I can still get to it, I can still go to a relationship or a time when things weren\u2019t great. But it\u2019s getting further and further from me. So what choice should I make? I really like being happy.\u201d Maybe he could try transposing all that domestic bliss into melody? \u201cWrite a song about my kids right now?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019d rather just hang out with them.\u201d \n In Wednesday\u2019s Washington Post: Brandy Clark is one of country music\u2019s most talked-about new artists.

Mathangi \u201cMaya\u201d Arulpragasam, 38, has similarly turned cultural sedition into immense success. The daughter of a revolutionary displaced by the Sri Lankan civil war has her own Versace line. Her young son is a scion to the Seagram\u2019s liquor fortune.  Eminem may shout out his underground bona fides on the new album\u2019s \u201cLegacy,\u201d but he\u2019s as responsible as anyone for the mainstreaming of hip-hop. The first \u201c Marshall Mathers LP \u201d transcended genre. It was wincingly profane, emotionally unnerving and captured the millennial zeitgeist. As Eminem put it: The underground spun around and did a 360. You could use the same phrase to describe M.I.A. flipping off 111 million viewers during the 2012 Super Bowl halftime show . The act earned her a $1.5 million lawsuit from the NFL. A response comes on \u201cMatangi\u2019s\u201d \u201cBoom Skit,\u201d in which she assails those angry that she tried to \u201csteal Madonna\u2019s crown.\u201d Her politics are muddled, but the message is clear: neither truffle fries nor television time mitigate her desire to savage those \u201cwho don\u2019t get our underground.\u201d Eminem\u2019s definition of \u201cunderground\u201d specifically referred to a schism in hip-hop culture; M.I.A.\u2019s encompasses the global disenfranchised. The first \u201c Marshall Mathers LP \u201d became a touchstone because Eminem spoke for the millions who dressed, walked and talked like him. \u201cMatangi\u201d implicitly reproaches that same fair-haired, light-eyed majority \u2014 or anyone reaping the dividends of economic inequality. While their creative differences might be stark, both spend much of their latest records exploring what\u2019s left to rebel against. M.I.A.\u2019s fourth album is a dialectic disguised as a dance party. In interviews given last year, she blamed delays on record label executives dismayed at her shift towards positivity. Still, there\u2019s plenty of vitriol aimed at multinational oligarchs, government surveillance and those \u201cwhose guns point the wrong way.\u201d \u201cATENTion\u201d spotlights the plight of dispossessed refugees, complete with an uncredited writing assist from WikiLeaks founder and M.I.A. comrade Julian Assange. There\u2019s \u201cBring the Noize,\u201d which takes its name from Public Enemy, and rants against banks, bad tattoos and how she\u2019s the \u201coverweight, heavyweight, female Slick Rick.\u201d But \u201cMatangi\u201d also doubles as an exploration of metaphysical and carnal concerns. Its title comes from the Hindu tantric goddess of speech, music and knowledge. There are two songs with the lecherous crooner the Weeknd . The opener is \u201cKarmaggedon,\u201d which reconciles her sky-is-falling past with a nascent desire for inner peace.   Even at her most mellow, M.I.A. remains a pop subversive. Whether you buy into the quasi-revolutionary rhetoric or not, she resists initiation into the realm of top 40 clich\u00e9. There are no melodramatic ballads, cynical radio grabs or cameos from the hot rapper du jour. \u201cMatangi\u201d is a pan-global, post-Internet tantrum of bhangra beats, hip-hop, Bollywood music, dancehall, EDM and the occasional jazz harp. While it can get tedious, it finds M.I.A. refining her sound and self-identity. It\u2019s engaging but still keeps you at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s club music for those who can\u2019t countenance (or afford) the bottle-service scam. The influences are acknowledged without nostalgia. What\u2019s left to rebel against is converted into a multimedia art experiment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Eminem\u2019s aims are comparatively vague. \u201cI\u2019m all out of Backstreet Boys to attack,\u201d he laments on \u201cEvil Twin,\u201d a rare highlight from \u201cMMLP2.\u201d The semi-sequel finds him at a crossroads, scanning the horizon of broken-up boy bands and faded pop stars he once reviled. \u201cWho\u2019s left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber? Nah,\u201d he continues.  It\u2019s an honest admission that the war is over. Yet much of the album ironically finds him lobbing stale and dated pop culture salvos towards a world where CNN brings next-day analysis of Miley Cyrus twerking. He\u2019s the last one making jokes about Kevin Federline, Lorena Bobbitt and O.J. Simpson. On the first \u201cMarshall Mathers LP,\u201d Eminem used his whiteness to incisively examine deeper racial hypocrisies. Its successor finds him adrift in a world where the other most popular white rapper advocates for same-sex marriage and grandpa sweaters. The same homophobic slurs, mommy issues and violent threats toward women remain. But whereas Eminem once used them in service of jokes and cohesive narratives, he now uses them as a trigger for nostalgia. The Rick Rubin-produced lead single \u201cBerzerk\u201d intimated that \u201cMMLP2\u201d would be Eminem\u2019s throwback album, but Rubin\u2019s contributions seem to mostly comprise exhuming old Zombies and Joe Walsh loops over which Eminem can express his confusion about Facebook and Internet downloading. Eminem\u2019s syllable manipulation and rhyming agility remain staggering. But success has validated his worst musical decisions and Sam\u2019s Club tastes. Kendrick Lamar is the album\u2019s lone hip-hop guest, and the dream collaboration is squandered on awkward sex jokes on \u201cLove Game.\u201d The beat for \u201cRap God\u201d sounds made for a rave in a straight-to-DVD vampire movie. If \u201cSurvival\u201d feels made to cross-promote a video game for hyper-violent adolescents, that\u2019s because it was (\u201cCall of Duty: Ghosts\u201d). The album opens with a seven-minute plus sequel to \u201cStan\u201d; it replaces the original\u2019s psychological unraveling with sub-\u201cSaw\u201d schlock. Nate Ruess of fun., Skyler Gray and Rihanna pop up elsewhere to belt Eminem\u2019s hokey, group-therapy choruses. The Dr. Dre beats are gone, substituted with monotonous martial drums and squealing rock-rap guitars for the Nickelback demographic. Since \u201cLose Yourself,\u201d Eminem has increasingly incorporated atonal, nasally hooks and grumpy-dad growls. But they lack build and pacing \u2014 crescendos come as randomly as a mad dog barking at a ghost. He mistakes architectural complexity for advancement. The raps are technical metal guitar solos that go nowhere. The flows are dazzling but lack the elasticity and playful wit of Eminem\u2019s early brilliance. \n\n Albert Camus described a rebel as a \u201cman who says no.\u201d \u201cMMLP2\u201d is the sound of Eminem saying yes. In 2000, he was the monster. In 2013, he\u2019s \u201cfriends with the monsters under his bed.\u201d Marshall Mathers may still command a nation of millions, but he\u2019s lost the ability to see their faces. \n Weiss is a freelance writer.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Jeff Weiss", "wordCount": 1073}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Bobby Parker, influential blues singer-guitarist and showman", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/334c85ae/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cbobby0Eparker0Einfluential0Eblues0Esinger0Eguitarist0Eand0Eshowman0C20A130C110C0A40C0Aa8986180E435f0E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "Bobby Parker, a soul-blues singer and guitarist whose recordings from the late 1950s and 1960s \u2014 notably the propulsive groove of \u201cWatch Your Step\u201d \u2014 influenced performers as varied as John Lennon, Carlos Santana and the band Led Zeppelin, died Oct. 31 at an emergency care facility in Bowie, Md. He was 76 and lived in Temple Hills, Md. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Omar Ashaka.  \nThe Washington-based bluesman cut a swaggering figure on stage with his preacher-like exhortations to \u201csay yeah, children,\u201d his shiny suits and his lacquered, James Brown-style hairdo. His tenor voice both caressed and screamed the blues over his powerful, stinging \u2014 and sometimes over-amped \u2014 lead guitar. And he loved to walk the bar or walk through the crowd as he worked the strings. Reviewing a 1993 nightclub performance, music critic Peter Watrous of the New York Times wrote that Mr. Parker would \u201cplay beautifully formed blues ideas, then throw in be-bop lines worthy of George Benson. .\u2009.\u2009. Though slightly ruffled by distortion, his notes, pearly and fat, skip along to their own undulating rhythms. And his singing, a high tenor moan, conveys more musical authority than emotional weight. .\u2009.\u2009. He was showing off his virtuosity there, as well.\u201d A veteran of the \u201cchitlin\u2019 circuit\u201d of black theaters, Mr. Parker wrote two much-covered hit recordings on the rhythm-and-blues charts, \u201c Blues Get Off My Shoulder \u201d (1958), a somber blues ballad enlivened by his trenchant guitar work, and \u201cWatch Your Step\u201d (1961). \u201c Watch Your Step ,\u201d recorded at Edgewood Studios at 16th and K Streets for V-Tone records, was a hit in the United States and England. The song\u2019s insistent riff, which Mr. Parker said evolved from the Afro-Cuban jazz composition \u201c Manteca ,\u201d caught on with the mod subculture in London. Jefferson Airplane, Santana and the Spencer Davis Group (with singer Steve Winwood) all covered the song. Its guitar motif was reprised in Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201c Moby Dick \u201d and the 1962 instrumental \u201c The Black Widow \u201d by fellow Washington guitarist Link Wray . The influence of \u201cWatch Your Step\u201d extended to John Lennon of The Beatles, who acknowledged in a 1974 radio interview that \u201c Day Tripper \u201d and \u201c I Feel Fine \u201d were attempts to write songs built on variations of the \u201cWatch Your Step\u201d riff. (Mr. Parker\u2019s record had been released in Germany while the Fab Four were paying their dues at Hamburg\u2019s Star-Club.) However, Mr. Parker reaped few rewards from the song\u2019s success. He sold the copyright to V-Tone records owner Ivan Mogull for a pittance in the early 1970s. \u201cI didn\u2019t do my homework when it came to [copyright] protections,\u201d he later told The Washington Post. \u201cWe just cut songs. And all of them got away from me.\u201d Mr. Parker\u2019s career was dogged by bad business decisions. During a Led Zeppelin tour that came through the Washington area in the early 1970s, band guitarist Jimmy Page sat in with Mr. Parker at the Bolling Air Force NCO club. The band, then searching for acts for their Swan Song record label, loaned him money for a tape recorder. However, Mr. Parker \u2014 perhaps fearful after having sold a major copyright away \u2014 never turned in the demo tape.   In the 1990s, Mr. Parker returned to the national limelight with two critically acclaimed CDs for the New Orleans label Black Top records, \u201cBent Out Of Shape\u201d (1993) and \u201cShine Me Up\u201d (1995), and later toured with Carlos Santana. A concert appearance with Santana at Switzerland\u2019s 2004 Montreux Jazz Festival was later released on DVD as \u201cCarlos Santana Presents Blues At Montreux.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cBobby Parker is a musician of the same caliber as Albert King and Albert Collins,\u201d Santana told Guitar Player magazine in 1996. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the few remaining guitarists on this planet who can pierce your heart and soothe your soul.\u201d  Robert Lee Parker was born Aug. 31, 1937, in Lafayette, La., and raised in Los Angeles. His mother sang in a gospel group, and his father was a distributor of jukebox records. A complete list of survivors could not be confirmed. In his teens, Mr. Parker left home to tour as guitarist for the doo-wop group Otis Williams and the Charms . He played guitar behind Bo Diddley on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in 1955 . Later, he toured and recorded as vocalist and guitarist in the band of Detroit saxophonist Paul \u201cHucklebuck\u201d Williams, where he replaced his idol, singer Little Willie John . The Williams unit served as a backup band at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and on several touring rock-and-roll package shows where Mr. Parker backed luminaries such as Sam Cooke and Fats Domino, often doubling on lead guitar or bass guitar as needed. Mr. Parker settled in Washington, where he led his own band throughout the early 1960s. His regular local engagements included the Tip Top Club in Bladensburg and the Flamingo Club in the District. In 1969, Mike Vernon, producer of the British blues band Fleetwood Mac, brought Mr. Parker to England at the height of the psychedelic era. The tour troubled Mr. Parker. \u201cThey wanted me to act like [Jimi] Hendrix, and I was a traditional bluesman,\u201d he later told The Post. \u201cIt was a disappointment that everybody was channeled that way and not perceptive to other things. \u201cI had two nice little guitars and they wanted me to break them up\u201d like Hendrix, he recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Man, I\u2019m not breaking up my guitars.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Terence McArdle", "wordCount": 890}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Washington Chorus celebrates Britten with strong \u2018War Requiem\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/334a9081/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cwashington0Echorus0Ecelebrates0Ebritten0Ewith0Estrong0Ewar0Erequiem0C20A130C110C0A40C5532ab3a0E45720E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "It may be a fool\u2019s errand to pick \u201cfavorites\u201d in any art form, but the three composers who have anniversaries this year \u2014 Verdi , Wagner and Benjamin Britten \u2014 may be mine. To the general public, Britten, who would have been 100 this month, needs more special pleading than the other two, both born a century before him. He seems generally underappreciated, despite the fact that he knows how to write for the voice; he knows how to write for instruments; and there are a lot of stunning pieces in his oeuvre. I\u2019ve often written about how much I love his work. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t And to many people, even those who aren\u2019t particular Britten fans, his \u201cWar Requiem\u201d \u2014 which the Washington Chorus gave at the Kennedy Center in a strong and moving performance Sunday night \u2014 is one of his masterpieces. To me, it represents a stumbling block.  I don\u2019t want to let personal bias pollute my account of a powerful evening. \u201cWar Requiem\u201d is a big piece, with full orchestra and chamber orchestra (drawn heavily from the National Symphony Orchestra\u2019s ranks), full chorus, three vocal soloists and a children\u2019s chorus and organ (the Washington Children\u2019s Chorus was enthroned in a balcony at the back of the hall, the singers\u2019 voices radiating down over the audience like boisterous angels). When the piece came to its aching conclusion and Julian Wachner, the chorus\u2019s director, put down his arms, the hall was wrapped in a sustained silence. It seemed to me less the silence of people trying to be properly rapt and more the silence of people who needed to finish digesting what they\u2019d heard before descending to the level of applause. Wachner is midway through a festival of all of Britten\u2019s nonoperatic work this fall at New York\u2019s Trinity Church, his other artistic home, so Britten at this point is home turf. Wachner led fluidly, linking all the disparate parts into a kind of homogenous whole: There was not a lot of contrast between the chamber-orchestra sections, which accompany the male vocal soloists singing poems by Wilfred Owen, and the full-orchestra sections during which the chorus and soprano sing the Latin text of the standard Requiem Mass. The orchestra surged up around the soloists, particularly the soprano, Jessica Muirhead: The decision to cast this part with a lighter voice paid off at moments, like the \u201cLacrimosa,\u201d but made some rough going for her in the \u201cLiber scriptus.\u201d The soprano in this piece also has a tougher job in that she represents a faceless female voice, as opposed to the precise characterizations of the Owen poems sung by the men. The baritone Christopher Burchett was perfectly capable without being incisive \u2014 in, for example, the opening of the poem in the Offertorium, \u201cSo Abram rose,\u201d which lacked the vivid emphasis the passage seems to call for. The standout was the tenor, Vale Rideout, who joined emotional expression with intense singing. Although you might say the beautifully prepared children\u2019s chorus was the standout, since it literally stood so far apart from the rest of the proceedings. And the Washington Chorus itself offered a warm, textured sound, dwindling to a bare hum at some of the iterations of \u201crequiem,\u201d grant them peace. Wachner could have been more incisive in his conducting and helped bring out the soloists more, but what he offered was on a level that showed once again that he is a full-blown conductor who happens to conduct choruses, rather than that tricky appellation, a \u201cchoral conductor.\u201d That he didn\u2019t wholly convert me is no one\u2019s fault but my own. Often, a review can serve as a way for a critic to advance her argument about a piece, but I don\u2019t especially want to advance my feelings about \u201cWar Requiem\u201d; I wish I liked it more than I do. It is full of beautiful moments, and I am always surprised, returning to it, to remember how well I know it. But as an experience, it always seems fragmentary, filled with bits that remind me happily of other Britten moments I love \u2014 skittering horns, children singing in headlong chant, a phrase emerging from one of the poems in the baritone\u2019s firm voice. Personal tastes are essential to a critic\u2019s job, but it\u2019s unfortunate when they keep one from joining in, for example, Sunday\u2019s enthusiastic, and deserved, applause. \n The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra will also perform \u201cWar Requiem\u201d on Nov. 14 and 15 in Baltimore and on Nov. 16 at Strathmore.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Anne Midgette", "wordCount": 745}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Dance to the new M.I.A. album before you can buy it", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/334b143a/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cgoing0Eout0Egurus0Cpost0Cdance0Eto0Ethe0Enew0Emia0Ealbum0Ebefore0Eyou0Ecan0Ebuy0Eit0C20A130C110C0A40C153efedc0E45880E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Fritz Hahn", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "American Music Festival opens with Ives\u2019s and Copland\u2019s competing visions of America", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/334a8bc6/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Creview0Enational0Egallerys0E65th0Eamerican0Emusic0Efestival0C20A130C110C0A40C278ca0A940E456a0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "The opening concert of a music festival is a statement of intent. It sets the tone, defines parameters and suggests avenues for exploration. The National Gallery\u2019s 65th American Music Festival opened Sunday night with a fascinating program dedicated to Charles Ives and Aaron Copland. In its ambition and scope, the concert offered nothing less than two competing musical visions of America itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The evening featured the Maryland Sinfonietta, a student chamber orchestra from the University of Maryland, led by Michael Jacko. If musical standards and ensemble values were not always upheld, the ideas provoked by the programming were illuminating. The juxtaposition of Ives\u2019s \u201cThree Places in New England\u201d and Copland\u2019s \u201cAppalachian Spring\u201d offered a rich study in American mythmaking. The landscapes of \u201cThree Places,\u201d built upon the fragmenting and layering of American folk songs, hymn tunes and ditties, are haunted by time and distorted by memory. The Sinfonietta evoked the dissonant fog of the Civil War in the \u201cSt. Gaudens\u201d movement, but individual motifs struggled to find definition. \u201cPutnam\u2019s Camp,\u201d with its boisterous and overlapping patriotic tunes, fared better, driven by the ensemble\u2019s bright, propulsive energy. Baritone Andrew McLaughlin provided the brooding vocal line for the final movement, \u201cThe Housatonic at Stockbridge,\u201d whose memory of a summer\u2019s walk in the Berkshires emerged as a fevered dream. Two lively songs by Ives, \u201cCharlie Rutlage\u201d and \u201cGeneral William Booth Enters into Heaven,\u201d reinforced the composer\u2019s experimentation with the American vernacular. \u201cAppalachian Spring,\u201d in its streamlined, sentimental concert version, offered an alternate vision of America: spare yet comforting in its melodies, nostalgic yet aspirational in its mythos. If the ensemble sounded tentative and lacked polish, there was consolation in the many moments of unaffected lyricism, not least of which were Elise Bond\u2019s mellifluous clarinet solos. While not a majestic \u201cAppalachian Spring,\u201d this performance nonetheless offered simple gifts. \n Chin is a freelance writer.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Simon Chin", "wordCount": 305}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Music review: Boris Giltburg\u2019s debut recital", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/334a2ea2/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cmusic0Ereview0Eboris0Egiltburgs0Edebut0Erecital0C20A130C110C0A40C89be0Adcc0E45680E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "Another day, another recent competition winner\u2019s debut recital in Washington.

He is a steely player who tends to wallop rather than caress the keyboard. He brought the audience to its feet mostly with circus-like demonstrations of virtuosity in Prokofiev\u2019s eighth sonata (Op. 84, B-flat major), especially the blockbuster finale, played with savage accuracy, and in the orchestral vastness of sound he produced in Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse.\u201d Sections of both pieces that pose fewer technical challenges were played expressively, but in a generally predictable and less audacious way.  Rachmaninoff\u2019s Op. 23 preludes featured many of the same qualities, hammered fortes in a wild tumult of notes in No. 2, overly soupy rubato in Nos. 4 and 10.

Italian pianist Beatrice Rana, who won the Silver Medal at this year\u2019s Van Cliburn Competition, gave an immaculate performance at her local debut Friday night in the Barns at Wolf Trap. There was almost nothing to criticize, but only occasionally did an interpretation compel attention. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rana used her refined technique to tame the venue\u2019s Yamaha piano, coaxing from it sounds of remarkable delicacy and finesse, especially in detailed inner voicings. Her performances of the two sets of variations by Schumann she played here, recorded at the Cliburn, are being released this month by Harmonia Mundi. In her live rendition of the \u201cAbegg Variations\u201d (Op. 1), the slow variations were even more distracted and moony, the rubato almost excessively free, and the fast ones just as polished and intricate. Her interpretation of the \u201cSymphonic Etudes\u201d (Op. 13), however, did not convince, as it was a little too controlled and cautious. She certainly mastered the work\u2019s technical challenges, but that is not enough. Rana played one of Prokofiev\u2019s concertos at the Cliburn Competition, and she gave his sixth piano sonata, a piece that is new to her repertory, plenty of sharp-fingered intensity, especially in a pristine performance of the blistering fourth movement. Rana\u2019s poise and intelligence came through, though, just as they did in the question-and-answer session that followed the recital, in which she spoke of her obsessive love of reading, especially the fiction of Haruki Murakami. It seems clear that as she matures \u2014 Rana is only 20 years old \u2014 she will become an artist one will want to keep an ear on. \n Downey is a freelance writer.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Charles T.

He gabs about his Texas roots, his unlikely early auditions and his triumphs as a performer, director and choreographer, all in easygoing patter between lightly crooned melodies such as \u201cI\u2019m Leavin\u2019 Texas\u201d and \u201cYou Gotta Have Heart.\u201d \u201cTaps\u201d is leaner; on Friday, it was just Tune (in a trim red three-piece suit) and his longtime musical director/pianist Michael Biagi, who was sporting a striped shirt, vest and bowler and looking as if he had been plucked straight from a vaudeville stage or a Jazz Age saloon. Even so, with little more than a smile and a song, Tune created a show that occasionally felt sneaky-big. Performers in the Kennedy Center\u2019s Barbara Cook series typically don\u2019t fuss much with design; it\u2019s a one-night-only showcase for singers. Yet Tune had lighting designer and production supervisor Patrick Rinn lower the lighting grid so that it hung in plain view, adding a potent theatrical ambiance to an evening laced with anecdotes about Tune\u2019s encounters with, oh, Laurence Olivier, Orson Welles, Carol Channing. (Apparently, when Tune and Channing chat, they address each other as \u201cTommy Tune\u201d and \u201cCarol Channing.\u201d It sounds adorable.) Late in the evening, Rinn cut the lights to knee height as Tune danced to a Gershwin medley anchored by \u201cThey Can\u2019t Take That Away From Me,\u201d this time using the full width of the stage, tapping at a measured pace but steadily adding to the patterns, and building to a finish that Biagi punctuated with a grand phrase from \u201cRhapsody in Blue.\u201d The illusion was wonderful: It felt as if you\u2019d glimpsed a full-blown show and somehow crossed a bridge back to a less overwhelming, more charming Broadway.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Nelson Pressley", "wordCount": 356}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Music review: Danish String Quartet\u2019s set at Library of Congress lacks fire and character", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/3340ca88/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cmusic0Ereview0Edanish0Estring0Equartets0Eset0Eat0Elibrary0Eof0Econgress0Elacks0Efire0Eand0Echaracter0C20A130C110C0A30Cd0A4c128e0E44af0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "String quartet playing requires a unique level of compatibility and mutual dedication. The rehearsal time and note-by-note scrutiny required from all members exceed that of any other ensemble, and in this high-intensity environment it helps a lot when the members have a common background. Which is probably why so many of the most celebrated quartets (Borodin, Tokyo, Berg, Smetana, Italiano) have been those where everyone came from the same place. And the Danish String Quartet \u2014 three Danes and a Norwegian \u2014 that performed on Saturday afternoon at the Library of Congress does play with uncommon unanimity. Formed in 2002, the group has won many competitions, has a number of recordings out and begins a Lincoln Center residency this season. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The reasons are evident: It is a true four-way collaboration. The violinists trade off the first chair, and no personality dominates (at least in performance). The young artists are all fine instrumentalists, and in matters of blend, intonation and technical dispatch, the group is certainly world-class. Homogeneity can be a shortcoming, however, if it extends to blandness, and in the two classical works Saturday, there was a want of fire and character. The first words one sees when beginning Haydn\u2019s Op. 76, No. 4 Quartet (the \u201cSunrise\u201d) are \u201cAllegro con spirito.\u201d That description was nowhere to be found in this performance, well groomed as it was. The other movements were impressive in execution, but with conservative tempos and a relatively narrow dynamic range. The same could be said of the group\u2019s performance of Beethoven\u2019s Op. 95 Quartet: impeccably beautiful playing with the surprises and violent dynamics smoothed out. This was not the case with the Ligeti Quartet No. 1, a fine and underrated work. Here, the performers tore into the dense music with a passion that would have been much appreciated in the classical works.

He began his program with the Irish Chamber Orchestra at the George Mason Center for the Arts on Saturday with comments about the two Irish composers on the program and with digs at the British empire and its relations, past and present, with Ireland. Then, as if just remembering himself, he reminded the audience that, as Sir James, he was probably part of the establishment he was decrying. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, he is, to the flute, what Pablo Casals was to the cello and Andres Segovia to the guitar \u2014 the name everyone knows \u2014 and he puts on a great show, not just musically and technically, but also as an entertainer. He danced gracefully through the Mozart D Major Flute Concerto (originally for oboe), the luscious tone he gets from his shiny gold instrument rising easily over the small orchestra in the delicate arabesques and curlicues of the outer movements and in the long legato lines of the Andante (although, to my ears, his flute was tuned just on the high side of the pitch). He romped happily through the Irish tunes that inspired Hamilton Harty\u2019s \u201cIn Ireland,\u201d and then he and his wife, Lady Jeanne Galway, another splendid flutist, teamed up on \u201cCarolan Variations,\u201d a nicely crafted work by Philip Hammond, playing with a beautifully coordinated ensemble in which even their vibratos synchronized.  For encores preceding the intermission, Galway tossed off a movement from a Mozart piano sonata, \u201cJingle Bells\u201d for \u201cthe little girl in the front row\u201d (that woke up the children near me in the audience), an Irish jig and, with his wife, a dance movement from the Bach Suite No 2. The applause was huge. After intermission the orchestra, with JoAnn Falletta at the helm, returned with a performance of Mozart\u2019s \u201cJupiter\u201d Symphony No. 41 that struggled with the problems that had plagued the orchestra throughout, the absence of a common understanding of how the music should be shaped. Phrase endings had little character.

He was 91. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t His longtime partner and common-law wife, Sara Tsutsumi-Wess, said he died in a taxicab on his way to dialysis treatment for a kidney ailment. Mr. Wess began his career in Washington, where he moved from Oklahoma in 1935. He had temporarily stopped playing until he heard a group of students jamming during lunch hour at Dunbar High School. One of the students was Billy Taylor, who switched from saxophone to piano after hearing Mr. Wess play. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t play tenor saxophone,\u201d Taylor, who died in 2010 , told The Washington Post in 2008. \u201cEven in his teens, he was a remarkable player.\u201d Mr. Wess, who studied classical music in his youth, received much of his early jazz training at U Street nightclubs, such as the Club Bali, Republic Gardens, Crystal Caverns and Club Bengasi. \u201cYou had to learn jazz in the streets,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cIf you played it in the conservatory, they\u2019d throw you out.\u201d Mr. Wess learned his lessons well and went on to a quiet but distinguished career as a saxophonist, flutist and composer. He was honored in 2007 as a jazz master by the National Endowment for the Arts, the country\u2019s highest award for a jazz musician. In the mid-1940s, Mr. Wess was a member of singer Billy Eckstine\u2019s influential big band, which featured at various times such jazz stars as singer Sarah Vaughan; trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro; saxophonists Charlie Parker and Dexter Gordon; and drummer Art Blakey. By 1953, Mr. Wess had joined the \u201cNew Testament\u201d version of Basie\u2019s band, which was beginning a resurgence that would return the group to the preeminence it had known in the 1930s. Mr. Wess recruited several other key members of the band, including trumpeter-arranger Thad Jones, trombonist Bill Hughes, saxophonist Eric Dixon and double bassist Eddie Jones. In the beginning, Mr. Wess played primarily tenor saxophone, but Basie had heard that he was also skilled on the flute, then little used in jazz. One day during a jam session, Basie recalled in his autobiography, \u201cGood Morning Blues,\u201d \u201cI told Frank, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take a couple of choruses on your flute?\u2019\u200a\u201d Mr. Wess seemed surprised by the request, but nevertheless took out his flute and played. \u201cAs soon as I heard him, that was when I realized that we had a new thing,\u201d Basie continued. \u201cSo that\u2019s how the flute thing started. .\u2009.\u2009. And not long after that, everywhere you looked, here come the flutes. .\u2009.\u2009. They can put something different in somebody\u2019s else\u2019s books, but Frank Wess is the man who really brought the flute into the jazz scene beginning right down there at Birdland.\u201d With his solos in \u201c Cute \u201d and other tunes in the Basie songbook, Mr. Wess \u201cgave a new instrumental sound not just to the band, but to the whole of jazz,\u201d critic Will Friedwald wrote in 2005.   In his 11 years with Basie, Mr. Wess wrote several tunes and appeared on the classic \u201cApril in Paris\u201d (1955) and \u201cAtomic Mr. Basie\u201d (1958) albums. His casually swinging solo on \u201c Corner Pocket \u201d is one of the most memorable moments in the Basie group\u2019s history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t For years, Mr. Wess played alongside his fellow tenor saxophonist Frank Foster , who later became the leader of the Basie band before his death in 2011. Their complementary styles \u2014 Foster was aggressive and boppish where Mr. Wess was lyrical and relaxed \u2014 provided a sense of musical balance that gave the Basie band much of its lasting appeal. Their friendly saxophone battles became such a staple of Basie\u2019s performances that composer Neal Hefti wrote a tune, \u201cTwo Franks,\u201d just for them. \u201cMany people have not recognized what Frank has done,\u201d Taylor told The Post in 2008. \u201cPeople just took him for granted.\u201d Frank Wellington Wess was born Jan. 4, 1922, in Kansas City, Mo., and spent his early years in Sapulpa, Okla., before moving to Washington at 13. At Dunbar, he and Taylor studied with Henry Grimes, the same teacher who had been influential in the early life of their fellow Washingtonian, Duke Ellington. Mr. Wess was an Army musician during World War II and, at age 20, was leading a 17-piece band. \u201cWe were sent to Africa in 1942,\u201d he recalled in a 2005 interview with the All About Jazz Web site. \u201cWhen we got down there, the first gig we played was for the Americans, the Germans and the English. Can you believe that? The were all dancing together.\u201d After working with Eckstine\u2019s band and other groups, Mr. Wess settled in Washington in 1949 and studied flute with Wallace Mann of the National Symphony Orchestra. In the 1960s and \u201970s, he was playing in Broadway pit orchestras and for several TV programs, including the talk shows of David Frost and Dick Cavett. He was even part of the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band in the late 1970s, before gaining a following late in his career as a soloist and leader of his own groups. In 1994, Mr. Wess was the first guest on Taylor\u2019s NPR show, \u201cJazz at the Kennedy Center.\u201d He appeared on hundreds of recordings, including \u201cMagic 101,\u201d which was released this summer and received a glowing review in DownBeat magazine in September. His final album, \u201cMagic 201,\u201d will appear next year. \u201cRetire?\u201d he said in 2005. \u201cTo what? I\u2019ve never done anything else in my life.\u201d He was predeceased by his first wife, Virginia Wess, and a son, Richard Wess. In addition to his common-law wife, Sara Tsutsumi of New York, survivors include two daughters from his first marriage, Michelle Kane and Francine Wess, both of New York; two grandchildren; and four grandchildren. Mr. Wess came from the old school of jazz, where a sense of soul-stirring swing was what mattered most. \u201cIf you can\u2019t tap your foot or dance to it, you may as well be driving a cab,\u201d he said in 2005. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Matt Schudel", "wordCount": 1010}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "John Fogerty on CCR\u2019s \u2018Cosmo\u2019s Factory\u2019: \u2018I was sort of an unstoppable force\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/333a4cff/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cjohn0Efogerty0Eon0Eccrs0Ecosmos0Efactory0Ei0Ewas0Esort0Eof0Ean0Eunstoppable0Eforce0C20A130C10A0C30A0Cce6a5ab0A0E40Abe0E11e30E9c8b0Ee8deeb3c755b0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "In the canon of American rock-and-roll, how many great bands were as efficient as Creedence Clearwater Revival? In its six years together, which bridged the \u201960s and \u201970s, the John Fogerty-led group released seven albums and was responsible for classic rock radio staples such as \u201c Proud Mary , \u201c Who\u2019ll Stop the Rain \u201d and \u201c Fortunate Son \u201d along with great extended guitar workouts such as \u201c Keep on Chooglin \u2019\u201d and \u201c Ramble Tamble .\u201d The latter, a seven-minute stomper, is the lead track off 1970\u2019s \u201cCosmo\u2019s Factory,\u201d which Fogerty and his band will perform in full at DAR Constitution Hall on Friday, Nov. 8 . (The set list will be filled with plenty more hits, too.) Fogerty talked about the album\u2019s legacy more than 40 years after its release. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n So you\u2019re playing [\u201cCosmo\u2019s Factory\u201d] in its entirety but not in order, is that right? \n\n We kind of decided to reimagine it for the setting of a live show. Things are just different in front of people. In the deference to the energy of a live show you sort of want to have things flow in the right way so it can be the best it can be live. \n\n I was thinking that starting with \u201cRamble Tamble\u201d .\u2009.\u2009. seems like you\u2019d need a few songs to work up to that. \n\n I\u2019m sure the band could do it. In the early versions of doing this show we did that. I had always placed it a little bit down on the list, maybe eighth or ninth or something. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now. \n\n That song is obviously not the most popular Creedence song, but to me it\u2019s one of the band\u2019s signature songs. What do you think? \n\n Isn\u2019t that funny? As a kid, a young musician that was steering the ship with Creedence, I was way into guitar heroes and all that. I loved all the other guys that were my peers \u2014 Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton. All the rockers in all the bands. And there was quite a .\u2009.\u2009. we all noticed each other, put it that way. So the idea of a lot of guitar was fun to me. I just really wanted to have that aspect going in my band. And it is sort of humorous now. My wife helps me in a zillion ways, but one of the differences between boys and girls, well, number one, we like the Three Stooges. I heard Jay Leno say that once, and that seems probably right on. And I think guys tend to like guitar stuff more than girls. Girls are into things with heart and emotion and all that. And that\u2019s great. So we\u2019re at a constant sort of .\u2009.\u2009. she\u2019s looking at my guitars and going, \u201cNow you gotta trim that down a little bit.\u201d I\u2019m thinking of ways I can get one more solo in there. It\u2019s still that way even now. \n\n How did you decide to do the full-album tour? Was that an idea you were always into? \n Well, it was actually an idea my wife said to me one day. .\u2009.\u2009. I went: \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know, honey. Why would anybody want to do that?\u201d But the more I thought about it, what it did was it kind of placed you in that era. And it made you remember a lot of stuff that was around the album. I\u2019m a fan, I buy albums, too. I sure remember sitting with Elvis\u2019s first album, I don\u2019t know how many thousands of times. Or Buddy Holly and the Crickets\u2019 first album. And you sit there and you\u2019re listening. You\u2019re just in that place because it was so magical. And somehow that stays in you. That little chapter gets tucked away in your brain even though you live another 40 years. But somehow going and doing that, listening to the whole record puts you right back in that place you were all those years ago when you did it that way. .\u2009.\u2009. It\u2019s a pretty fascinating phenomenon really.   Where do you think \u201cCosmo\u2019s\u201d fits into the Creedence discography? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t When I did \u201cCosmo\u2019s Factory,\u201d in my mind, it was sort of \u2014 at the time \u2014 a culmination. I was really kind of going to pack it full, thinking that I was then going to turn a corner and go off into a new place. Unfortunately, there was so much tension within the band that the new place wasn\u2019t necessarily happy. (Laughs.) .\u2009.\u2009. When I look back now, I can sure see how pretty amazing \u201cCosmo\u2019s Factory\u201d is. There\u2019s at least six charted singles on that album, and if you also want to include \u201cHeard It Through the Grapevine,\u201d that\u2019s seven. I mean that\u2019s kind of like Michael Jackson territory. (Laughs.) But at the time I just sort of took that in stride. That was what we were doing back then.  \n\n The band accomplished so much in such a condensed time period. Now it\u2019s normal for bands to wait three years between albums, but Creedence didn\u2019t waste much time. \n\n As you probably know, the history of the band \u2014 I was a very strong leader, and I had a mountain, a whole roomful of musical ideas. So I was sort of an unstoppable force. Basically the hardest part was just getting the band up to speed musically so they could record and accomplish these songs. And also just to be in sync and on the same page, wanting to do it. As the success and time went on and got greater there was more and more dissension within the band. You mention how other bands are. What happens then is you spend half your time in the political realm, meaning, well, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to do that song.\u201d Or, \u201cI want to come up with my own song.\u201d That takes time. There\u2019s a lot of time being consumed in bands where everybody\u2019s having their say, then you have a meeting, you take a vote \u2014 you see what I\u2019m getting at. But basically, \u201cCosmo\u2019s Factory\u201d was really the very end of me being very strong and very pure and very clear in my direction. And after that .\u2009.\u2009. \n (laughs) \n .\u2009.\u2009. the fine running machine was starting to get a little wobbly. Democracy\u2019s a wonderful thing. But as we all know in America, it\u2019s really hard to manage. \n John Fogerty \n \n \n Performing at DAR Constitution Hall on Friday, Nov. 8.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "David Malitz", "wordCount": 1063}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "On Love: Julie Sloan marries Adam Mark", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/333d4d53/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cstyle0C20A130C0A10C140Cef69783e0E40A0Ac0E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "Julie Sloan was one month into a three-month internship in Charlotte when Adam Mark invited her to dinner. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t She said yes, and then confessed to her sister, \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a date.\u201d In fact, Adam did hope the evening would turn romantic.

But Adam often worked until nearly midnight, and Julie had to report to her internship at 7:30 a.m., so that left them just the pre-dawn hours and very little sleep. \u201cYou can sleep when you\u2019re dead,\u201d Adam remembers saying. The week Julie was scheduled to return to Maryland, they spent three days at the beach, where Adam asked whether she would be his girlfriend. \u201cI had never met anyone like her before,\u201d says Adam, now 29. \u201cSeeing her with Greyson was amazing. And she was always so sweet and so loving that I couldn\u2019t not ask her.\u201d Julie wavered. She had been in long-distance relationships before that had ended badly. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know. We have so much going on right now.\u2019 He was starting a new job. I was going to Maryland, starting grad school,\u201d she says. But after thinking about it and consulting with her mom, she decided to give it a shot. Hectic schedules meant they were able to visit each other only every couple of months, but they talked every day by phone. \u201cWhich, honestly, I think really built a solid ground for us,\u201d Julie says. \u201cWe got to know each other really well, because all we were doing was talking and telling stories about our day \u2014 everything you would do in a normal relationship, just on the phone. It built the groundwork for our relationship, because I really feel like I know everything about him.\u201d The three-month period in which Julie lived in Charlotte was the only time she had ever spent living outside Maryland. But, as her graduation neared in spring\u00a02011, she began to think about moving back to North Carolina, where she knew almost no one except Adam, because her sister had returned to Maryland.   \u201cI grew up in one house my entire life in Gaithersburg and then went to college in Towson, so it was a very hard decision,\u201d she says. But she decided to make the leap. And, in August 2012, she started renting a Charlotte apartment near Adam and Greyson. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Six months later, the three of them moved in together. Suddenly, Julie was cooking dinner for Greyson and asking him to put his things away. They played games at night and found fun adventures on the weekends. The thing that had given her the biggest pause about dating Adam was now one of the factors she loved most about life with him.  \u201cWe have a lot of fun together,\u201d she says. \u201cGreyson is just a special kid, he really is. So once I got to know Greyson, there was no turning back.\u201d In July 2012, during Greyson\u2019s first visit to Maryland, Adam intended to propose near the reflecting pool on the Mall. His plans started to go awry when the ring in his pocket set off security alarms at the garage where they had parked. Panicked, he subtly flashed the ring at the guard, after hiding it in his shoe, and was waved through. Then they got to the reflecting pool only to find that it had been drained. Finally, as they watched planes fly overhead from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he asked Julie to marry him. By the time they woke up the next morning, Julie\u2019s mom had picked out several possible sites for the wedding for the couple to consider. That night, they visited Glen Echo and immediately fell in love with the art deco amusement park. Wedding planning was a breeze, until a week and a half before the big day, when Julie heard that an impending government shutdown might prevent private events from happening at Glen Echo, which is part of the National Park Service. Two days later, her fears were confirmed, \u201cand I had a minor panic attack,\u201d Julie, now 24, says. After calling around to other reception sites in the area, they arranged to move the wedding to the Strathmore Music Center in North Bethesda. \u201cWelcome to Glen Echo East,\u201d Cantor George Henschel said to the 90 guests gathered under a gray sky at Strathmore to watch the pair exchange vows Oct. 13. Greyson stood by as one of Adam\u2019s two best men. Then he, Julie and Adam poured sand of different colors into a vase to symbolize their becoming a family. Before the wedding, Julie reflected on what makes her relationship with Adam special. \u201cOur senses of humor match each other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe both just like to laugh at ourselves and be goofy. And we\u2019re just comfortable with each other.\u201d", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Ellen McCarthy", "wordCount": 1045}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Midgette: Review roundup: Shao, Bailey impress on cello; Kronos plays new Philip Glass quartet; and more", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/3333c00c/sc/15/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cclassical0Ebeat0Cpost0Creview0Eroundup0Eshao0Ebailey0Eimpress0Eon0Ecello0Ekronos0Eplays0Enew0Ephilip0Eglass0Equartet0Eand0Emore0C20A130C110C0A10C7d520A2860E432f0E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "It\u2019s time for another roundup of recent classical music reviews. \n I attended Yuja Wang\u2019s recital at Strathmore last week and found the playing brilliant but oddly distanced; I later heard third-hand that she may actually have been indisposed, in which case my take should shift from \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d to \u201cwho can actually play that well when they\u2019re sick?\u201d \n Robert Battey attended an uneven but sometimes exhilerating performance by the Cuarteto Casals at the Library of Congress ; was impressed by Chris Thile playing, among other things, Bach on the mandolin at Strathmore; and, last night, heard Kristjan Jarvi lead the NSO with what I might call modified rapture.

He has been branded as reactionary by some. But to more conservative listeners, his music still sounds too contemporary. \u25cfHe is one of the most important opera composers of the 20th century, but this year, which is his centennial \u2014 he would have been 100 on Nov. 22 \u2014 he has been slightly overshadowed by the bicentennials of Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner . \u25cfDuring his lifetime, he was celebrated: the recording of his \u201cWar Requiem,\u201d which had its premiere in 1962, sold 200,000 copies. But the musical establishment tended to find him \u2014 a composer who, in the age of serialist techniques, electronic music and John Cage, chose to write melodic, tonal operas and church canticles for children \u2014 unserious. \u201cIt may turn out,\u201d wrote Harold C. Schonberg in the New York Times, reviewing \u201cWar Requiem\u2019s\u201d 1963 American premiere at the Tanglewood Music Center, \u201cthat \u2018A War Requiem\u2019 will not, in the long run, have staying power because of a certain obviousness.\u201d On the most obvious level, Schonberg was wrong. \u201cWar Requiem\u201d resurfaces often, is still hailed as a masterpiece and is getting two separate performances this month in the Washington area alone: the Washington Chorus\u2019s at the Kennedy Center on Sunday and the Baltimore Sym\u00adphony Orchestra\u2019s in Baltimore and at Strathmore from Nov. 14 to 16. (The Washington Chorus\u2019s recording of its 1995 performance, released in 2000, even won a Grammy.) But \u201cWar Requiem\u201d is a contradictory piece, and somewhat anomalous in the British composer\u2019s canon: big and bombastic in an oeuvre characterized by nuance, subtlety and gently shifting emotions. So the charge of obviousness has a ring of truth , as well . As to \u201cstaying power,\u201d it could be asked of Britten\u2019s work as a whole. \u201cPeter Grimes\u201d and, to a lesser extent, \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and \u201cThe Turn of the Screw\u201d have never left the repertoire, but much of his other work remains in the category of curiosity, and much has been undeservedly neglected. Julian Wachner, who leads both the Washington Chorus and the music program at New York\u2019s Trinity Church, is immersing himself in Britten this fall: in addition to the \u201cWar Requiem\u201d in Washington, he is doing a festival in New York of all of Britten\u2019s non-operatic work \u2014 90 pieces, many little known. \u201cThe question is, Why isn\u2019t Britten a mainstay of the chamber music repertory?\u201d Wachner says. \u201cPeople are going away [from the Trinity concerts] going, \u2018Oh my God, I had no idea,\u2019 and the players, too.\u201d \u201cMaybe after this anniversary, his music will be played more,\u201d says Marin Alsop, the music director of the BSO. \u201cThere\u2019s so much of it that doesn\u2019t get to the concert hall.\u201d \u201cWar Requiem\u201d does remain in the concert hall, imposing because of its message, and because of its scale. It\u2019s a massive work: nearly 90 minutes, involving two separate orchestras (a full orchestra and a chamber orchestra), an adult chorus, a children\u2019s chorus and three vocal soloists. Commissioned for the reopening of Coventry Cathedral, nearly two decades after its destruction by German bombs, the piece is conceived as a kind of play-within-a-play: the traditional Latin text of the Requiem mass, sung by the chorus and soprano soloist and accompanied by the full orchestra, is interleaved with poems by Wilfred Owen about the horrors of World War I, sung by the two male soloists and accompanied by chamber orchestra.   \u201cYou have an entirely different vocabulary for the big orchestra and choir pieces,\u201d Alsop says, and the chamber-orchestra sections. \u201cYou have the traditional Requiem mass, but the ground underneath you is very shaky harmonically, then you go into chamber orchestra sections which, while very contemporary, are far more tonal. I love that juxtaposition.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t What Schonberg called \u201cobviousness\u201d was generally one of Britten\u2019s strengths: in common with some other great opera composers, he had an emotional directness that can border on naivete.  This comes out strongly in \u201cWar Requiem,\u201d which is a piece with a mission: it doesn\u2019t want anyone to miss the message. Britten was a pacifist, a conscientious objector \u2014 something that drew criticism in the early days of World War II, when his \n initial response to the gathering storm clouds in Europe was to leave England altogether. \u201cWar Requiem\u201d was his chance to make a clear antiwar statement: memorializing the devastation of World War II with poems about World War I, premiered at the height of the Cold War. To symbolize the advent of peace, Britten cast soloists from three once-hostile nations: the British tenor Peter Pears (Britten\u2019s life partner), the German baritone Dietrich \u00adFischer-Dieskau and the Russian soprano Galina Vishnevskaya. But the Russians prevented Vishnevskaya from leaving the country at the last minute, thereby emphasizing not the cessation of hostilities, but their tacit continuation. Britten\u2019s goals also had a sociological component. His many works for children\u2019s chorus, chamber opera ensemble and adult chorus address the practical challenges of getting music out into the community, and \u201cWar Requiem\u201d includes all of these forces. \u201cI love for us to be able to involve so many different segments of the community,\u201d Alsop says. \u201cIt makes it a much more communal experience, and I think it enhances that kind of spiritual quality that people get from belonging to a spiritual community.\u201d \u201cWhat I love about Britten is that he doesn\u2019t write stupid music for kids,\u201d Wachner says. \u201cHe writes music that they have to work their [tails] off to learn, but they can learn it.\u201d Wachner, a composer himself, is intrigued by what he refers to as the limitations of Britten\u2019s technical palette. \u201cThere\u2019s not so many ways [Britten] does compose,\u201d he says, \u201cbut he\u2019s able to express all these different stories, feelings, emotions within a rather restricted palette of compositional technique.\u201d He notes the way certain passages of Britten will evoke unrelated moments in other works, but be used to completely different effect. Britten is one of the greatest composers: lyrical, wise, distinctive, unique. But \u201cWar Requiem\u201d does not necessarily draw on those particular strengths. This kind of grand canvas was never quite natural to a composer who was a master of emotional nuance, of chamber opera, of art song, and who by the 1960s was favoring increasingly spare musical textures. \u201cWar Requiem\u201d was, in a sense, a return to an earlier mode, as if shouting intimacies into a megaphone; it trumpets at every step exactly what it is doing. Performances of the work can leave you feeling slightly bludgeoned; in lieu of characters, we have here the blunter emotions of pain and sorrow and anger. The men are sorrowful protesters; the soprano is, in Wachner\u2019s words, \u201can angry angel.\u201d There is no arguing with anything that the piece is saying, and it says it insistently. It is this that Schonberg was referring to when he questioned the work\u2019s ability to endure. In a sense, \u201cWar Requiem\u201d prevails in part because of its extra-musical components, all of the neat stuff it offers, its always-timely message. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important piece sociologically and politically,\u201d Alsop says. \u201cIt can conjure up that entire decade of our shared history.\u201d In short, it\u2019s a work that reflects its place, its time, its history. It may not be Britten\u2019s greatest work, but it is certainly one that makes itself heard. \n War Requiem \n \n \n The Washington Chorus\u2019s performance of \u201cWar Requiem\u201d will take place at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall at 7:30 p.m. Sunday. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's performance will take place at Strathmore on Nov. 16 at 8 p.m., after performances at Meyerhoff Symphony Hall in Baltimore on Nov. 14 and 15.

It might have started in the crowd at the Capital Centre in 1983, when he saw Sting fronting the Police. \u201cI pointed to the stage and said, \u2018I want to do that ,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI loved music. But I also loved that it spoke to people\u2019s hearts and lives.\u201d Maybe it actually started when McKeehan was 13, attending a church camp in rural Virginia, listening to a counselor read words off a page. \u201cAt church, it was a guy behind a box yelling and screaming,\u201d McKeehan says. \u201cThis dude sat on the floor of a cabin with us, opened up a Bible and read it. And it all came to life.\u201d Today, McKeehan stands as arguably the biggest star in Christian pop music. In the \u201990s, his groundbreaking group, dc Talk , made faith-based rap-rock that was brash enough to crack MTV, but wholesome enough to get them invited to Billy Graham\u2019s house. Last year, McKeehan\u2019s 10th solo album as TobyMac, \u201c Eye On It ,\u201d debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s album chart \u2014 the first contemporary Christian music album to achieve that feat since 1997. Last month, McKeehan snagged four trophies at the Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, including artist of the year. After the show, Christian rap star Lecrae gushed to reporters, \u201cTobyMac is a legend.\u201d But in late September, nobody on M Street recognizes McKeehan. He\u2019s lean and chipper, sporting a crisp baseball cap that makes it difficult to believe he\u2019s just a year shy of 50. He\u2019s left his wife and five children back home in Franklin, Tenn., for a weekend festival gig in Loudoun County \u2014 one of the 80-ish concerts he\u2019ll play in any given year. (TobyMac headlines Baltimore Arena on Saturday, Nov. 9.) He speaks of his rising profile with careful humility, consistently deflecting credit to his fans. And they\u2019ve been an extremely loyal bloc, helping McKeehan\u2019s career thrive while secular artists have suffered the aftershocks of a perpetually slumping record business. Since going solo in 2001, McKeehan says most of his albums have sold between 600,000 and 700,000 copies each. \u201cThey\u2019re very loyal people,\u201d McKeehan says of his fanbase. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to rock, they\u2019re looking to dance, they\u2019re looking to throw their hands in the air. But they\u2019re also looking for something that speaks to their life.\u201d \u201cI hung out here with the Beastie Boys, once,\u201d McKeehan says, strolling Georgetown\u2019s brick sidewalks. \u201cThey were playing the 9:30 Club and they walked out of their sound check, like, \u2018Where can we go around here?\u2019\u200a\u201d McKeehan hailed a cab from the club\u2019s former F Street location and took them to Georgetown for ice cream. It was 1986. He had discovered hip-hop years earlier, while attending Bethlehem Baptist Christian Academy in Fairfax. One afternoon, his friends took the Metro into the city to buy the latest records from Sugarhill Gang and Kurtis Blow, as well as go-go groups Trouble Funk and Redds and the Boys.   But McKeehan didn\u2019t really start making music of his own until college. After a year at Jacksonville University in Florida on a golf scholarship, he was itching to join his friends at Liberty University, the college founded by Jerry Falwell in Lynchburg, Va. McKeehan\u2019s father, a real estate agent who had sold then-Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs his home, helped with some string-pulling. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThe story that I was told was that Joe Gibbs called Jerry Falwell and said, \u2018You need to start a golf program,\u2019\u201d McKeehan says. \u201cThe next year, I\u2019m at Liberty, playing golf.\u201d He also started making music with his buddies Kevin Max Smith and Michael Tait, the latter a Washington native who grew up on Capitol Hill. Tait was into gospel. McKeehan wanted to rap like LL Cool J. They named their group dc Talk, after the stage-name McKeehan was using for himself around campus. McKeehan says that while many still view contemporary Christian music as stylistically constrained, working in the genre gave dc Talk great freedom. \u201cAnd I say this in all humility,\u201d McKeehan says, \u201cbut there weren\u2019t a lot of singers and rappers coming together. Now it\u2019s everyday. But back then, without a doubt, it was unique.\u201d The band\u2019s career exploded in 1995 with the release of its double-platinum album, \u201c Jesus Freak .\u201d A video for its grunge-rap title track was directed by Simon Maxwell, who had worked with Nine Inch Nails, and helped catapult the group onto MTV. In the years that followed, other Christian rock bands quietly floated onto mainstream radio airwaves with little fanfare being made about their faith \u2014 Switchfoot, P.O.D. , Creed , Evanescence, Chevelle, Skillet. Since going solo in 2001, McKeehan\u2019s music has mellowed into a glossier, more inclusive shade of pop. He\u2019s purposefully casting a wide net through his own music, and through Gotee Records , the Nashville-based record label he launched in 1994. In its busiest years, Gotee released big-selling albums from songwriter Jennifer Knapp and emo troupe Relient K, and is currently home to Capital Kings, a clean-cut pop duo with roots in Northern Virginia. \u201cWe grew up listening to Toby, all the way back to the dc Talk days,\u201d says Jon White of Capital Kings. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s presenting our music to his fans, saying, \u2018This is my fanbase, I want them to hear what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 .\u2009.\u2009. At this stage in his career, it\u2019s crazy that he\u2019s taken the time to come alongside us. It\u2019s humbling.\u201d But if reaching people means selling great quantities of albums, does McKeehan see his work as ministry or business? \u201cTo me, this is business,\u201d McKeehan says. \u201cIf I\u2019m charging 25, 35 bucks a ticket and charging 10 bucks to buy my CD, it\u2019s a business. You can\u2019t call it ministry at that point .\u2009.\u2009. If God chooses to minister through me talking about my life, then so be it. But I can\u2019t call it that.\u201d After breakfast in Georgetown, the nostalgia trip continues into Fairfax County, past McKeehan\u2019s childhood home, along his old paper route, over to the schoolyard of Luther Jackson Middle School where he had his first kiss, into the parking lot of the Frozen Dairy Bar on Arlington Boulevard. \u201cMe and my cousin Joey used to love this place,\u201d he says, blue eyes sparkling. He walks up to the counter and orders a cup of vanilla. \u201cIs that boring?\u201d He can\u2019t remember if he ordered the same thing in Georgetown with the Beasties \u2014 it\u2019s been 27 years, after all. McKeehan hasn\u2019t lived in the area since high school and doesn\u2019t make it back to visit too often. So much has changed. Including him. And his music. \u201cThere are early dc Talk lyrics that make me cringe,\u201d he says. \u201cThey felt judgemental, like we had it together, had the answers.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look a lot older, but he certainly feels a lot wiser, and says he\u2019s invigorated by changing attitudes currently sweeping across the Christian faith. \u201cI love to see [Christians] reaching out and loving well, instead of being insulated and judging,\u201d he says. \u201cI would hope that I\u2019m an artist that\u2019s opening people\u2019s minds about what it means to be a believer walking in this world every day.\u201d And he\u2019d rather do it through a song than a sermon. \u201cI want to draw people in because they love the music ,\u201d McKeehan says. \u201cAnd if they hear something in it that\u2019s for them, it makes me happy because it\u2019s something that worked for me. It\u2019s the hope that I\u2019ve been offered. You\u2019re gonna hear hope in a lot of people\u2019s music, but we might resolve differently.

He was big on eye contact, too, staring down listeners one by one, as if to say, \u201cYou getting all this?\u201d But when Drake\u2019s three-man backing band launched into a new tune, his eyes would clamp shut, his jaw would clench and his fists would joyfully punch at the air, as if his favorite song had just come on the radio. That\u2019s a familiar sensation for just about anyone, considering that this guy has enjoyed an almost suffocating presence on urban radio for the past three years. If you\u2019re a top-tier hip-hop artist, a guest appearance from Drake can instantly turn your single into a hit. According to the lyrics of his recent chart-climber \u201cStarted From the Bottom,\u201d his dominance is rooted in his ubiquity: \u201cThere ain\u2019t really much out here that\u2019s poppin\u2019 off without us.\u201d Drake closed the show with that one, after jogging through a medley of cameo tracks where he\u2019s always been the main attraction. There was the riotous chatter of French Montana\u2019s \u201cPop That,\u201d the squeak and purr of DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m on One\u201d and the eerie boom of 2 Chainz\u2019s \u201cNo Lie.\u201d Somewhere in the middle of the hit barrage, Drake boasted, \u201cI got, like, a hundred of these.\u201d No lie, no lie. He owes his omnipresence to the fact that he might be the most adaptable rapper working today. He proved his flexibility with \u201cVersace,\u201d an exercise in rap hypnosis originally by the Atlanta trio Migos. The song featured a harsh, sputtering vocal cadence, during which Drake fluttered his fingertips, perhaps typing out the lyrics on some phantom laptop. Of course, a Drake performance also doubles as an R&B show, considering how much melody the rapper breathes into his rhymes. His strongest vocal showing was his recent single, \u201cHold On, We\u2019re Going Home,\u201d which seemed like a drowsier, dreamier version of DeBarge\u2019s 1985 hit, \u201cRhythm of the Night.\u201d There were other voices up there, too. Drake was joined by Atlanta\u2019s Future, whose scorched syllables disintegrated before they left his mouth, and R&B singer Jhene Aiko, whose cool refrains provided a fine counterpoint to the headliner\u2019s warmth. And during a quick intermission, Drake shored up his D.C. cred for life by inviting members of the legendary go-go troupe Backyard Band to the stage. Then, more hits, more eye contact. Toward the end of the set, Drake spent more than 10 minutes gazing off into the audience, pointing out individual fans. It\u2019s become his ritual and his gimmick, but it paralleled the intimacy of his music in a way that felt sincere. Plus, the Halloween costumes worn by some fans triggered a few great shout-outs: \u201cI see you in the stripes .\u2009.\u2009. I see you in the red dress .\u2009.\u2009. I see you dressed up as a banana .\u2009.\u2009. A lot of girls chose to be cats tonight. Next year, you should choose a more original costume.\u201d Sound advice from a superstar still being himself.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Chris Richards", "wordCount": 628}, {"date": "2013-10-31 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "With uncertain direction, NSO still intermittently shines", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/332adaea/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cwith0Euncertain0Edirection0Enso0Estill0Eintermittently0Eshines0C20A130C10A0C310C78eca2520E429c0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "The J\u00e4rvi conducting dynasty (father Neeme, sons Paavo and Kristjan) has blanketed the profession, one or another of them popping up seemingly everywhere an orchestra can be found in Europe or the United States. Kristjan, a youthful 31, trained at the Manhattan School of Music and the University of Michigan and is gradually building up a solid career, guest-conducting such top orchestras as the Berlin Philharmonic, London Symphony and Orchestre de Paris. His engagement with the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center this week is his second, after a 2010 debut, and it was underwhelming. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t In a program of melodious 20th-century pieces, J\u00e4rvi came across as sort of a \u201cpost-modern\u201d conductor, with hip-swaying and shoulder-shimmying that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a dance club and curlicues with the baton that conveyed something like, \u201cThe beat\u2019s in there somewhere \u2014 have fun with it!\u201d But there was not a lot of musical substance behind all this. In George Enescu\u2019s potboiler, the Rumanian Rhapsody No. 1, J\u00e4rvi never tried to shape the endless oom-pah accompaniment, letting it remain just a lumbering, taurine mess. He conducted the waltz movement from Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cSymphonic Dances\u201d in one beat to the bar throughout, even in the slowest sections; those playing the crucial off-beats were left to guess at his exact intentions. And I saw no effort whatsoever to deal with the most pervasive problem with this orchestra in this hall: the ease with which the brass and percussion bury the rest of the players. Jennifer Koh, the soloist in Samuel Barber\u2019s Violin Concerto, was victimized by this. She is a visually intense player but does not have an especially large or rich sound to begin with; here she was forced to push what she had to the limit, in an often-futile attempt to cut through the mush behind her. The tone became dry and forced, particularly unfortunate in this piece, which emphasizes the emotional, lyrical side of the instrument \u2014 the slow movement, with its big oboe solo, is a clear tip of the hat to Brahms. The finale, though, is a breathless moto perpetuo, quite jarring after the first two movements. Koh certainly seemed to be on top of the frantic passage work (when you could hear her), but the orchestra was still trying to catch up. That said, for the most part the NSO played impressively Thursday night despite the unfocused leadership. The many wind solos in the Enescu and Rachmaninoff were solid and strongly characterized. Concertmistress Nurit Bar-Josef, in just a brief solo in the Rachmaninoff waltz, displayed a sonority of almost lurid force that the evening\u2019s guest soloist had never achieved. The massed strings rang out with enjoyable power in the big tunes. J\u00e4rvi\u2019s shortcomings \u2014 which include an energetic beat that nonetheless often fails to convey the character of what\u2019s about to come \u2014 may well solidify with more experience. And now that they\u2019ve gotten through it once, the NSO may well cohere better around him at Friday and Saturday\u2019s performances. \n Battey is a freelance writer.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Robert Battey", "wordCount": 502}, {"date": "2013-10-31 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Concert review: Fitz and the Tantrums, Capital Cities at the 9:30 Club", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/332a1ae4/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cconcert0Ereview0Efitz0Eand0Ethe0Etantrums0Ecapital0Ecities0Eat0Ethe0E930A0Eclub0C20A130C10A0C310C4888ef180E42460E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "Generally, it\u2019s a bad sign when a band is more energetic than its audience. But from the moment Fitz and the Tantrums burst onto the stage at 9:30 Club on Wednesday, it wasn\u2019t a fair fight. Lead singers Michael Fitzpatrick and Noelle Scaggs danced and flailed around for the entire hour as the band blasted through its high-octane tunes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cI want everybody to lose their [expletive] minds!\u201d Fitzpatrick roared, as the crowd \u2014 including several people in bulky Halloween costumes \u2014 tried to keep up. Playing the first of two sold-out concerts at the venue, it\u2019s fair to ask: Just where did these guys come from? The Los Angeles-based group broke out this year with bouncy alternative hit \u201c Out of My League \u201d and continued to gain steam with constant touring. Eventually the group got mainstream attention for its retro-soul throwback sound \u2014 featuring a heavy dose of saxophone \u2014 mixed with modern pop. Plus, their live show is captivatingly crazy. Scaggs, armed with a tambourine and some electric chemistry with Fitzpatrick, led the party as the high-energy songs quickly all started to blend together, making the whole set a blur. The momentum was broken only a few times, such as when Fitzpatrick set up the steamy \u201cHouse on Fire\u201d with a long, elaborate story about catching a partner cheating. But the crowd didn\u2019t seem to care about anecdotes \u2014 they just wanted to dance. Finale \u201cMoneyGrabber\u201d turned into the sort of scene you would see at a wedding when the DJ instructs guests to get \u201ca little bit softer now\u201d during \u201cShout\u201d as Fitzpatrick encouraged everyone to make their way to the floor and then leap back up in the air. L.A. pop duo Capital Cities, the openers/co-headliners, had little trouble pumping up the crowd thanks to their inescapable summer electro-pop jam \u201cSafe and Sound.\u201d Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian are former jingle writers who have seen their smash song infiltrate pop radio and, coincidentally, commercials. The pair occasionally broke into coordinated dance moves and performed about a dozen of their breezy, beat-heavy songs (\u201cKangaroo Court,\u201d \u201cCenter Stage,\u201d \u201cI Sold My Bed, but Not My Stereo\u201d). But it was trumpeter Spencer Ludwig who almost stole the show with his solos, adding a much-needed shot of unique energy to the electro-pop. Merchant and Simonian did their best to differentiate themselves from their pop peers, and some moments were legitimately strange. Introducing the deeply bizarre \u201cFarrah Fawcett Hair,\u201d Merchant proclaimed the song was about celebrating, \u201cThings in life that are undeniably good \u2014 like Nutella, and Daniel Day Lewis.\u201d And when the show appeared to be over, Merchant cautioned the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet, we want to dance with you guys.\u201d Sure enough, the guys dropped their instruments, a remix of \u201cSafe and Sound\u201d roared over the speakers, and they hit the stage to spastically groove along.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Emily Yahr", "wordCount": 472}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Midgette: Child opera singer goes viral, redux", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/33293d5c/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cclassical0Ebeat0Cpost0Cchild0Eopera0Esinger0Egoes0Eviral0Eredux0C20A130C10A0C310C63189d1a0E42690E11e30E8b740Ed89d714ca4dd0Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "In the popular imagination, opera arias have become a vehicle for\n\t\t\t\tall that is moving and beautiful \u2013 as long as they\u2019re not sung in an\n\t\t\t\topera house.

Dissociated from all\n\t\t\t\tvestiges of their original meaning or style, these arias have become\n\t\t\t\ta meme, a vehicle for a certain kind of popular\n\t\t\t\t crossover \n\t\t\t\t pseudo-operatic sound \n\t\t\t\t.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tIt happens every so often that\n\t\t\t\t one of these singers \n\t\t\t\t, singing one of these arias, strikes a chord in the popular\n\t\t\t\timagination and goes viral and becomes beloved of all but a handful\n\t\t\t\tof people like me who take on the role of sour-faced purists as we\n\t\t\t\ttry to explain that the singer in question is doing it all wrong and\n\t\t\t\tthe aria is capable of communicating\n\t\t\t\t so much more \n\t\t\t\twhen it is sung with real vocal technique and an actual\n\t\t\t\tunderstanding of the words.\n\t\t\t\t We \u201cpurists\u201d can get quite passionate about this \n\t\t\t\t, and many people come away from such diatribes with the idea that\n\t\t\t\twe are nasty people who enjoy being mean to little girls \u2013 except\n\t\t\t\tfor those who gleefully pile on and take our arguments even farther,\n\t\t\t\tclaiming that such performances represent the decline of art, taste,\n\t\t\t\tand even civilization. All of this stirs up such a tangle of comment\n\t\t\t\t\u2013 and comment is, today, a universal measure of success \u2013 that\n\t\t\t\t some people \n\t\t\t\tseem to go out of their way to invoke flashpoint names, like\n\t\t\t\t Jackie Evancho \n\t\t\t\t, whenever a chance presents itself. (Evancho, incidentally, also\n\t\t\t\tburst onto the scene with\n\t\t\t\t a performance of \u201cO\n\t\t\t\t\tmio babbino caro\u201d on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tToday\u2019s sensation, as the above video attests, is a 9-year-old girl\n\t\t\t\tnamed Amira Willighagen, who on the show Holland\u2019s Got Talent a few\n\t\t\t\tdays ago sang \u201cO mio babbino caro\u201d with all of the heart and soul a\n\t\t\t\tnine-year-old can muster and then some. How can I criticize this\n\t\t\t\tperformance? I can\u2019t criticize a little girl whose imagination was\n\t\t\t\tcaptivated enough by something about this music, or this song, that\n\t\t\t\tshe put the energy into learning it. I certainly can\u2019t speculate on\n\t\t\t\tthe involvement of her parents, though attributing malign motivation\n\t\t\t\tto\n\t\t\t\t putative stage\n\t\t\t\t\tparents \n\t\t\t\tis a common trope when\n\t\t\t\t these\n\t\t\t\t\tkinds of prodigy \n\t\t\t\tappear. I won\u2019t lecture the child on how she is sure to ruin her\n\t\t\t\tvoice if she sings in this particular way, because honestly, if she\n\t\t\t\tdoes care enough about singing eventually to pursue voice lessons,\n\t\t\t\tshe will figure out what she needs to do, and if she doesn\u2019t, it\n\t\t\t\tdoesn\u2019t really matter.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t I can observe, with curiosity, that this kind of deep-throated\n\t\t\t\tsinging, and precocious showmanship, appears to have a certain\n\t\t\t\tappeal to the prepubescent set; I don\u2019t know where it comes from,\n\t\t\t\tbut I think Jackie Evancho is more a symptom than a cause; I believe\n\t\t\t\tthere are a number of cases of little girls these days who work to\n\t\t\t\tmake sounds well beyond their years. I find it fascinating that this\n\t\t\t\tparticular aesthetic has enough appeal to reach young girls. We are\n\t\t\t\tconcerned, with abundant reason, about the hypersexualization to\n\t\t\t\twhich prepubescent girls are exposed, but learning opera arias at\n\t\t\t\ttoo early an age does not seem quite as sinister a manifestation of\n\t\t\t\tthis as skimpy clothes or lipstick or suggestive twerking poses in\n\t\t\t\tselfies. At least it shows an interest in music, albeit music as a\n\t\t\t\tvehicle: that is, when a nine-year-old perfectly mimes adult\n\t\t\t\tperformance, she is focusing on something slightly different than a\n\t\t\t\tnine-year-old who is working on her scales. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tSome of my opera-loving readers will chime in, at this juncture,\n\t\t\t\tthat this isn\u2019t music; that her phrasing is awful; that she, like so\n\t\t\t\tmany other singers, has turned one of the\n\t\t\t\t most enjoyably\n\t\t\t\t\tmanipulative comic arias in the repertory \n\t\t\t\tinto what she clearly believes opera is supposed to be: something\n\t\t\t\ttragic and passionate about love and death. (The aria\u2019s actual\n\t\t\t\tlyrics run along the lines of \u201cOh, dearest daddy, I so much want to\n\t\t\t\tmarry my boyfriend that if you don\u2019t let me buy a wedding ring I\u2019ll\n\t\t\t\tjump in the river, please let me daddy, pretty please,\u201d but the\n\t\t\t\tItalian words \u201cvorrei morir\u201d (I want to die) and \u201cpieta, pieta\u201d\n\t\t\t\t(have pity) tend to mislead non-Italian speakers into thinking the\n\t\t\t\tpiece is rather more dire than it is.) Well and good, but we\u2019ve\n\t\t\t\ttrodden this ground so many times before that there\u2019s almost no\n\t\t\t\tpoint in going into it again.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t For me, the most poignant thing about this video isn\u2019t the\n\t\t\t\tsinging, but the moment when the little girl finishes the aria and\n\t\t\t\tstands, almost shell-shocked, with a slightly dazed grin, in the\n\t\t\t\tstorm of applause. The moment documents a loss of innocence: the\n\t\t\t\tpoint at which your reflection in your bedroom mirror as you sing\n\t\t\t\tinto your hairbrush dissolves into a real-world crowd, shouting that\n\t\t\t\tthey want to hear you more. Amira Willighagen may be a flash in the\n\t\t\t\tpan, she may start giving stadium concerts, she may mature into a\n\t\t\t\twell-rounded artist; and whatever the world makes of her \u2013 and the\n\t\t\t\tcomments on the video have already started to draw up lines between\n\t\t\t\tthe \u201cinnocent angel\u201d and the \u201cruining her voice\u201d camps \u2013 is\n\t\t\t\teminently not her fault. But in the immediate future, her encounters\n\t\t\t\twith the world will be colored by the experience of this first,\n\t\t\t\trapturous reception.", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Today in tacos: TaKorean to Yards Park; Tacos Impala tests \u2018Impalocas\u2019, Markham\u2019s Bar and Grill opens today in Bethesda", "wordCount": 962}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Chris Thile gives Strathmore crowd a thrilling performance", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636576/s/3328e2d8/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cchris0Ethile0Egives0Estrathmore0Ecrowd0Ea0Ethrilling0Eperformance0C20A130C10A0C310C122cd1fa0E424b0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Imusic/story01.htm", "text": "Let it be known: Chris Thile is amazing.

The concert\u2019s centerpiece and bookends were solo violin works of Bach, the G Minor Sonata and the B Minor Partita, which Thile recently recorded. It was neither a transcription nor arrangement, since the mandolin is tuned identically to the violin; it was simply the music plucked rather than bowed. Given the extreme complexity of the pieces, Thile\u2019s note-perfect renditions were delivered with considerably less freedom and energy than his closer-to-home material.

Her show at the Lincoln Theatre on Wednesday \u2014 supporting her sixth studio album, \u201c The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You \u201d \u2014 was subdued, colored by distinctly autumnal and reflective tones. Playing the first of two consecutive nights at the historic U Street venue, Case fronted a lithe, shape-shifting backing quartet that she pushed through the set with an efficiency that was workmanlike at times. Perhaps that was due in part to the chest cold she has been trying to shake for more than a week, but in cranking through 20-plus songs, the banter with sidekick Kelly Hogan was kept to a minimum, and the songs stood squarely in the spotlight. The pensive mood cast by the opening \u201cWhere Did I Leave That Fire\u201d (\u201cI saw my shadow looking lost, checking its pockets for some lost receipt\u201d) hardly lifted during the nearly 80-minute set, though Case and Hogan\u2019s harmonies soared over and across the melodies as gorgeously as ever. In addition to longtime vocal partner and stage foil Hogan, the band was anchored by stalwart guitarist Jon Rauhouse and bassist Tom V. Ray, who bent sympathetically to a set of songs mainly drawn from Case\u2019s three most recent studio albums. There were a few exceptions \u2014 notably a rousing version of \u201cThe Tigers Have Spoken\u201d and a nervy take on one of her best songs, \u201cSet Out Running.\u201d The core of the set was in beautiful and wistful compositions such as \u201cCity Swans,\u201d \u201cThe Pharaohs,\u201d \u201cLion\u2019s Jaws,\u201d \u201cThe Next Time You Say Forever\u201d and \u201cCalling Cards.\u201d Case swept through these mid-tempo numbers with easy grace, glancing occasionally at Rauhouse, who spun shimmering figures that cast her vocals in sharp relief.

He was 84 and resided in Silver Spring. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t He had prostate cancer, his wife, Sylvia Morgan, said. Since his arrival in Washington in 1960, Mr. Morgan had a long and steady career as a pianist in nightclubs, hotels and concert halls, including Blues Alley and the Kennedy Center. He recorded more than a dozen albums and performed over the years with many top singers and musicians, including Etta Jones, Joe Williams and Keter Betts. He was known as a versatile, crowd-pleasing pianist who could embellish a large repertoire of tunes with improvised flourishes that reminded many listeners of piano stars Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner. \u201cDick showed you that jazz is fun,\u201d David Einhorn, Mr. Morgan\u2019s bass player for 17 years, said Wednesday in an interview. \u201cDick was a guy who could bring you to tears and make you laugh and make you bounce in your seat, all in one song.\u201d In the mid-1950s, when Mr. Morgan was working in Norfolk, the trombonist and bandleader Tommy Dorsey invited him to join his group in Las Vegas. The job was cut short when Dorsey died in 1956. During his time in Las Vegas, Mr. Morgan performed at a birthday party for Frank Sinatra, with Sinatra singing along with him. By the late 1950s, Mr. Morgan had returned to Norfolk, where he often worked with Virginia-born guitarist Charlie Byrd, who helped launch the bossa nova craze of the 1960s. Byrd helped bring Mr. Morgan to Washington, where he was soon leading a trio at the old Showboat Lounge in Adams Morgan. Saxophonist Julian \u201cCannonball\u201d Adderley, then at the height of his fame, was so bowled over by what he heard from Mr. Morgan that he called his record label. Within a week, a recording crew came to Washington to capture Mr. Morgan in a live album, \u201cDick Morgan at the Showboat\u201d (1960). His drummer on the recording, Bertell Knox, continued to work with Mr. Morgan for more than 50 years. \u201cI don\u2019t make any claims to be a first-class jazz pianist,\u201d Mr. Morgan told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in 2007. \u201cI\u2019m somebody that will immediately get immersed in the audience and get them to pay attention. That has carried me through the years. I play for the audiences \u2014 I don\u2019t play for me.\u201d Richard Lewis Morgan was born June 5, 1929, in Petersburg, Va. By the time he was 5, he could play hymns from memory \u2014 after his mother had played them just once on the pump organ at his family\u2019s home. Largely self-taught on piano, Mr. Morgan had his own radio show in Petersburg when he was 10.\u2009He learned mostly from older musicians passing through nearby Fort Lee, Va., and had a early encounter with bandleader Duke Ellington, who encouraged his budding career. Mr. Morgan attended Virginia State University and played in an Army combo in the early 1950s. He often had extended hotel and club engagements in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada and Puerto Rico, but Mr. Morgan became a Washington fixture, with long residences at the Top of the Town in Arlington, Pirate\u2019s Hideaway in Georgetown and, more recently, the Madison Hotel in downtown D.C. In 1997, a Washington Post critic praised Mr. Morgan\u2019s album \u201cAfter Hours,\u201d noting that he \u201ctaps into the essence of the blues\u201d and \u201can engagingly blue mood envelops the listener, thanks to his rippling tremolos and leisurely paced turnarounds.\u201d Mr. Morgan\u2019s final recording, the solo album \u201cBewitched,\u201d was released in 2010. He gave his last performance in April. His first marriage, to the former Lois Josephine Fountain, ended in divorce. He was predeceased by a son from an earlier relationship, James Morgan, and a stepson, Roland Everett. Survivors include his wife of 44 years, Sylvia Everett Morgan of Silver Spring; a daughter from his first marriage, Anita M. Harris-Jones of Norfolk; a stepdaughter, L. Verlon Colwell of Washington; seven grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren; and five great-great-grandchildren. When he was approaching 50, Mr. Morgan returned to college at the behest of a friend, comedian Bill Cosby, and graduated in 1979 from the Washington program of Antioch College. He received a law degree from Howard University in 1983 but never pursued a legal career, preferring to stay at the piano. \u201cHe really touched audiences because of how he understood the music and how he could convey what the music was saying,\u201d Steve Abshire, his guitarist for the past 29 years, said Wednesday. \u201cHe had a way of communicating the music that went straight to the heart.\u201d", "topics": ["entertainment", "music"], "author": "Matt Schudel", "wordCount": 767}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "TV highlights for Nov. 4: \u2018Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 returns", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636699/s/33435102/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Ctv0Ehighlights0Efor0Enov0E40Ereal0Ehousewives0Eof0Ebeverly0Ehills0Ereturns0C20A130C110C0A30C0A96cd8160E419d0E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itv/story01.htm", "text": "Robin and Loretta\u2019s feud escalates, and Barney\u2019s caught in the middle on \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d (CBS at 8 p.m.).

In \u201cIndifference,\u201d we say goodbye to Carol, not in a bloody battle, but behind the wheel of an old station wagon as she drives away after being cast out of the prison community by Rick.  Carol has transformed from the scared, battered and weak character she was in season one to someone numb to violence, pain or fear. Carol was cold and calculating when she murdered Karen and David, she tells Rick, because it was what she thought she needed to do to save lives. \u201cIt\u2019s about facing reality,\u201d she says of her decision. Carol shows Rick her hardened side once again while out on a run for supplies. She is somewhat indifferent after meeting a nice, young couple hiding in one of the suburban homes. The couple \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 does not survive the episode, and Carol barely bats an eye. She\u2019s seen too many people die, including her daughter, to care that much anymore. Carol has become a shadow of her past self, and Rick does not like it. They seem to fundamentally disagree on issues of survival and morality, making Rick genuinely afraid of letting Carol be near his children. Rick also knows the reality of what Carol faces if Tyreese finds out about the murders. How the past has shaped the current cast of survivors plays a big part in this week\u2019s episode. Rick and Carol discuss everything from Carol\u2019s struggle with her abusive husband to Lori\u2019s habit of making pancakes every Sunday for Rick and Carl. After last week\u2019s car troubles, Michonne, Tyreese, Daryl and Bob stumble upon an abandoned gas station and work to revive a vehicle. Bob and Daryl discuss the groups Bob used to travel with while Michonne tries to coach Tyreese through his anger regarding Karen\u2019s death. After starting the car and quickly gathering supplies at the veterinary hospital, Bob\u2019s battle with alcoholism (first hinted at in the store raid from the season premiere), almost derails their successful trip. This season, the survivors are coming to terms with who they are, who they\u2019ve become and how it affects their actions. For Carol, it now means facing survival alone. \n\n Romance report: Besides seeing another lovely couple die at the hands of walkers, not much to report here. \n\n Unanswered questions: Is this the last we\u2019ll see of Carol?

And right now, she is not entirely enjoying it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time feeling good about all this,\u201d she says, with a half-laugh, \u201cuntil the first episode is on.\u201d  Sugar sounds so calm and confident, though, that she belies this case of show-biz nerves. Yet the moment must be noted. By following her artistic passion from Silver Spring to Hollywood, Sugar has become something of a trailblazer. On Monday evening, Cartoon Network will debut its newest program, \u201c Steven Universe ,\u201d officially making Sugar, at just 26, the first woman to be a solo show creator in the channel\u2019s 21 years on the air. She is thrilled to achieve the breakthrough, but with just days until the debut, she\u2019s not focused on being the first female creator \u2014 she\u2019s too busy simply being a creator, with plenty to still decide and coordinate. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a whirlwind,\u201d Sugar, a veteran of Cartoon Network\u2019s popular \u201c Adventure Time ,\u201d says of steering her own show to launch. \u201cBut I feel more ready than if I hadn\u2019t made so many independent comics and done so many films.\u201d Everything, in other words, feels as if it\u2019s been naturally leading to this opportunity. From that, the animator draws confidence. Sugar\u2019s creative vision, after all, wasn\u2019t just born at Cartoon Network\u2019s studios in Burbank, Calif. Her dream to do precisely what she\u2019s now doing was launched many years ago, a coast and an ocean away, back home in Montgomery County. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait for someone to give you a show,\u201d says Sugar. She\u2019s long been an ambitious artist who regularly attended Baltimore Comic-Con and Maryland\u2019s Small Press Expo to listen and learn from luminaries while also getting professional feedback on her portfolio. \u201cThat can\u2019t be the first time you\u2019re writing and drawing a character.\u201d Sugar summons inspiration from characters she has created since childhood. \u201cSteven Universe\u201d may appear to be an action-fantasy cartoon about gem-powered superheroes, but beneath the bright tints and battle scenes, the show plays like an ode to Sugar\u2019s artistically supportive upbringing in Sligo Park Hills. The program is even named for her younger brother, Steven \u2014 who is a background artist on the show. \u201cI realized, while working on the show, that it\u2019s not what I thought it was going to be about. It\u2019s about how much I needed emotional support in high school \u2014 just with little things, going through tough times, high school teen angst,\u201d says Sugar, who simultaneously attended Montgomery Blair High and the Visual Arts Center at Einstein High. \u201cMy brother would just be hanging out with me, not having to say anything. If I ever felt weird around friends, Steven would always be there. I felt that would never change.\u201d Sugar stops herself, joking that she should move on to another topic before she gets verklempt. \u201cAw, that\u2019s nice of her to say!\u201d Steven Sugar, 23, replies to his sister\u2019s sentiment. \u201cWe spent a lot of time together as kids watching cartoons, playing video games and drawing. We\u2019d brainstorm ideas for comics together, run ideas past each other and get critiques \u2014 all of which sort of set the groundwork for what [we\u2019re] doing now.\u201d   In the new show, three female superheroes named for their gem-related powers \u2014 Amethyst, Garnet and Pearl \u2014 are shepherding irrepressible Steven, an ever-smiling boy who hasn\u2019t yet discovered his gem power. Rebecca says that to write each character, she thinks about how she interacts with her brother \u2014 from the laid-back Amethyst to the authoritative Garnet. (As for having his name in the title, Steven says: \u201cIt\u2019s always been a bit surreal, and a bit flattering, too.\u201d) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cSteven Universe\u201d is set in the fictitious Beach City, but the locale \u201cis rather significantly inspired by the beaches Rebecca and I visited when we were kids,\u201d says Steven \u2014 who also attended Einstein\u2019s Visual Arts Center before going to the Rhode Island School of Design. \u201cThere are a few not-so-subtle references to Rehoboth Beach in there. The whole town is a sort of amalgam of Rehoboth, Bethany and Dewey.  \u201cI find it pretty cool,\u201d he continues, \u201cthat so much of the non-magical side of the show comes from something so grounded in reality.\u201d The Sugar parents were both animation fans and always creatively supportive. Rebecca began attending North Bethesda\u2019s Small Press Expo at age 15 and exhibited her own work there by 21. (\u201cI sold a couple of books and loved being there.\u201d) She grew her animation talents at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, where she connected with people who would lead her to become an artist on Pendleton Ward\u2019s \u201cAdventure Time\u201d \u2014 which in just a few seasons has become a huge success for Cartoon Network. Ward is a fan. \u201cRebecca is so caring and empathetic with her characters. She respects them and isn\u2019t cynical with how she writes for them, which makes her characters more real, more genuine, which, I think lets her audience fall deeply into the world that she\u2019s creating,\u201d he says of Sugar. At \u201cAdventure Time,\u201d Sugar story\u00adboarded some of the show\u2019s most memorable episodes, and became known to fans, too, for her scripted musical interludes (she plays ukulele and hammered dulcimer). From there, she seems to have moved easily into her new role. \u201cAs far as being a good boss, she has a lot of respect for her crew,\u201d her brother says. \u201cShe puts a lot of trust in everyone to bring something personal to the show. It seems to me that really helps foster a creative studio environment.\u201d With just days until the premiere, any trepidation appears to fall away when asked to share the best lessons she\u2019s learned so far. How should young artists seek a break, let alone a historic breakthrough? \u201cDon\u2019t wait to get permission, and don\u2019t worry about it not being good,\u201d says Sugar, her voice gathering with conviction. \u201c\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009. \u00a0Make it as good as you can and keep moving on. Don\u2019t be afraid to make stuff now. You have to start immediately .\u201d Spoken like someone poised to shake up her \u201cUniverse.\u201d \n Steven Universe \n \n \n (30 minutes) premieres Monday at 8\u00a0p.m. on Cartoon Network.", "topics": ["entertainment", "tv"], "author": "Michael Cavna", "wordCount": 1018}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "TV highlights: The Atlanta \u2018Housewives\u2019 are back", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636699/s/3333d7b2/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Ctv0Ehighlights0Ethe0Eatlanta0Ehousewives0Eare0Eback0C20A130C110C0A10Caf13b9360E41860E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itv/story01.htm", "text": "Boston lawyer Mary Ross inherits a house in Plymouth, Mass., from her late aunt in \u201cThe Thanksgiving House\u201d (Hallmark at 8 p.m.), but without her knowing it, the house turns out to be a historic landmark.

I feel like I just binged on all my favorite candy and one or two pieces I didn\u2019t like. Now I\u2019m crashing from the sugar and my parents just told me I can\u2019t have any more candy until next Thursday.  This week\u2019s episode started out perfectly for me because admitting you have a problem is always the first step, right? Olivia\u2019s at dinner with Papa Pope and he sassily points out that his daughter hasn\u2019t yet accused him \u201cof any crimes against humanity.\u201d Love his maniacal laugh! Olivia counters with a heaping dose of know thyself and reminds her father of his propensity toward power moves.. \u201cSo, instead of speaking my mind, instead of being the brave outspoken girl my mother taught me to be, I\u2019m chewing my food. I\u2019m fulfilling my contract.\u201d Well, girl, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to say it . You haven\u2019t been very gladiator-esque lately. I feel like Olivia\u2019s finally getting some of her grit back, a few Fitz-related poutyfaces notwithstanding. When Josephine Marcus, the Democratic congresswoman from last week\u2019s episode, comes to Olivia seeking help with her secret baby (now a 30-year-old woman), Liv knows just what to do. She dispatches her associates to Montana, to find (and bury) all the related dirt they can find. Also in Montana: Ethan, the White House staffer known for retrieving Cyrus\u2019s soup and reminding us that it can never get cold. Ethan is no match for the gladiators, however restless they may be. Huck is preoccupied with helping his new BFF, Jake, uncover Fitz\u2019s role in Operation Remington, Quinn is focused on living up to her Baby Huck-ness, while Abby marinates over David\u2019s request that she be his date to the White House Correspondents Dinner. Dabby + Nerd Prom = All the feelings! Harrison is Olivia-by-proxy, but he does also seem a little preoccupied...with Dabby. Hmmm. No judgement, Harrison. Team Fitz still \u201cgot Poped\u201d (point, Ethan). And to be honest, I was preoccupied with the taxidermy. Back in Washington, sidekicks Mellie and Cyrus try to convince someone who sounds a lot like season one Olivia Pope to come and work for Fitz\u2019s campaign. After some real talk and a firm no, Cy reaches out to his old friend Liv, who is undermining Cyrus and his Team Fitz efforts on behalf of her latest client. I loved Cyrus\u2019s genuine horror as he told Mellie: \u201cI gave her a world class education in the dark arts!\u201d Mellie and Cyrus weren\u2019t the only ones teaming up for a cause. Jake and Huck had some great exchanges, though Jake wins hands down for \u201cwere you even in B613?\u201d Burn. Jake also calls Olivia out about her Fitz Phone (is it just me or is that thing an actual flip phone?) and we learn that Olivia always vetted Fitz\u2019s WHCD jokes , waah. When Olivia and Fitz finally spoke on said phone, she encouraged him to take all of his moral shortcomings and \u201cdive in. own it.\u201d it was easily the most annoying, adolescent exchange of the episode. Fitz: \u201cI\u2019m hiding from Mellie in the bathroom.\u201d (like, totally) Olivia: \u201dI just dug the phone out of the trash.\u201d (O.M.G.) This episode was truly a Tale of Two Olivias \u2014 and the levelheaded one proved that her gut still worked as Josephine realized Olivia would not steer her wrong. I\u2019m liking Lisa Kudrow\u2019s arc enough to not bring up Smellycat (whoops). The other Olivia, the one who is gaga for Fitz, takes Jake to the Correspondents Dinner. He feels used (and he is), but would you look at that dress? And the strut that goes with it? I liked Jake even more when he told Olivia he wouldn\u2019t \u201cplay second fiddle to anyone, not even the president.\u201d The president, it should be noted, makes some jokes that are beyond uncomfortable given Mellie\u2019s presence. Ironic that she would be the person willing to play second fiddle. Our first lady puts her pride aside and begs Olivia to come and work for Fitz\u2019s campaign. It's always right when you find someone new that your old flames come crawling back. Am I right? While everyone was courting Olivia, sadly, our Dabby date was foiled. But how sweet was it when they finally discussed the reason? And how gorgeous was Abby\u2019s pale green gown? This dinner sure seemed short and devoid of afterparties . By the end, Huck thinks he\u2019s discovered Fitz\u2019s role in Operation Remington, one that means that the president himself is responsible for the death of Olivia\u2019s mother. How will the writers of \u201cScandal\u201d play this? Will we think Fitz killed Olivia\u2019s mom for several episodes only to learn that he didn\u2019t or that she\u2019s still alive? I wish I could say I have no problem with waiting until next week, but I have to admit it: I\u2019m waiting with bated breath. Parents: Where did you hide the candy? Hey, at least I owned it. \n\n Lingering questions : What is Baby Huck planning to do with that gun? Will Olivia choose to work for Josephine or Fitz?

Funerals are more casual, celebratory in tone \u2014 with biographical videos, favorite pop songs and even a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses worn by the deceased. Cremation is becoming a more popular and affordable option, dramatically shifting the definition of a final resting place. And enough of us now know first-hand that real angels and heroes work in the fields of hospice and palliative care. I rarely insist that anybody watch anything on TV, but I strongly recommend that you watch as much as you can of \u201cTime of Death,\u201d Showtime\u2019s unflinchingly honest docu-series (premiering Friday night) about what it\u2019s like to die \u2014 and what it\u2019s like for our loved ones to watch us go. I get that it\u2019s not going to be a TV show for all. It\u2019s hard stuff. If you and your loved ones are planning to live forever then, by all means, skip it. If, on the other hand, you are an adult with a firm grip on reality (and perhaps faith), you will likely find yourself transfixed by the gentle and elegant ways that \u201cTime of Death\u201d takes us into the final weeks of eight women and men, ages 19 to 78, each losing a fight against a terminal illness. Conceived and produced by some of the same people behind \u201cProject Runway\u201d and \u201cTop Chef,\u201d \u201cTime of Death\u201d bears the dignified, documentary-style traits that reality TV had in its earliest days: It is desperately interested in observing people up-close, as they are, and will not turn away when things get too real. It has a deep well of empathy that is unclouded by saccharine attempts at sympathy. The producers don\u2019t try to guide what\u2019s happening into narrative convenience. All the show has to do is wait patiently for its subjects to die. Remarkably, this doesn\u2019t feel intrusive. When death comes in each of the six episodes, it often feels like a beautiful release of stress for the dying person as well as for family and friends. And, in an almost profound way, for the viewer. The series\u2019s main through-line focuses on 48-year-old Maria Lencioni, a free-spirited single mom in Santa Cruz, Calif., who is facing the final stages of breast cancer. Maria\u2019s story continues through each episode as she attempts a final round of chemotherapy and as her adult daughter, Nicole, prepares to take custody of Maria\u2019s miscreant teenagers. It quickly becomes clear that Nicole isn\u2019t ready to be a parent to her half-siblings; one of Maria\u2019s last acts, heartbreakingly, is to put the teens in foster care. Although the drama in Maria\u2019s household would at first seem to stray from \u201cTime of Death\u2019s\u201d trajectory toward deathbed scenes, it is very much in tune with the show\u2019s real goal of showing how families will \u2014 and sometimes stubbornly won\u2019t \u2014 come together when a loved one nears the end. Laura Kovarik, 63, also at the end stage of breast cancer, embarks on a road trip from Long Beach, Calif., to Colorado Springs, accompanied by her single daughter (and care provider) Lisa. Laura hopes the drive will rekindle happy memories of family car trips and frequent stops at tourist traps, but after the first day, her energy flags. Meanwhile, Lisa must deal with resentment toward her older sister, Laura\u2019s other daughter, who keeps death and the family discord at arm\u2019s length. There are others: A 47-year-old former mixed-martial arts fighter is paralyzed by ALS, but reunites with his estranged mother and the two sons that he never knew. He goes out with calm acceptance and a sharp sense of humor expressed in the robotic voice of his special computer. We also meet a 75-year-old grandmother and psychotherapist (who specialized in grief and death issues) as she throws herself a farewell party before the end in order to tell everyone how much she loves them. In more than one episode, as the subjects began \u201cactively dying\u201d (in hospice parlance), the families who participated in \u201cTime of Death\u201d shut the bedroom door or asked the cameras to wait outside. The hesitation is understandable and yet vaguely disappointing. In still another episode, neither the camera nor the family members were present when the subject died; the camera is instead there when a relative arrives and discovers that this person died alone. Most movingly, in episode 6, we meet Nicolle Kissee, a 19-year-old skin cancer patient whose swift decline left her in a fog of pain. Her younger sisters hover on the periphery; one is simply too frightened to join the family in Nicolle\u2019s bedroom when the time comes. The Kissee family is the most open and expressive with their love and grief as they \u2014 and we \u2014 say goodbye to their daughter. I watched all the episodes consecutively and came away exhausted, but I also came away with a sense of comfort that I still can\u2019t quite describe. It was gratitude, in part, to the subjects and their families for letting the cameras in. \u201cTime of Death\u201d is vital and meaningful television; if you watch, I hope it gives you the same peace and understanding it gave me. \n Time of Death \n \n \n (one hour) premieres at Friday at 9 p.m. on Showtime.", "topics": ["entertainment", "tv"], "author": "Hank Stuever", "wordCount": 901}, {"date": "2013-10-30 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "\u2018The Returned\u2019: A morose, mesmerizing tale that offers a new twist on the living dead", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636699/s/331c8407/sc/36/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Cthe0Ereturned0Ea0Emorose0Emesmerizing0Etale0Ethat0Eoffers0Ea0Enew0Etwist0Eon0Ethe0Eliving0Edead0C20A130C10A0C30A0C97b0A160Aa0E3b630E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itv/story01.htm", "text": "When you are French, the return of the living dead provokes more of an existential crisis than a full-blown panic. Oh, it\u2019s you, person-who-died-10-years-ago \u2014 bonjour. Sit, talk. Would you like a cigarette? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t In writer/director Fabrice Gobert\u2019s hauntingly effective and highly original eight-part miniseries \u201cThe Returned,\u201d which begins Thursday night on Sundance Channel, a few deceased residents suddenly come back to their quiet mountain town in the Rhone-Alps region, but not with the slow, shuffling menace we\u2019ve come to equate (and frankly overdo) with zombies. These dead are rejuvenated at the age and appearance they were when their loved ones last saw them \u2014 four years ago or even 35 years ago. Not a scratch on them (yet). Among the first is Camille (Yara Pilartz), an introspective 15-year-old who died in a tragic bus plunge on a school field trip. Although she is supposed to be buried in the town cemetery, she walks home from the ravine where she died, fixes a snack, draws herself a bath and wonders who\u2019s been messing with the things in her bedroom \u2014 to the utter astonishment of her mother, Claire (Anne Consigny). It\u2019s deeply upsetting for the rest of the family, too, particularly Camille\u2019s rebellious twin sister, Lena (Jenna Thiam), who is now 19. After the screaming and crying, what is the family supposed to do? They don\u2019t tell a soul, except Claire\u2019s self-absorbed pastor (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Sivadier), who pronounces Camille\u2019s return a miracle. Now the issue is how to explain Camille\u2019s reappearance to the other parents who lost children in the accident. \n\n \u201cThe Returned\u201d was a hit when it aired in France in late 2012 (as \u201cLes Revenants,\u201d very loosely based on a 2004 film of the same name). It is a uniquely rendered creep show that specializes in meaningful silences, emotional stress and dour moods. In so doing, it takes its place among recent miniseries that artfully elude their genres, including \u201c Top of the Lake \u201d and \u201c Rectify ,\u201d which both aired on Sundance this year , and even \u201c In the Flesh \u201d and the excellent \u201c Broadchurch \u201d on BBC America . As with \u201cBroadchurch,\u201d I recommend \u201cThe Returned\u201d only for those viewers who are prepared for its uncomfortable exploration of death, grief and, in this case, eerie occurrences of resurrection. (\u201cWas Jesus considered a ghost when he came back?\u201d a confused policeman asks a local priest.) \u201cThe Returned\u201d exists somewhere between a horror story and an act of magical thinking; its premise is simply not for everyone. It\u2019s also in French, with subtitles. Man, is it French \u2014 in the most stylish, morose and occasionally aloof ways. Episode by episode, \u201cThe Returned\u201d unravels, savors and even overthinks its central mysteries: Why are these people back? What happens now? Its pace is purposefully slow \u2014 the kind of slow we just don\u2019t do in America anymore, especially when it comes to the walking dead. Despite the plodding, you may find yourself on the edge of your seat anyhow. Along with Camille, there is Victor (Swann Nambotin), a little boy who won\u2019t speak after he follows home a physician, Julie (C\u00e9line Sallette), who takes him in. And Simon (Pierre Perrier), a brooding young man who searches for his fiancee (Clotilde Hesme), who, in the decade since Simon killed himself, has raised their young daughter and is about to marry the local police captain (Samir Guesmi). There\u2019s also the return of a deceased serial attacker who stalked women as they were walking home at night. What will happen to these undead? What if their loved ones have moved on and don\u2019t welcome them back? And why is the nearby dam leaking? And why did the Bambi critters in the local forest rush to drown themselves in the lake? \u201cThe Returned\u201d is so beautiful to look at that it\u2019s easy to miss its shortcomings, particularly as it nears the finish. Although this incredible event has happened to the townspeople, the show takes a tad too long to connect its many plot threads; like most stylish Euro-mysteries, it has a habit of raising more questions than it can ever answer. Some scenes are redundant, which means viewers are likely to peel off before the final episode, which is where \u201cThe Returned\u201d begins to resemble something we\u2019d commonly recognize as a zombie film. Even then, it\u2019s more sad than terrifying. \n The Returned \n \n \n (Les Revenants) \n \n \n (first of eight parts) premieres Thursday at 9 p.m. on Sundance Channel.", "topics": ["entertainment", "tv"], "author": "Hank Stuever", "wordCount": 729}, {"date": "2013-10-29 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "TV highlights: An intimate look at over-exposed Ke$ha", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636699/s/33116b2e/sc/8/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Ctv0Ehighlights0Ean0Eintimate0Elook0Eat0Eover0Eexposed0Ekeha0C20A130C10A0C290Cdb40A7c0A0A0E3fe30E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itv/story01.htm", "text": "The Glades goes gun crazy when a man who calls himself \u201cThe Mayor\u201d brings in illegal artillery on \u201cArrow\u201d (CW at 8 p.m.).

It\u2019s flu season for the prison-dwelling survivors in \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d too. This week, we find out just how dangerous the super-flu is that turned Patrick into a zombie. The bug is suddenly running amok in the prison, and at this point, everyone is at risk of exposure. Sasha falls ill, Glenn falls ill, and even little Lizzie is sick and sent into quarantine. The desperate situation calls for antibiotics, and Hershel knows a local veterinary college 50 miles away has what they need. Daryl leads the charge on the trip, recruiting Michonne and Bob to join him. Even Tyreese, who desperately wants to bring Karen\u2019s killer to justice and has a sick sister to worry about, decides to join. The group fails to make it to their destination after being confronted by a mob of walkers on the road. The group tries to reverse the car but gets stuck atop a pile of walkers. (Any fans of exploding zombie heads should have enjoyed that scene). Fleeing the car, Tyreese is seemingly overrun and left behind, but eventually emerges through the woods behind Daryl, Michonne and Bob. Rick chooses to stay behind from the road trip to keep an eye on Carl and take the lead on finding Karen\u2019s assailant. He discovers that Carol is the killer after comparing the size of his handprint with that of a bloody handprint at the scene of the crime. Rick asks her point blank if she burned Karen and David, another prison member, alive, and she calmly admits to it. We\u2019ve come to love and respect Carol for her unwavering loyalty to the group when it comes to teaching the children and helping run operations and meals. But that loyalty apparently runs deep enough to lead her to think she could protect the group by killing Karen and David. Hershel also reveals his unfaltering allegiance in this episode. He knows he may have already been exposed to the flu and decides to try and help the ailing survivors at the risk of his own health. After venturing out to the woods to collect elderberry, sporting his trademark sheriff\u2019s hat with Carol in tow, Hershel enters the quarantined area to make tea for the sick. Despite pleading from Maggie, he exposes himself to the flu. \u201cListen,\u201d Hershel says to Maggie. \u201cYou step outside, you risk your life. You take a sip of water, you risk your life. Every moment now, you risk your life. You don\u2019t have a choice. You can only choose what you\u2019re risking it for. I can help them feel better. I can save lives. That\u2019s reason enough to risk mine and you know that.\u201d \n\n Romance report: Not much but more sad developments here. Maggie is clearly distraught over Glenn and then watches her father sacrifice his health to help the group. \n\n Unanswered questions: Will our group out on the hunt for antibiotics make it back to the camp alive? It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen such a large mass of walkers attack. And who was the voice they heard over the airwaves on the car radio on the way to the veterinary college?

Although it bears the imprimatur of HBO\u2019s parody-averse documentary division, much of the film (airing Monday night) feels somewhat akin to the work of Christopher Guest or perhaps that of a couple of very well-connected Borats. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The productively nutso film director James Toback and the predictably talky actor Alec Baldwin are in cahoots here, jetting off with a camera crew to the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. They\u2019ve come to pitch deep-pocketed investors on a movie idea they call \u201cLast Tango in Tikrit,\u201d in homage to Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s 1972 film \u201c Last Tango in Paris ,\u201d only with the Iraq war as a backdrop and with Baldwin playing the Marlon Brando role. They want to see if they can convince anyone to give them tens of millions of dollars to make it happen. If it\u2019s even partly a put-on, \u201cSeduced and Abandoned\u201d is nevertheless a fun, larky travel essay and commentary on the film biz, an exquisite wallow in the most rarefied sort of first-world problems. By following Toback and Baldwin on this half-cocked notion, we get to see what Cannes looks like from the A-list viewpoint, along with a history of what the film festivalused to be juxtaposed with the publicity circus it\u2019s become. (Baldwin reveals early on that not only has he never been to Cannes, he\u2019s never been to the French Riviera before this.) In a playful act of sabotage, Toback is initially set on \u201990s TV ingenue Neve Campbell to star opposite Baldwin (the two men are seen wooing Campbell and essentially promising her the role before they leave for France), but, to no one\u2019s surprise, the investors aren\u2019t thrilled with her marquee value. And while everyone\u2019s being honest, they aren\u2019t exactly thrilled with Baldwin\u2019s, either, at least not in a sexually charged feature film. So Toback and Baldwin dig in for long sessions of schmoozing, gabbing, noshing. They meet up with Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, Mike Medavoy, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Francis Ford Coppola, among others. To a person, these luminaries are all willing to have a serious conversation about the filmmaking craft, but the more earnestly they talk, the more it seems like they\u2019re the victims of a prank. Things get more awkward when Toback and Baldwin make their pitches to younger, hotter movie actors to see if they might like to star in \u201cLast Tango in Tikrit.\u201d In media-day mode, Jessica Chastain takes time for a confused, if effusive, quickie conversation about her approach to acting, while an unflappable Ryan Gosling seems to get the meta-joke exactly, if there\u2019s a joke here to be had. There are a lot of jokes to be had. Toback and Baldwin are well-practiced at riffs and ironic attempts at self-deprecation, even aboard yachts. No one loves to hear the sound of his own voice more than Alec Baldwin, and no one should love to hear the sound of his own voice more than Alec Baldwin. While he lays on the charm and fritters away a mere fraction of his celebrity capital (what\u2019s in your wallet?), it\u2019s up to Toback to ditch good manners and ask directly for cash commitments. At 95 minutes in length, \u201cSeduced and Abandoned\u201d stretches the limits of how fascinating it is to watch actors, directors and billionaires blow smoke up one another\u2019s derrieres, but this is Cannes, where everyone expects it. I remain unconvinced that the pair was trying to make any movie besides this spoofy documentary. But stripped down to its essential message, \u201cSeduced and Abandoned\u201d is a futile open letter to Hollywood and a fancy way of expressing the heartbreak we all encounter in our chosen professions \u2014 Toback and Baldwin just happened to choose the film industry, which, as Baldwin repeatedly says, is especially crushing. \u201cYou are seduced and abandoned over and over again,\u201d he tells one journalist. Such verite moments abound: While Toback and Baldwin beg for money, they also give interviews to the foreign media, creating a mood of crossed wires and lost translations. Nobody quite understands anybody else\u2019s enthusiasm for the magic that may potentially lurk in a movie deal, but everyone understands the letdown. \n Seduced and Abandoned \n \n \n (95 minutes) airs Monday at 9 p.m. \n \n \n on HBO, with encores.", "topics": ["entertainment", "tv"], "author": "Hank Stuever", "wordCount": 697}, {"date": "2013-10-25 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "TV highlights: A three-part Civil War retrospective", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636699/s/32ed5f61/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Ctv0Ehighlights0Ea0Ethree0Epart0Ecivil0Ewar0Eretrospective0C20A130C10A0C250Cc84f27840E3c20A0E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itv/story01.htm", "text": "When hotel event planner Rachel breaks up with her cheating boyfriend, she decides to start Internet dating in \n \u201cThe Husband She Met Online\u201d \n (Lifetime at 8 p.m. Saturday).

It doesn\u2019t mean I dishonor \u201cThe Good Wife\u2019s\u201d accolades in real time; seasons come and seasons go and its quality never wavers, especially when it comes to broadcast network shows. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t So now that Walt is done and the zombies appear to be walking in circles , it\u2019s a perfect time to renew vows this Sunday with Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and her zany world of billable hours, litigious social-networkers and Illinois state politics.  As faithful viewers already know, this episode has been a long time coming: Alicia and her once-rival Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) are discovered in the act of starting their own law firm. Each promptly gets a security escort out of the Lockhart Gardner offices, where the remaining partners now scramble to keep clients from being wooed by the fledgling Florrick Agos. In this deliciously venomous and rollicking episode (title: \u201cHitting the Fan\u201d), so much of what \u201cGood Wife\u201d devotees have desired (and feared) comes to pass. How can Alicia so fully betray the confidence of her friend, mentor and occasional lover, Will Gardner (Josh Charles)? How can she leave behind the uncannily resourceful Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi)? What will become of Diane Lockhart\u2019s (Christine Baranski) state supreme court nomination? Without revealing anything, I\u2019ll simply pause to admire \u201cThe Good Wife\u2019s\u201d tireless and almost always flawless juggling act. In 42 tensely packed minutes, \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d squeezes in an important, deepening scene for nearly all of its main and supporting characters and their ongoing plotlines \u2014 even Alicia\u2019s boring teenagers. All the while, the show displays its hallmark ability to operate in a world driven and shaped by technology; defecting associates are a crisis only a good IT staff can thwart. All of which is to say it takes a nuclear meltdown like this for \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d to set aside its usual case-trial-resolution backdrop. Here you begin to wonder why the creators still lack the confidence (or network permission?) to do so more often. At last we see Alicia with claws out. \u201cHitting the Fan,\u201d as advertised, reshuffles the deck in ways that might see \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d through to a satisfying series conclusion in the not-too-distant future.

It\u2019s about sports, generally a pretty safe late-night topic. But he\u2019s worried it won\u2019t ever be funny. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The premise? \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t like sports is it reminds me of the futility of doing anything.\u201d  Specifically: \u201cBecause people are like \u2018Why put the ball in the hoop?\u2019 But it\u2019s like, \u2018Why brush your teeth?\u2019 It\u2019s just, like, the problem of life.\u201d Which is maybe a lot to think about at midnight, when his new show will air, after \u201cConan,\u201d on TBS. Sleep well, viewers. Also, everything is pointless. Stay tuned for a celebrity interview. But Holmes might give it a try. He already has a pretty good idea that people like to listen to him talk about life\u2019s bigger questions. Now he just has to hope they want to watch him, too.\n Holmes, a comedian whose one-hour special on Comedy Central premiered this spring and whose most broadly recognizable credit at this point is \u201cvoice of the Etrade baby,\u201d hosts a podcast called \u201c You Made it Weird .\u201d In episodes that can cross the three-hour threshold on occasion, he leads his guests, usually fellow comedians, on intimate discussions that cover comedy, relationships and religion. And also the benefits of raw chocolate, how close he is to his mother and the value of transcendental meditation. When it came time to pitch the show to TBS, he says, he could point to the 100-plus interviews he\u2019d already done \u2014 plus sketch comedy videos for College Humor, his stand-up experience and time spent writing on television shows. He had essentially DIY-ed his late-night bona fides. \u201cFor better or worse, these days, because it is possible to do so many things on your own, nobody really believes you can do it until you\u2019re already doing it,\u201d Holmes says. Holmes is the latest comedian to propel himself on a podcast-to-television-show pipeline. The group of comedians using experience with podcasts \u2013 easily downloadable and generally free audio shows, featuring interviews, sketch comedy, monologues and other experimentation \u2013 includes Nikki Glaser and Sara Schaefer, who turned the rapport they demonstrated on their podcast \u201c You Had to Be There \n\u201d into \u201c Nikki and Sara Live \u201d on MTV, which will have its season finale Tueday. Chris Hardwick, who recently launched \u201c @midnight \u201d on Comedy Central, also brought his \u201c Nerdist \u201d podcast to television on BBC America this past spring. In pursuing more comedy programming, IFC has developed two shows from podcasts. Marc Maron, of the popular podcast \u201c WTF ,\u201d has a scripted show on the network based on his life as a podcaster called \u201cMaron,\u201d which will be back for a second season next spring. Scott Aukerman brought an absurdist faux talk-show version of his \u201c Comedy Bang Bang \u201d podcast, with band-leading assistance from Reggie Watts, to television viewers. The network just announced that it is bringing the show back for a third season and announced a development deal with the podcast network Earwolf, which Aukerman co-runs.   Television executives like comedy podcasts for the same reason comedy fans do:They are an easy way to hear funny people doing funny things. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Jennifer Caserta, IFC\u2019s president and general manager, says that about three years ago, her network began to focus on original comedy development. The landscape was changing, she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that same old \u2018go to comedy clubs and sit and watch talent\u2019 every evening. There were so many points of entry in order to develop and find talent to bring to the television screen, one of which was podcasts.\u201d She used to sign expense reports on a daily basis for nights out at comedy shows and clubs for her development team, Caserta says. Now, they are more likely to depend on playlists filled with podcasts. It\u2019s cheaper, she jokes. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a better use of time.\u201d Development executives listen to podcasts while washing dishes and on their commute. \u201cYou can be far more efficient in your discovery of who\u2019s great at the craft,\u201d she says. \n Honing skills \n Of all the ways the electronic devices we carry around with us in our pockets and purses make us feel less bored or alone in the world, the fact that we can always be listening to someone or something has been a particularly fruitful development for comedians. An audience is just one touch-screen swipe of the download button away. This means there is an expanding universe of ways to refine a comedy persona. For Nikki Glaser and Sara Schaefer, who got to know each other while launching their podcast, the format allowed them to develop the special chemistry that they showcase now on their TV show. \u201cWe could interview people, learn our comedic vibe and how to play off each other,\u201d Schaefer says of the podcast training ground. \u201cJust as we were figuring out our own individual voices, we were learning this joint voice, our third voice,\u201d which, she says, helps them stand out. Scott Aukerman\u2019s pre-podcast credits include writing and performing on \u201c Mr. Show \u201d and co-creating \u201c Between Two Ferns With Zach Galifinakis .\u201d He says launching \u201cComedy Bang Bang\u201d as a podcast allowed him to develop the straight-man voice that he uses to great effect in his show now, and he sees the benefits of the medium for comedians more broadly. \u201cIt really lets people hone what they\u2019re doing and find their voice and put it out in a regular fashion,\u201d Aukerman says of podcasting. Aukerman is chatting backstage at the 9:30 Club in the middle of October, where he will perform two live versions of his podcast to capacity crowds, demonstrating another benefit of podcasting for comedians: Once you find the voice, you find out that people are listening. \u201cThis is such a great time for comedy fans,\u201d says Paul F. Tompkins, who is in town with Aukerman for the tour. \u201cI grew up loving comedy, and if I was 12 years old and there was all this comedy content available for free \u2014 like so much \u2014 and all these people interacting with each other, I\u2019d lose my mind.\u201d \n Keeping the vibe \n How do you put all that is weird and intimate and wonderful about a podcast on TV? You don\u2019t just turn a camera on. You have to pick what to keep.   \u201cOur show is vastly different from our podcast, but the thing that we maintained is our chemistry and our vibe,\u201d Schaefer says of the show she and Glaser developed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Aukerman started his first television season trying to retain many familiar elements from the podcast. Ultimately, they weren\u2019t his favorite parts of the show, so he has adapted and hopes fans will follow along for both distinct experiences. (He also notes that the podcast, which, according to him, has approximately 175,000 \u201clistens\u201d a week, has a larger audience than the televivion show.) Maron\u2019s podcast has 2.5\u2009million to 3\u2009million downloads each month, according to IFC. For the television show \u2014 which has an audience of 2\u2009million, when combining live viewership plus a week of playback on DVR \u2014 he says the natural thing for him to try to do would have been an intimate talk format. So he went the other way and pitched a fictional show, based on his life as a podcaster, talking to people in his garage. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly unique world. If I had pitched that world 10 years ago, it would have been a fantasy world.\u201d Louis C.K. or Sarah Silverman just talking in his garage. It would have seemed ridiculous. \u201cI don\u2019t know that at the time that any of us could have really known the cultural visibility that [podcasts] would have especially within the industry,\u201d Maron says. The podcast as a platform to a higher profile in entertainment isn\u2019t a fantasy world anymore. It is, however, a fantasy fulfilled. In second grade, or maybe it was third, Holmes was already the star of his own show. \u201cThe Pete Show,\u201d he called it. It was mostly him talking to himself in the mirror. He debated recycling that name for the late-night show just \u201cto make it like a one-for-one dream-come-true sort of thing,\u201d he says, but he was worried it might alienate viewers who have no idea who this Pete guy is. When his show debuts Monday, viewers will quickly learn \u2014 perhaps more than they want to \u2014 all about Pete. He promises to maintain the \u201covershariness\u201d that is a trademark of his podcast while incorporating sketch comedy segments, interviews with friends and monologues that aren\u2019t strictly drawn from the headlines. In talking about his approach to the show, Holmes quotes the late comedian Bill Hicks, who said \u201cas a comedian and as a performer if you\u2019re being yourself no one can be yourself as well as you, so you\u2019ll have supply and demand covered.\u201d Judging from his prolific podcast output, he has the supply part down. And he\u2019s optimistic about the demand. \n A listening guide to new TV hosts and their comedy podcasts \n Comedy podcasts are propelling their hosts to new television opportunities. But the original medium isn\u2019t being neglected. A listening guide to get you downloading. \n\n \u201c You Made It Weird With Pete Holmes \u201d \n\n Holmes\u2019s show on the Nerdist podcast network features lengthy, intimate discussions with fellow comedians and others. He says his favorite episode is the March 2012 conversation with his friend Emily Gordon , a writer and producer (and the wife of the comedian Kumail Nanjiani). \n\n \n \u201cComedy Bang Bang\u201d \n \n\n The Internet funhouse that Scott Aukerman built on this podcast features comic chatter and oddball characters. If Amy Poehler rapping in place of Sarah Palin on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d back in 2008 was \u2014 as it should have been \u2014 a highlight of your entertainment consumption, check out her recent appearance on this podcast. There is some freestyle rapping. \n\n \n \u201cWTF With Marc Maron\u201d \n \n\n Maron is a comedic conversational podcast pioneer. One recent highlight includes Natasha Lyonne. But if you\u2019re starting from scratch, listen to the Louie C.K. episode. \n\n \n \u201cYou Had to Be There\u201d \n \n\n Sara Schaefer says the feedback she and her co-host Nikki Glaser often get is: \u201cYou two remind me of me and my best friend.\u201d The show is a chance to listen in on these friends \u2014 and their comedian guests. \n\n And a guest recommendation from comedian Paul F. Tompkins: \n\n Tompkins says it\u2019s been great to see how many people are pushing past just \u201cthe conversational thing\u201d and doing sketch and radio drama. One example: \u201c Getting On With James Urbaniak .\u201d \u201cI only listen to it at night \u2014 it\u2019s very moody,\u201d Tompkins says.", "topics": ["entertainment", "tv"], "author": "Rachel Dry", "wordCount": 1730}, {"date": "2013-10-25 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019 recap: We could really use some gladiating", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636699/s/32e450e0/sc/4/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Cscandal0Erecap0Ewe0Ecould0Ereally0Euse0Esome0Egladiating0C20A130C10A0C250C4be39a320E3d1e0E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itv/story01.htm", "text": "Warning: This recap contains spoilers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t This week\u2019s episode took a page from the show that taught me how to binge-watch like a champion: \u2018Law and Order: SVU.\u2019 The ripped-from-the-headlines plots are a trademark of the NBC show, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what Olivia Pope and Associates (or we) need right now. I didn\u2019t care for the latest client to seek the gladiators\u2019 help \u2014 Sen. Richard Meyers, a \u201cperving, sexting, pervy-perv\u201d accused of murdering a young woman to whom he sent pictures of his, er, Richard. But props to Abby for using the word \u201cperving.\u201d Also, I think we can all agree that Redwood Johnson > Carlos Danger. But we need not concern ourselves with Richard. This episode also brought: Lisa Kudrow, who led to Mellie\u2019s southern-fried encounter with a hot mike, a rekindled romance between Abby and David and a budding bromance (!!!) between Huck and Jake. We also learned more about Fitz\u2019s connection to Operation Remington and ... Rowan (who still owns everyone, btw). I\u2019d rather Cyrus be president, but I felt a weird sympathy for Fitz when he orchestrated a military funeral for Peter Foster. Where are you taking us, Shonda Rhimes? The honor of most unbelievable storyline goes to Olivia throwing Jake out of her apartment. Who would throw Scott Foley out of their apartment? Spoiler alert: No one. Most legit? Mellie\u2019s hot mike moment . Cyrus scolding her \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s the second rule of politics? The same rule applies to gun ownership: the microphone is always loaded.\u201d \u2014 was icing on the cake. I wasn\u2019t the only one who saw Fitz stand up for Mellie, right? Also, let us not forget Cyrus and James, the shamelessly unrealistic couple whose pillow talk involved James, the serious journalist, begging his hubby, the White House Chief of Staff, for a quote. Oh, sure, honey. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m more in love with Abby and David (Dabby) as a couple or with Abby\u2019s hair, but I do know that I like where this is going. Also, thanks Dabby for this amazing exchange, which made the whole perv plotline worth it. David: \u201cIs that a pic of your...\u201d Abby: \u201cYep. It\u2019s an addiction, David. I can\u2019t help myself.\u201d Speaking of addictions, I\u2019m worried about Huck, who is continuing his impressive whiskey as a metaphor for murder act, but I can worry about him less now that he\u2019s teamed up with Jake (to protect Olivia and also, presumably, take care of Rowan. Superheroes among us.). That leaves me more time to worry about Quinn, whose bloodthirst rivals one of the baby vampires from \u201cTwilight.\u201d I will totally enable you, Baby Huck. You are crazy in the best way. Once again, \u201cScandal\u201d has mastered the art of making my heart beat really fast in the last five minutes of the episode. It figures that Jake and Olivia\u2019s makeout sesh would be interrupted by The Fitz Phone. Jake smartly offered to refill Olivia\u2019s larger-than-your-face wine glass in a very loud voice, causing a dejected Fitz to cut the call short. I almost felt sorry for Fitz as he exited his limo like a sad toddler and walked down the very long hallway, but that turned to horror/delight as he came face-to-face with Rowan. A week until the next episode (and a full look at that gorgeous black and white gown)? Our reunion, gladiators, will be long overdue. \n\n Lingering questions: Where is Lisa Kudrow\u2019s baby and really, \u201cScandal,\u201d an abandoned baby is the best we can do? How far back do Fitz and Rowan go? Will Huck ever slip and say murder instead of whiskey at one of his meetings? Also, when do I get to learn more about Harrison? Need. More.

Patrick\u2019s feast starts the inevitable walker domino effect, interrupting another idyllic morning for the rest of the prison. Rick and Carl are farming cucumbers together, while Michonne is off on another supply run. Things are always so comfortable and calm when gunshots ring out. When the fight in cell block D is over, Rick finds one last walker locked in a cell with no bites or injuries. What is obvious to viewers becomes obvious to the group \u2014 there is an illness turning humans into walkers. Hershel imparts his grandfatherly wisdom during an emergency council meeting, advising that anyone exposed should be kept away from others. Whatever the flu-like illness is, no one is sure who might get it or how fast. Even Karen, who has a cough, is sent to quarantine. As the group deals with the silent threat of a deadly virus inside the camp, walkers outside finally make headway on taking down the prison\u2019s flimsy outer fence. How it\u2019s held up as long as it has already is unclear. Sasha, Daryl, Glenn and Maggie stab the intruders as the fence bends, and Rick joins them. After having taken a hiatus from taking out walkers, it seems difficult for Rick to do so again. He is now physically standing between his garden and a horde of zombies, caught in limbo. But in the end, he stabs more vehemently and sacrifices his pigs outside of the prison to draw the walkers away. He grimaces at each squealing pig he slices open, but it\u2019s become clear to him that violence is the only way to survive. He even gives Carl his gun back and holsters his own. In other character development news, Carol\u2019s work to educate the children in \u201cwalker safety\u201d is put to the test when she scolds a young girl who cannot bring herself to stab her own father-turned-walker after the attack in cell D. In the end, Carol has to stab him in front of them. Though the father-stabbing scene is cheesy and a bit over the top, Carol has lived through marital abuse and lost her daughter to walkers. She, like Rick, realizes survival comes with a cost. Her intentions are good. Finally, with the scary threat of a virus in the midst of the prison, coughing Karen and a fellow prison member are found burnt alive in quarantine. Tyreese, on his way to give flowers to Karen, discovers them. Whatever the illness turning humans into walkers is, it has someone on high alert \u2014 high enough to try and snuff it out with gasoline and a match. Hopefully we find out who the culprit is next week.\n \n\n Romance report: Well. Tyreese and Karen didn\u2019t last long. There was a sweet moment at the beginning of the episode between the two, in which Tyreese croons \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d Alas, Karen is no more. Not much to report on Maggie and Glenn. They also share a moment when Glenn snaps a Polaroid photo of her in the morning. \n\n Unanswered questions: Rats. At the beginning of the episode, someone feeds a rat to a walker through the prison\u2019s outer fence. Who is doing that, and why are they trying to bait more walkers to the prison?", "topics": ["entertainment", "tv"], "author": "Margaret Ely", "wordCount": 593}, {"date": "2013-10-20 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "HBO\u2019s \u2018Life According to Sam\u2019: When a mom\u2019s research might be the key to her son\u2019s survival", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636699/s/32b0fdfb/sc/8/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Chbos0Elife0Eaccording0Eto0Esam0Ewhen0Ea0Emoms0Eresearch0Emight0Ebe0Ethe0Ekey0Eto0Eher0Esons0Esurvival0C20A130C10A0C20A0C2a9c0A2d60E37620E11e30E8a0Ae0E4e2cf80A831fc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itv/story01.htm", "text": "When we first meet him, Sam Berns is a fairly happy eighth-grader living outside Boston, interested in Legos and science; he dreams of joining the marching band when he starts high school. But he is 13 going on 90, coping with a rare genetic disease (there are believed to be fewer than 300 reported cases worldwide) called progeria, which bizarrely and cruelly ages and weakens its young victims. Sam has reached the usual life expectancy for those with the disease; there is no cure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t As such, the absorbing and deeply inspiring \u201cLife According to Sam\u201d (airing Monday night on HBO) has the makings of one of those documentaries that can \u2014 like so many films and long-form feature articles in its genre \u2014 become only a weepy, front-row seat to a family\u2019s heartbreak. But \u201cLife According to Sam,\u201d directed and produced by the Oscar-winning, Washington-based filmmakers Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine, is not here to depress us. The film is as much \u2014 or maybe more \u2014 about Sam\u2019s resiliently proactive mother, Leslie Gordon, as it is about Sam. When faced with her son\u2019s prognosis, Gordon,\u2009a medical doctor, decided with her husband, Scott Berns (a pediatric ER doctor), to start a research foundation and attempt a clinical drug trial on 28 children who have progeria \u2014 including Sam. Over several years, the children are given a cancer drug, Lonafarnib, which might slow progeria\u2019s effects enough to significantly prolong the children\u2019s lives. There is so much at stake in \u201cLife According to Sam\u201d that some viewers might not be able to endure the worry and fear. Sam is instantly charming and, like so many children with terminal illness, articulates what he knows the adults around him \u2014 including the rock star Dave Matthews, who is among Sam\u2019s admirers \u2014 most need to hear. \u201cI didn\u2019t put myself in front of you to have you feel bad for me,\u201d he tells the camera. \u201cI put myself in front of you to let you know that you don\u2019t have to feel bad for me.\u201d As such, the film ably transitions to and from its parallel stories of uplift and defeat. The children in the drug trial come with their parents from as far away as Pakistan and India, hinging their hopes on Gordon\u2019s exhaustive trial. She and Berns, in turn, invest their hopes in their remarkable boy\u2019s optimism and joy \u2014 even as the study is rejected by two medical journals because the researchers broke form and didn\u2019t test a placebo along with the drug. \u201cLife According to Sam\u201d is remarkable in the ways it mimics the guiding principle and spirit of its main subject. Although it has a lot to tell us about the science of genomes and the rigors of FDA approval, it doesn\u2019t necessarily want you to feel sorry or outraged or moved to act. It only wants you to feel how fragile yet wonderful life can be. Do yourself a favor and come hang out with Sam for a while. \n \u2018Hunting the Nightmare Bacteria\u2019 \n There are plenty of horror stories on TV as Halloween approaches, but the most frightening program this week might be PBS\u2019s \u201cFrontline\u201d report on antibiotic-resistant viruses, \u201cHunting the Nightmare Bacteria,\u201d airing Tuesday night. Washington Post contributing editor David E. Hoffman reports on three recent cases in which doctors were all but helpless to defeat infections run amok: In Tucson, an adolescent girl picked up a MRSA virus from a playground scrape; only a lung transplant could ultimately combat it \u2014 and even then not cure it. In a train accident in India, an American missionary lost a leg and picked up one of the nastier forms of superviruses in the hospital, which he brought home with him. And much closer to home, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda goes into panic mode after 18 patients acquired the antibiotic-resistant KPC virus. Six patients died , followed by a seventh months later, according to Frontline, which demonstrates how perniciously the virus lurks. What\u2019s to be done? As \u201cFrontline\u201d notes, we\u2019ve long known that the effectiveness of antibiotics would wane if we took them too much, which, of course, we did. The usual accomplices \u2014 the pharmaceutical research industry, public indifference, failure of hospitals to open up about infection rates in their facilities, lack of government oversight \u2014 come into play, but there are no reassuring answers to be had here. Forget zombies. This may be what does us in. \n Life According to Sam \n \n \n (95 minutes) airs Monday at 9 p.m. \n \n \n on HBO, with encores. \n \n Frontline: Hunting the Nightmare Bacteria \n \n \n (one hour)

"text": "You crack open Tim Finch\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe House of Journalists,\u201d with an almost gleeful sense of anticipation. Set in London in a home for exiled writers, the story promises to be intelligent, thoughtful, politically astute. You skim the author\u2019s bio and consider his qualifications: He has worked for a London think tank, a refugee council, the BBC. You read the first 40 pages and find that you like his tone: clever, erudite and just a wee bit cheeky. From time to time, you wonder about the author\u2019s extensive use of the second person, in which you yourself are addressed as one of the key characters, a person by the name of \u201cAA,\u201d but the style grows on you, and it does have the effect of putting you smack dab in the middle of scenes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t You read on, intrigued. You find yourself truly liking Finch\u2019s characters. They are idiosyncratic, original, sympathetic, recognizable. You don\u2019t necessarily know all the specifics of their stories, such as the names of the countries each character is fleeing, but that doesn\u2019t really matter because there seems to be a universal bond that joins the residents of the House of Journalists. They are, as Finch puts it, \u201cunited in exile and nostalgia for the food of home.\u201d  As you read, you are drawn to Agnes, the hardened, 23-year-old, chain-smoking photographer with close-cropped hair who writes poetry about her country\u2019s descent into barbarism. You enjoy the company of the thoughtful, soft-spoken Mustapha, who was arrested by his country\u2019s secret police. You\u2019re quite fond of the elderly Mr. Stan with his \u201chumpty head\u201d and his knotted hands \u2014 disfigured by torturers who wanted to make sure that he would never write again. Perhaps your favorite character is the foul-mouthed, Nobel Prize-winning Ted Crumb, who visits the House of Journalists and rages against the hypocrisy of his government and the House itself. And then there are characters like Julian Snowman, the House\u2019s self-important founder, who grows increasingly paranoid as the novel proceeds. True, you don\u2019t care for this fellow, but you find him to be a credible, comic creation, and you like hearing about him, much as you like hearing the stories about the rest of the journalists \u2014 even \u201cAA,\u201d the character played by you. You sense that some intrigue is developing, some mystery involving skullduggery and secret societies. You keep reading, though not as quickly and attentively as when you started. By now, you\u2019re nearly halfway through the novel, and you find yourself getting worried, yes, maybe a bit bogged down. Oh, you still admire Finch\u2019s writing, his intelligence, the originality of his style, the seeming authenticity of his exiled characters\u2019 monologues. But you\u2019re starting to wonder if all this knowledge and mastery of detail will coalesce into a plot. You wonder if you\u2019re being shallow, sensationalistic or overly traditional for craving forward motion. Perhaps Finch is demonstrating that writing fiction after describing torture and civil war is barbaric. And yet you can\u2019t deny your own desires \u2014 as a lover of fiction, you crave stories; you want this all to lead somewhere. You note that your character, this \u201cAA,\u201d seems to disappear for large swathes of narrative. As a reader, you too find yourself checking out every now and again. You wonder if Finch intends for you to feel his reader\u2019s alienation \u2014 if he anticipates exactly how you will become distracted from his novel. Clever, you think. Probably too clever. You arrive at a chapter called \u201cDevelopments.\u201d Here, you think, is where the novel will gain traction, propel you onward. And yet that doesn\u2019t happen, not really. Julian Snowman, exhibiting \u201cincreasingly manic behaviour,\u201d becomes convinced that someone is plotting against the House of Journalists. Even you, AA, are suspected. You sense that the leadership of the House of Journalists is becoming its own form of repressive regime. Yet none of this registers with sufficient impact. Finally, in the novel\u2019s last pages, Finch does try to tie the strands of his novel together, using a rather nifty, meta-fictional trick, one that explains the precise role you, AA, have been playing all along in creating the narrative. You generally love this sort of post-modern gamesmanship, but this time you feel it\u2019s too late for that. You\u2019re still not satisfied. Yes, you have to say it, you were expecting more from Finch\u2019s characters. You sense that this is simply not the great novel you were expecting, but you still feel confident that Finch is capable of writing one. And when he does, you will be eager to read it. \n Langer is the author of a memoir and five novels.

Each week, she had a small budget to take them to bookstores and comic shops. The kids had varied tastes: Some liked high fantasy, others superhero stories, many enjoyed realistic portrayals of teenage life. But one quality they all demanded of their books was size. Volume . She might suggest titles they could finish in an afternoon, but they always refused. Finally, Angie asked why the big books were in high demand. The kids waved the tomes as if the answer were self-evident: \u201cTo show off,\u201d they said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Dan Simmons is a big-book writer. Two of his recent novels \u2014 \u201c The Terror \u201d and \u201c Drood \u201d \u2014 clock in at almost 800 pages apiece. Both were bestsellers, and both displayed Simmons\u2019s prodigious research. \u201cThe Terror\u201d told the story of Capt. John Franklin\u2019s doomed voyage to the Arctic, and \u201cDrood\u201d imagined the last years in the life of Charles Dickens.  \u201c The Abominable \u201d continues in this vein with a fictionalized account of the race to climb Mount Everest in 1925. This one clocks in at a svelte 663 pages, but it\u2019s still a behemoth. Angie\u2019s question to her kids \u2014 \u201cWhy such big books?\u201d \u2014 occurred to me as I read \u201cThe Abominable.\u201d What are big books meant to do? Early in \u201cThe Abominable,\u201d a three-man climbing team \u2014 Richard David Deacon, Jean-Claude Clairoux\n and Jacob William Perry \u2014 have just scaled the Matterhorn. But even here the men can\u2019t escape bad news. A newspaper brought with them carries word that famed mountaineer George Mallory has died trying to climb Everest.\n The group\u2019s leader, Richard, had gone on a previous Everest attempt with Mallory, and he seems shaken by the news of his old colleague\u2019s death. But as the team descends the Matterhorn, he makes a surprising offer to Jean-Claude and Jacob: \u201cWould you care to accompany me on a fully funded expedition to climb Mount Everest in the next spring and early summer of nineteen twenty-five?\u201d Without hesi\u00adta\u00adtion, Jacob and Jean-Claude say yes.\n If it were really that simple, this wouldn\u2019t be much of a novel, though. Jacob, Jean-Claude and Richard will have their quest complicated by Lady Bromley, their financier, who will fund them only if they\u2019ll search for her son, who was lost on the mountain around the same date as Mallory. In Munich, they\u2019ll have a run-in with some unimaginatively drawn Nazis. Their three-man team will expand to include an accomplished woman climber, a Tibetan doctor and 30 sherpas. And of course, there is the possibility, implied by the title, that the mythical yeti roams the great mountain. Sounds like good fun. There\u2019s all this story to be told and much more besides. And yet the middle of this book suffers. Why? Research. Simmons has clearly done a phenomenal amount of reading. Some of the climbs are so vivid I\u2019d swear Simmons has done some mountaineering. But there isn\u2019t a hiking maneuver or a piece of hiking gear that Simmons is willing to gloss over. Whether its pages and pages about Primus stoves or Mark VI oxygen packs, you can be sure you\u2019ll read way too much about way too much. The average reader can skim all this without losing anything. And yet with all my carping about the research, I did find myself genuinely affected by the time I finished \u201cThe Abominable.\u201d After all, I\u2019d been traveling through countries and up mountains with this crew. I\u2019d seen some survive and others die in ways that were admirable or foolish or horrifying. There are so many small, vivid moments in these pages, such as when an oxygen tank clanks all the way down a 1,000-foot drop in a glacier. By the end, I felt Simmons had led me on an epic journey, and I was grateful for it. Maybe when Angie\u2019s kids said they liked big books because they could \u201cshow off,\u201d they were explaining only part of the appeal. After all, most of those kids regularly returned for more. Spend days, or weeks, inside a book and it becomes a companion.

But the war must still be largely a mystery to us, a great blow to the American Dream of comradeship and opportunity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t In his terrific new novel about the awful conflict, Dennis McFarland focuses on \u201cnostalgia,\u201d or what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder. By any name, it\u2019s the entirely human instinct to retreat \u2014 in one\u2019s own mind, at least \u2014 from horror.  \n\n Young Summerfield Hayes \n\n lives in an earthly paradise. \n Although he\u2019s remarkably intelligent for his 19 \n\n years \u2014 well educated and well brought up \u2014 he\u2019s too innocent to appreciate the real nature of his circumstances. He lives in Brooklyn \n\n in 1864 \n\n with his devoted older sister, Sarah \n\n . \n They have been recently orphaned, but their parents left them very comfortable. \n The days and nights pass by in a relaxed routine of well-cooked meals, easy pleasantries and long afternoons lounging in window seats reading. Sarah works as a schoolmistress, \n and Summerfield holds a job as a clerk for a local shipwright, although his real passion is pitching for a baseball team \n . (It is still baseball\u2019s golden age, played mostly for love, not money.) \n\n Everything is fine until the young man realizes that his love for his sister is growing out of bounds. Appalled at his thoughts, he takes what seems to him to be an honorable way out: He enlists in the Union Army. Almost before he knows it, he\u2019s in training, then in battle, then irrevocably lost in the Virginia wilderness, deserted by his comrades, bleeding from wounds, temporarily deaf. Gradually, he (and the reader) begin to understand that what he sees, hears and feels isn\u2019t necessarily real. What he remembers, he\u2019d rather not: burying his tent mate in a shallow grave, seeing his best friend torn apart by a necklace of exploding cartridges, hearing his bayonet going into some poor man\u2019s guts. After a hundred or so pages of ghastly war narrative, the boy ends up in a Union hospital. How were traumatized soldiers treated in the middle of the 19th century? \u201cReal\u201d men took a dim view of \u201ccoddling\u201d warriors, and McFarland creates a beautifully creepy villain: a doctor who is convinced that Summerfield is malingering and plots awful traps to catch him. During one of the attempts, a dying soldier next to Summerfield screams out scornfully, \u201cCourt-martial me, why don\u2019t you? I\u2019m dead already, you stinking parlor soldier.\u201d But the doctor goes on with his awful schemes, which reminds us that in times of stress, the best of us get better, and the worst of us get much worse. Another fascinating layer of this novel has to do with Walt Whitman. He spent day after day in Union hospitals, reading to wounded soldiers, bringing them fruit and candy, providing them with fresh clothes and just chatting, giving them his comfort and encouragement. In this creative re-imagining, he becomes an important friend to Summerfield.\n The last third of \u201cNostalgia\u201d is about coming home. McFarland\u2019s use of the Civil War to explore these themes makes sober sense. Many men, I would guess, want to fight for the right as they see it. But another part of them wants to lounge in the library window seat and wait for a well-cooked dinner. War or peace? It may not even be a moral question but a practical one. A civil war within ourselves. McFarland doesn\u2019t give us an answer, but he poses the question masterfully. \n See reviews books regularly for The Washington Post. \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t NOSTALGIA By Dennis McFarland Pantheon. 322 pp. $25.95", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "Carolyn See", "wordCount": 603}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "\u2018Drink: Relationship Between Women and Alcohol\u2019 by Ann Dowsett Johnston", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636572/s/3333db09/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Copinions0Cdrink0Erelationship0Ebetween0Ewomen0Eand0Ealcohol0Eby0Eann0Edowsett0Ejohnston0C20A130C110C0A10Ccde2917e0E34f30E11e30E80Ac60E7e6dd8d22d8f0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibooks/story01.htm", "text": "Two-thirds of the way into this wallop of a book, a little girl delivers a crystal-clear insight into the life of an alcoholic. She is with a group of children enrolled in a program to help kids break the cycle of their parents\u2019 alcoholism. The counselor has just asked each child in the room to briefly carry a 41-pound backpack full of rocks. \u201cMany of your moms and dads are carrying that backpack,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere do you think they carry it?\u201d The 7-year-old girl\u2019s response: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in that space between your heart and spirit.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t That mysterious terrain of the soul drives the narrative trajectory in Ann Dowsett Johnston\u2019s \u201cDrink.\u201d Her approach is not strictly reporting, nor is it a full-blown memoir. Rather, she creates a hybrid of the two, weaving back and forth between research and raw confessions as she untangles the messy realities behind women\u2019s rising rate of alcohol abuse. A past editor of McClean\u2019s magazine in Canada and former vice principal at McGill University, Johnston makes awful sense of it all. \u201cWe live in an alcogenic culture,\u201d she writes, \u201cwhere risky drinking has been normalized.\u201d Increasingly, it is women who are suffering the consequences.  As a recovering alcoholic, Johnston is adept at drawing from her own addiction to build a bridge, one self-hewn brick at a time, between those who know too well the allure of the drink and those who don\u2019t understand the lust. Here\u2019s her description of those first few sips: \u201cMy shoulders seemed to unhitch from my earlobes. With the second, I could exhale. I loved the way the wine worked on my innards. That first glass would melt some glacial layer of tension, a barrier between me and the world. Somehow with the second glass, the tectonic plates of my psyche would shift, and I\u2019d be more at ease. Jake [her former partner] used to say it this way: \u2018When you drink, that piano on your back seems to disappear.\u2019 \u201d \n Johnston brings the weight of her journalism and academic experience to build a convincing case that women are increasingly succumbing to the dark side of alcohol. The book is meant to alarm us, one searing fact at a time. Let\u2019s start with why women drink. Men tend to imbibe to socialize and heighten positive feelings, she writes, but women drink to drive away negative feelings. They\u2019re at an immediate disadvantage. Women, on average, have more body fat, which fails to dilute alcohol. They also have a lower level of an enzyme that helps the body break it down. Hormone fluctuations make them more vulnerable, too, particularly when estrogen levels rise. \u201cThe list goes on,\u201d Johnston writes. \u201cWomen\u2019s chemistry means they become dependent on alcohol much faster than men. Other consequences \u2014 including cognitive deficits and liver disease \u2014 all occur in women, with significantly shorter exposure to alcohol. Women who consume four or more alcoholic beverages a day quadruple their risk of dying from heart disease. Heavy drinkers of both genders run the risk of a fatal hemorrhagic stroke, but the odds are five times higher for women.\u201d \n   Women are starting to drink at younger ages, too. No. 1 influence: their parents\u2019 drinking habits. No. 2: sexual abuse or trauma in childhood. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Johnston offers a withering review of our culture that romanticizes alcohol. All those bridal registries full of glittering champagne flutes, happy-hour promotions and ads trumpeting the fun, happy people who partake. \u201cIs alcohol the new tobacco?\u201d Johnston asks, and turns to advertising critic Jean Kilbourne for the answer: \u201cPeople perceive the tobacco companies as more clearly evil than the alcohol companies. Of course they\u2019re different: any use of tobacco is harmful, and that\u2019s not true for alcohol. There\u2019s such a thing as low-risk use of alcohol \u2014 although that\u2019s not the kind of use that is of any interest to the alcohol industry. If everybody drank in a low-risk way we\u2019d all be better off \u2014 except, of course, the alcohol companies. They\u2019d go under. They depend on high-risk drinkers and alcoholics, and that\u2019s what people need to understand.\u201d\n Johnston is just as hard on herself. There are times when her book feels like one long, agonized apology to her grown son, Nicholas. She puts him at the center of an alcoholic mother\u2019s universe, a sensitive boy who grows into a man finally willing to express the pain of that role. After a root canal gone bad, she had to abstain from drinking for three weeks. A glimpse of her sobriety inspired then-20-year-old Nicholas to make a Mother\u2019s Day card titled \u201cHappy Mother.\u201d In it, he depicted her sitting at a typewriter. \u201cThe whites of her eyes are white,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe is drinking Perrier, not wine.\u201d It was a turning point for Johnston. \u201cThat card . . . ended my romance with the glass. For three years I carried it everywhere, tucking it into my diary or my daybook: the truth writ large from a man I loved, one I had let down and who was brave enough to tell me how he felt.\u201d \n Johnston\u2019s writing is at its best when she offers string-of-consciousness memories from her life, her recovery. The reader is quickly trained to look forward to these passages, set in a different font to emphasize the hopscotch nature of memory. Sometimes, however, the leaps in time leave us wondering what she left out, to the point of distraction. For example, she refers to a wave of depression during college that led to a \u201cfeeble\u201d suicide attempt, but then she pulls her punch: \u201cIt was a particularly bad time at home: there are things that happened that summer I am not willing to revisit or discuss. Let\u2019s just say this: it was dire, extreme.\u201d She is asking the reader to take her word for it, but we already know that she was sometimes an alcoholic skilled in self-deception. Odd turns in a book otherwise full of riveting candor. A quibble. There are moments in \u201cDrink\u201d when the parade of alcoholic women seems endless. So many sad stories. So many alcohol-fueled ways to ruin a large swath of one\u2019s life. It feels relentless and frightening. Overwhelming. For a lot of women brave enough to read it, it may feel a little too familiar, too. Therein lies the hope. \n \n\n Connie Schultz \n, who lives in Cleveland, is a nationally syndicated columnist and essayist for Parade magazine. \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n DRINK \n\n \n\n The Intimate Relationship Between Women and Alcohol \n\n By Ann Dowsett Johnston Harper Wave. 305 pp. $27.99", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "Connie Schultz", "wordCount": 1079}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "\u2018The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772-1832\u2019 by Alan Taylor", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636572/s/3333db08/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Copinions0Cthe0Einternal0Eenemy0Eslavery0Eand0Ewar0Ein0Evirginia0E17720E18320Eby0Ealan0Etaylor0C20A130C110C0A10Cb8bcc0Ace0E27b20E11e30Ead0Ad0Eb7c8d2a594b90Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibooks/story01.htm", "text": "You may not remember all the words to \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d but did you know that Francis Scott Key wrote several verses? Or that the third verse takes a swipe at the British for emancipating American slaves during the War of 1812? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n No refuge could save the hireling and slave \n\n \n\n From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave. \n\n \n\n And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,\n \n\n \n\n O\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave. \n\n Key wrote the poem to celebrate the failure of the British navy to capture Baltimore in 1814, giving a much-needed boost to American morale after Britain\u2019s recent humiliating destruction of Washington. But what Alan Taylor wants us to notice here, and throughout his remarkable new book, is the way white Americans so readily equated their own freedom with the enslavement of blacks. The miserable hirelings and slaves employed by the British would go to their well-deserved graves, reads our national anthem, so that America would remain \u201cthe land of the free.\u201d By the time Key wrote those words, the British had already terrified the whites in the Chesapeake Bay area by invading their farms and plantations, sacking their towns and villages, and freeing their slaves. Thousands of slaves. Some enlisted in the British navy; others were \u201ccarried off\u201d to freedom in Bermuda, Nova Scotia and Trinidad. It\u2019s an extraordinary story, and \u201cThe Internal Enemy\u201d tells it in vivid prose and compelling, deeply researched detail. But Taylor never gets lost in details. He has important things to say \u2014 about slavery, about war and about America. The slaves of Virginia were the internal enemy of Taylor\u2019s title, and he opens their story with the War of Independence. In November 1775, months before Jefferson drafted his famed declaration, British officers in Virginia had begun promising freedom to slaves who escaped from their rebellious owners to enlist with His Majesty\u2019s forces. Because black Virginians knew the surrounding countryside much better than the invaders, escaping slaves became a crucial resource for the British war effort. Soon the British were emancipating entire slave families who took advantage of the American Revolution to claim their freedom in Canada or the Caribbean. Taylor tells this familiar story well and uses it to introduce readers to his two major themes. The first is the great paradox of slavery and freedom. Taylor is not interested in denouncing the founders as hypocrites. Rather, \u201cThe Internal Enemy,\u201d which has been shortlisted for the 2013 National Book Award, is best read as a sequel to Edmund Morgan\u2019s classic 1975 study, \u201cAmerican Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia.\u201d Morgan argued that Virginians relieved the dangerous class conflict between rich and poor by replacing white servants with black slaves. Freedom and opportunity for whites came to depend on the enslavement of blacks, leaving us with the perplexing spectacle of wealthy Virginia planters mounting a revolution in the name of universal liberty.   Taylor picks up where Morgan left off. (And like Morgan, Taylor wears his sophistication lightly.) He shows how some of the most libertarian consequences of the revolution actually deepened Virginia\u2019s attachment to slavery. For example, Virginia leaders abolished the aristocratic practice of bequeathing estates to the eldest son and entailing plantations so that they could never be sold out of the family line. The result, Taylor shows, was not only the accelerated decline of the old First Families of Virginia and the breakup of their estates, but also the dispersal of slave ownership much more broadly among ordinary whites. Freedom and economic opportunity in Virginia came to depend more than ever on the continued enslavement of blacks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The revolution taught white Virginians something else. Their slaves could not be trusted, precisely because they took seriously Jefferson\u2019s appeal to human equality and universal freedom. This is Taylor\u2019s second theme. The slaves, resenting their bondage more than ever, became the internal enemy of their masters\u2019 nightmares. Jolted by the escape of thousands of their slaves to the hated British, many whites began to wonder if they weren\u2019t sitting atop a powder keg that could explode at any moment into slave rebellion. Prominent planters dreamed up schemes of gradual emancipation to be followed by the colonization of blacks somewhere beyond the borders of the United States. They sincerely wanted all men to be free, but they just as sincerely wanted all Americans to be white. The contradictions of early Virginia society became glaringly obvious during the War of 1812. Once again the British invaded the Tidewater areas of Virginia. Once again they enticed slaves with offers of freedom. And once again thousands of slaves took advantage. At its heart \u201cThe Internal Enemy\u201d is the story of slavery in Virginia during the War of 1812 \u2014 not only of slaves but of slaveholders. One chapter is devoted to a case study of Corotoman, a large Virginia planation that passed by marriage from one of the wealthiest families in colonial Virginia \u2014 the Carters \u2014 into the hands of St. George Tucker, one of the most respected planter-lawyers of the post-revolutionary generation. The Tucker family saga was played out against a backdrop of general economic decline for Virginia planters, and the endless struggle between white owners and managers on the one hand and the restless internal enemy on the other. Taylor traces the shattering effect of the British invasion during the War of 1812 on plantations like Corotoman. But the same invasion that disrupted so many Tidewater plantations offered the chance of freedom to thousands of Virginia slaves. Taylor shows that wartime runaways often escaped in family groups, unlike the individual young men who most often absconded in peacetime. He takes us to Nova Scotia and Trinidad to show us the kind of lives the former Virginia slaves were able to build for themselves. They were poor, they were often discriminated against, but they were free, they knew it, and they said so in poignant but unflinching letters to their former owners. By unearthing and quoting from these extraordinary documents, Taylor demolishes the myth that the British cynically reenslaved the very people they had enticed with offers of freedom. Taylor writes locally but thinks globally. He does not doubt, for example, that the British were sincerely committed to freeing Virginia slaves, but he also knows that British imperialists were learning from their experience how to use emancipation as a moral justification for their own projects of colonial expansion. Indeed, it\u2019s hard not to be dazzled by the ease with which Taylor moves from the lives of individual slaves, to the history of a large planter family, to the fault lines of Virginia politics, to the national debate over slavery in the western territories, out into the Atlantic world to the history of the British Empire. Taylor is not the first historian to suggest that the War of 1812 was a turning point in U.S. history, but the direction he sees America turning is not the familiar one. The war did not awaken a unifying American nationalism or usher in an \u201cera of good feelings.\u201d On the contrary, Taylor argues, it left an embittered legacy of sectional animosity. New Englanders had never much liked the war and were in no hurry to help Virginians keep their black workers enslaved. Southerners came away from the experience deeply suspicious of their Northern countrymen. This sectional conflict would explode into national politics with the Missouri crisis a few years later. But the tension would not be resolved until another war, an immense and brutal Civil War, finally broke the powerful and disfiguring link between slavery and freedom in the United States. \n \n\n James Oakes \n is the author of \u201cFreedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865.\u201d \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n THE INTERNAL ENEMY \n\n \n\n Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772-1832 \n\n By Alan Taylor Norton. 605 pp. $35", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "James oakes", "wordCount": 1298}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Johnny Carson by Henry Bushkiin", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636572/s/3333db07/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Copinions0Cjohnny0Ecarson0Eby0Ehenry0Ebushkiin0C20A130C110C0A10Cd9eeac0A60E2f980E11e30Ebbed0Ea8a60Ac60A11530Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibooks/story01.htm", "text": "When legendary \u201cTonight Show\u201d host Johnny Carson signed off as the king of late-night TV in 1992 after 30 years, he had three ex-wives, two estranged sons and millions of adoring fans. What Carson, who died of respiratory failure in 2005, did not have was lawyer Henry Bushkin, whom he fired in 1988 for alleged financial chicanery and insufficient loyalty after 18 years of beck-and-call service. It is now payback time for Bushkin, whose book \u201cJohnny Carson\u201d offers a fallen insider\u2019s look at the high-maintenance superstar who dominated the small screen with brilliant monologues, famous guests and headline-driven, headline-making jokes that remain the gold standard of the genre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Bushkin is hoping that two decades after Carson\u2019s \u201cTonight\u201d exit, and with several books about his former boss already in print, Johnny junkies remain insatiable. He dishes freely about life in the cutthroat world of network television, including his tense, highly successful contract negotiations with NBC brass and his secret talks with ABC execs eager for Carson to jump ship. He rehashes the comedian\u2019s well-known feuds with Joan Rivers and Wayne Newton, describes Carson\u2019s insistence that a drunk Dean Martin not perform at Ronald Reagan\u2019s first inaugural gala and provides copious details about the high life the duo shared \u2014 usually without their wives \u2014 in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Europe.  \u201cBombastic Bushkin,\u201d as Carson dubbed him on the show, is a facile writer, by turns funny, dark, gossipy, angry, morose and self-serving about their lucrative bromance gone wrong. He was just 27 when hired for what became the \u201cmost rewarding and the most disappointing\u201d relationship of his life. The Bronx-born lawyer morphed into a minor Hollywood player as Carson\u2019s \u201cSwiss Army knife of a companion, attorney, manager, agent, henchman, crony, tennis pal and corkscrew, all in one.\u201d Bushkin glides through Carson\u2019s early years \u2014 born in Iowa, reared in Nebraska by a passive father and a toxic mother \u2014 to focus on the man at the top of his game. Wildly successful on television and in clubs, Carson was, in private, a roiling mass of contradictions. He could be \u201cendlessly witty and enormously fun,\u201d but also \u201cthe nastiest son of a bitch on earth. The truth is that he was an incredibly complex man: one moment gracious, funny, and generous; and curt, aloof and hard-hearted in the next. Never have I met a man possessed of a greater number of social gifts \u2014 intelligence, looks, manners, style, humor \u2014 and never have I met a man with less aptitude for or interest in maintaining real relationships.\u201d \n For Carson, the phrase \u201cfamily man\u201d was an oxymoron and fidelity impossible to maintain. Though he and his college-sweetheart first wife, Jody, had three boys, active fatherhood was not part of his DNA. Indeed, when Ricky, their middle child, was committed to Bellevue Hospital\u2019s psych unit for several months, Carson declined to visit on the grounds that his presence would \u201cmortify\u201d his son and create a media circus. That abdicated task fell to Bushkin. Carson was not close to the other children, either, although when Ricky died in a car crash in 1991, Carson paid him an emotional on-the-air tribute.   Being the comedian\u2019s wife was no picnic. One of Bushkin\u2019s early missions was a walk on the noir side, with a pistol-packing Carson leading \u201ca squad of men with downturned mouths and upturned collars through a rain-swept Manhattan evening\u201d into the secret love nest of his second wife, Joanne. He was furious and devastated to discover photos of Frank Gifford, the pro football great turned sportscaster, on a table and men\u2019s clothing in the closet of an apartment he was paying for. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Carson walked out and soon married divorcee Joanna Holland, who persuaded him to move the show, and Bushkin, to Los Angeles. Within three years, that marriage was over, too, and because Carson had gallantly ignored entreaties to sign a pre-nup, the breakup cost him $35 million, Bushkin writes, although other accounts put the figure somewhat lower. Carson and his fourth wife, Alex, 30 years his junior, separated well before his death. \n Bushkin, like many others, blames Carson\u2019s icy mother for her son\u2019s relationship woes, calling her the kind of parent \u201cwho inflicts consistent emotional pain\u201d because she is \u201cimpossible to impress and impossible to please. She seemed to take no pride or pleasure in her son\u2019s accomplishments.\u201d We\u2019ll let legal ethicists decide whether Bushkin has violated attorney-client privilege in sharing Carson stories, licit and illicit, or whether he has merely exercised his First Amendment right to cash in and lash out after losing nearly everything after their acrimonious break. Bushkin was sued for malpractice and held liable for Carson\u2019s failed business and real estate deals, and he spent four years litigating to clear his name, including a protracted trial. He just about broke even after recouping $17 million in a jury award and an insurance settlement. He had already lost his wife, Judy. She left him in the early \u201980s using celebrity divorce lawyer Arthur Crowley, who\u2019d secured the aforementioned whopping settlement for her dear friend, Joanna Carson. Doing business deals from California to Kyrgyzstan, Bushkin insists he\u2019s been happier since his firing than he ever was working for Carson.\n Even from the grave, however, Carson remains a looming presence who \u201ccontinues to provoke, irritate, delight, amuse and sadden me.\u201d But if all goes according to plan, and the book is a big seller, the King of Late Night may once again line the pockets of Bombastic Bushkin. \n \n\n Annie Groer \n is a Washington journalist who writes widely about culture, politics and design. \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n JOHNNY CARSON \n\n By Henry Bushkin Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. 294 pp. $28", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "Annie Groer", "wordCount": 940}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "\u2018Acts Passed at a First Congress of the United States of America 1789\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636572/s/3333db05/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Copinions0C20A130C110C0A10Cec9c60Afa0E3c220E11e30Eb6a90Eda62c264f40Ae0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibooks/story01.htm", "text": "History \n \n Acts Passed at a First Congress of the United States of America 1789 \n Andrews McMeel. 93 pp. $75 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The First Congress of the United States, which met in New York between March 4, 1789, and March 3, 1791\n , was the most consequential in the nation\u2019s history. It proposed 12 constitutional amendments, 10 of which became \n the Bill of Rights ; established much of the federal judiciary and the Departments of State, War and Treasury; enacted the republic\u2019s first patent and copyright laws; and granted George Washington the authority to locate the federal capital along the Potomac. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Now comes a handsome leather-bound facsimile of Washington\u2019s annotated copy of the laws passed during the first session of that important Congress. This edition, based on one printed in New York by Childs and Swaine, has an imitation sprinkled-calf cover with gold lettering and marbled end papers. Washington did little annotating, penciling \u201cPresident\u201d a few times in the margins, but the bills offer a fascinating glimpse of an infant and energetic republic getting on its feet.  The bills are models of brevity and clarity, far from today\u2019s opaque and lengthy laws. To wit: The judiciary act is just longer than 13 pages. The Treasury was established in two pages. By comparison, it took \n 187 pages to contain the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In total, the work of this first session of the first Congress, which addressed matters of surpassing magnitude, fills just 93 pages. Two hundred years later, the first session of the 101st Congress required 837 pages to deliver its laws. The 1789 volume is full of fascinating nuggets. For instance, Washington was paid $25,000 per anum while the vice president made $5,000. The chief justice of the United States made $4,000, associate justices $3,500. Members of Congress did not receive a salary \u2014 they were paid $6 per day during session plus travel expenses, with a strict requirment that they take the cheapest, most direct roads. No first class for this lot. Not only did this Congress lay the foundations of a country, but it found time to give a certain Baron de Glaubeck the pay of a captain of the Army, ensured pensions to \u201cinvalids who were wounded and disabled during the late war,\u201d and imposed duties on chocolate, Madeira wine, galoshes and lapsang souchong tea.\n Long before sequestration, fiscal cliffs and debt ceilings, Congress functioned admirably, just as the framers imagined it would. \n \u2014\u2009Timothy R.

Wodehouse\u2019s death, and when it is completed in 2015 it will run to a total of 97 volumes. It is a collaboration of the ancient Everyman\u2019s Library in the United Kingdom and the youthful Overlook Press in the United States. Peter Mayer, the publisher of Overlook Press, writes in a brochure about the series: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThe Collector\u2019s Wodehouse, when complete, will be the first complete hardback series of Wodehouse\u2019s works by any one publisher. In every case, the editor has gone back to the first edition of each book and corrected errors that had crept into the innumerable paperback editions. Each book has been re-typeset using that classic English typeface, Caslon. Further, these are printed on acid-free paper and are sewn and bound in full cloth. Andrzej Klimowski is the perfect illustrator for Wodehouse and both David Campbell [at Everyman\u2019s] and I are certain that no other Wodehouse collection will surpass or outlive this one.\u201d\n Publishers, like all other marketers, are given to hyperbole, but in this case there is ample reason for Mayer to boast about his firm\u2019s accomplishment. Fine bookmaking is mostly a lost art in publishing these days, but the volumes of the Collector\u2019s Wodehouse are fine indeed: sturdily bound, with Klimowski\u2019s witty and inviting illustrations on the dust wrappers and with the lines generously spaced inside, making for effortless reading with no design distractions. I am hard-pressed to think of a recent publishing project as ambitious and successful as this one. Viking did a \u201cUniform Edition\u201d of Graham Greene\u2019s works in the 1970s and \u201980s, but it stopped before Greene himself stopped, so it is incomplete and out of print; by contrast all of the Wodehouse volumes are in print and readily available. \n There does not seem to have been any particular scheme to the release of these titles, though priority seems to have been awarded to the Jeeves and Wooster novels and short stories; both \u201cRight Ho, Jeeves\u201d and \u201cThe Code of the Woosters\u201d were issued in 2000 and are among the 10 best-selling titles in the series. \u201cJeeves dominates, as expected,\u201d I\u2019m told by Jack Lamplough in Overlook\u2019s publicity department, \u201cbut we have had a lot of success with recent volumes such as \u2018Leave It to Psmith\u2019 and \u2018Aunts Aren\u2019t Gentlemen,\u2019\u2009\u201d though I hasten to point out that, in fact, the latter actually is a Jeeves and Wooster production. Lamplough also reports that \u201cUncle Fred in the Springtime\u201d is \u201c#26 in sales for our series,\u201d which surprises and disappoints me as I regard it as the best of all Wodehouse\u2019s books. \n On the other hand, what especially pleases me is that as the series nears completion, it gives no evidence of scraping the bottom of the barrel, indeed provides proof that Wodehouse\u2019s barrel had no bottom. A couple of titles published earlier this year, \u201cMike and Psmith\u201d and \u201cThe White Feather,\u201d came out originally in the early 1900s and can be classified as apprentice work, but certainly cannot be dismissed as such because they are the work of a master in the making. By now I have read several dozen of Wodehouse\u2019s novels and many of his stories; though some obviously are better than others, there isn\u2019t a bad one in the lot, or even a mediocre one, and overall they confirm the suspicion that Wodehouse was no mere comic novelist (if such a creature can be called \u201cmere\u201d) but one of the great prose stylists of the 20th century and a writer destined for immortality. \n   \u201cThe Small Bachelor\u201d was published in 1927, the same year as \u201cMeet Mr. Mulliner,\u201d by which point Wodehouse\u2019s fame had been secured; \u201cIf I Were You\u201d appeared in 1931, the same year as \u201cBig Money.\u201d Two books a year were scarcely out of the ordinary for the prolific Wodehouse, who also wrote plays and musicals and labored in the vineyards of Hollywood. The jacket of \u201cThe Small Bachelor\u201d informs us that it is \u201cbased on a 1917 musical comedy script by Wodehouse and his friend, Guy Bolton,\u201d and it is very much in the spirit of the 1920s Broadway stage. Set in New York \u2014 don\u2019t forget that Wodehouse first came to the States in the early 1900s and lived most of the rest of his life here \u2014 it is a typically zany romantic comedy involving George Finch, \u201ca nice young small bachelor, of the type you see bobbing about the place on every side,\u201d and Molly Waddington, with whom he falls in love over the fierce objections of her stepmother, who rates a classic Wodehouse portrait: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cMrs Sigsbee H. Waddington was a strong woman. In fact, so commanding was her physique that a stranger might have supposed her to be one in the technical, or circus, sense. She was not tall, but she had bulged so generously in every possible direction that, when seen for the first time, she gave the impression of enormous size. No theatre, however little its programme had managed to attract the public, could be said to be \u2018sparsely filled\u2019 if Mrs Waddington had dropped in to look at the show. Public speakers, when Mrs Waddington was present, had the illusion that they were addressing most of the population of the United States. And when she went to Carlsbad or Aix-les-Bains to take the waters, the authorities huddled together nervously and wondered if there would be enough to go round.\u201d \n That formidable woman is a stepmother rather than an aunt, but she immediately puts one in mind of Aunt Agatha, Bertie Wooster\u2019s fire-breathing relative, and all the other frightening aunts who populate Wodehouse\u2019s novels. The novel also includes a butler named Mullett, who, though an American ex-convict, manages to sound exactly like Jeeves (\u201cI suppose the English country\u2019s nice?\u201d \u201cI believe it gives uniform satisfaction, sir\u201d), and a fortune-teller named Eulalie, a name that will ring happy bells for anyone who has read, and therefore loves, \u201cThe Code of the Woosters.\u201d \n As for \u201cIf I Were You,\u201d it is the tale of a handsome young English lord and a cockney barber, and the strange twists of familial attachments that bind them in highly unlikely and decidedly hilarious ways. Wodehouse manages to work a lawyer into the plot, for he loved lawyers approximately as much as did his great predecessor Charles Dickens, and he seized every chance to have fun at their expense: \u201c[The] description of Mr. J.G. Wetherby, of the legal firm of Polk, Wetherby, Polk and Polk, as an old bloke with a face like a halibut had been, if not entirely justified, at any rate reasonably close to the mark. The solicitor was well stricken in years, and his large, glassy eyes, peering through their spectacles, did suggest those of some kind of fish. He came in now in that wary manner peculiar to lawyers, looking from side to side as if expecting to see torts hiding behind the curtains and misdemeanours under the piano.\u201d \n Both of these novels presumably did well enough when first released, but both subsequently faded into the mists as their author\u2019s fame came to rest on the novels and stories featuring his most celebrated and beloved creations: Jeeves and Wooster, Lord Elmsley, Uncle Fred, Mr. Mulliner et al. Yet they offer almost as many delights as such classics as, oh, \u201cJoy in the Morning\u201d and \u201cBlandings Castle,\u201d which is to say they are Wodehouse through and through. I can think of nothing better. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n THE SMALL BACHELOR \n\n By P.G. Wodehouse Overlook. 287 pp. $19.95 \n\n IF I WERE YOU \n\n By P.G.

Doctorow\u2019s \u201c Ragtime ,\u201d in which fictional characters rubbed shoulders with everyone from Harry Houdini and Sigmund Freud to Stanford White and Archduke Ferdinand. The wild success of that 1975 book threw a new doubt into the minds of historical novelists everywhere. Were they shortchanging their readers by not trotting out the rich and famous? Were they shortchanging themselves by not employing celebrities as readily available signifiers of whatever theme they were working up? So it is with Kevin Baker\u2019s \u201c The Big Crowd ,\u201d the latest in his boisterous novels about New York City. But unlike \u201cRagtime,\u201d where the fictional and real-life characters carry about equal weight, in Baker\u2019s new book, the historical figures have taken over. Only three important characters are not straight from the history books \u2014 and actually, those three come from the history books, too. Their names are changed, that\u2019s about all \u2014 perhaps because Baker doesn\u2019t feel entirely comfortable about the accusations that unfold about them over the course of the story. At any rate, \u201cThe Big Crowd\u201d features a very big crowd indeed of famous Americans (mostly New Yorkers) from the first half of the 20th century. They\u2019re cops and robbers, politicians and other crooks, including Robert Moses, Frank Costello, Cardinal Spellman, Peter Panto, Fiorello LaGuardia, Albert Anastasia, Joseph P. Ryan and Toots Shor. In one scene, high rollers at a raucous dinner party are treated to silent cameos by Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra all at once, just to make them feel good about themselves. \n But back to those three central characters with the changed names. We have Charlie O\u2019Kane (whom you may recognize as New York Mayor William O\u2019Dwyer), Tom O\u2019Kane (O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s younger brother, Paul), and Slim Sadler (Sloan Simpson, the Texas socialite who married one of them). The O\u2019Kanes and Sadler do more or less as the real O\u2019Dwyers and the real Simpson did, with the possible exception of certain activities relating to the mysterious death of the mob informant Abe \u201cKid Twist\u201d Reles, who appears here, like pretty much everybody else in the world, under his own name. At least until he goes out the high window of that seedy Coney Island hotel. The plot, and there\u2019s enough of it, plays out among Sadler (who has \u201ceyes you could fall into\u201d) and the brothers O\u2019Kane as they fight the mob killers of what came to be known as Murder, Inc. There are secrets and revelations, promises and betrayals, each one either personal or political or somewhere in between. There\u2019s obfuscation and concealment on the part of the author, which is to be expected in a novel that plays out over a fragmented timeline spanning 15 years or so. Some readers will struggle with the willfully jagged chronology, but Baker manages this well. He only falters when still-deeper exposition is required, and one of the O\u2019Kane brothers stops the action to tell the other a long bit of back story that both of them must already know by heart, as in this example: \u201c\u2009\u2018I know. I remember how you looked, kiddo,\u2019 Charlie said softly, patting his shoulder, \u2018President Roosevelt sent me over the same summer you were there, an\u2019 Jimmy was in France.\u2019\u2009\u201d Note, by the way, that telltale \u201can\u2019.\u201d The O\u2019Kane brothers are Irish, you remember, straight from the old sod. They never forget it, and Baker doesn\u2019t want you to forget it either, so they drop a terminal \u201cd\u201d every now and then. Regardless of all that, readers with an interest in the political history of New York, especially those intrigued by the Murder, Inc. prosecutions that serve as a backdrop to these goings-on, will find enough here to like \u201cThe Big Crowd.\u201d Along with much that\u2019s comfortably familiar. \n Clinch is the author of the novels \u201cFinn,\u201d \u201cKings of the Earth\u201d and \u201cThe Thief of Auschwitz.\u201d", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "Jon Clinch", "wordCount": 655}, {"date": "2013-10-31 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Book review: \u2018Days of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House\u2019 by Peter Baker", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636572/s/33282bec/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Copinions0Cbook0Ereview0Edays0Eof0Efire0Ebush0Eand0Echeney0Ein0Ethe0Ewhite0Ehouse0Eby0Epeter0Ebaker0C20A130C10A0C310Cc8ca470Aa0E26150E11e30Eb3e90Ed97fb0A87acd60Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibooks/story01.htm", "text": "James Mann, a resident fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is the author of \u201cRise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush\u2019s War Cabinet.\u201d He is working on a biography of George W. Bush for the American Presidents series. \n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t We are in the midst of a wave of revisionism about George W. Bush and his administration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t For years, amid the rancor of the Iraq war, Bush was often portrayed as a simple idiot or sometimes as a demonic manipulator. More recently, amid an outpouring of coverage prompted by the opening in April of the George W. Bush Presidential Library in Dallas, we have been treated to even thinner caricatures of W.: Bush the humanist, a quietly contemplative painter who was misunderstood at the time and did little to inspire the passions that engulfed him. This recent rethinking will prove no more enduring than the original perceptions. The long-term historical judgments of the Bush administration are only beginning to take shape. It has taken several years for the key actors to write their memoirs and for the president\u2019s friends and subordinates to offer stories they wouldn\u2019t volunteer at the time the Bush team was in the White House. Peter Baker\u2019s impressive new book, \u201cDays of Fire,\u201d one of the first efforts to set out the history of the Bush administration, is a distinguished work, notable for its scope and ambition, that should become a standard reference for historians. After tracing the upbringing and early careers of both Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney, Baker chronicles their time in office from start to finish, encompassing their foreign and domestic policies. (The book\u2019s title is a play on a quote from Bush\u2019s second inaugural address: Referring to Sept. 11, 2001, the president said, \u201cAnd then there came a day of fire.\u201d) The book has few groundbreaking revelations or startling judgments. Its virtue lies in the mass of information Baker has collected and the way he has pulled it together, so that the jumble of material on the Bush years is consolidated in one smooth narrative. He has read the memoirs so you don\u2019t have to. From them he unearths gems, such as Bush\u2019s quip about the icy reception he would get when addressing the United Nations General Assembly: \u201cIt\u2019s like speaking to the wax museum. Nobody moves.\u201d (This comes from former spokesman Ari Fleischer\u2019s memoir). Baker also gathers a wealth of other revealing quotes and anecdotes, not previously published, from interviews and from private notes of White House meetings. \u201cWrite this down,\u201d Bush told Republican governors in the fall of 2002. \u201cAfghanistan and Iraq will lead that part of the world toward democracy.\u201d\n The heart of \u201cDays of Fire\u201d lies in the changing relationship between Bush and Cheney \u2014 how Bush in the early years of his administration relied heavily on his vastly more experienced vice president, but during his second term he increasingly operated on his own, relegating Cheney to the margins. Baker draws out each development in this tangled relationship in much the same way that Robert Caro wrote about the relationship between John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. In this, Baker sometimes succeeds, yet his approach has some flaws, too. The book is overwhelmingly event-driven and chronological. On occasion, it reads too much like a tick-tock of Bush\u2019s eight years in office, dwelling on time and detail until it becomes eye-numbing: When Bush has a routine colonoscopy in 2002 and transfers power to Cheney for a couple of hours, Baker informs the reader that the White House physician \u201cperformed the procedure, finishing at 7:29 a.m. without finding any polyps. Bush awoke at 7:31, got up soon thereafter, ate a waffle and played with his dogs.\u201d This is simply too much information.   The book dwells more on the personalities in the Bush administration than on the ideas and larger forces at work. Baker depicts the relationship between Cheney and Secretary of State Colin Powell as an old friendship turned sour; Powell had been Cheney\u2019s \u201conce-trusted sidekick during the first Bush presidency,\u201d he writes. This is doubly off-kilter: Powell, both as a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan and as the most powerful chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the nation had ever known, was anything but Cheney\u2019s sidekick; his stature and influence in George H.W. Bush\u2019s White House engendered considerable mistrust on the part of Cheney and top civilian aides such as Paul Wolfowitz and Scooter Libby. At the root of this mistrust was the fact that Cheney and Powell represented different ideas about America\u2019s post-Cold War role in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t When the two men returned to office under George W. Bush, they brought with them these distinct worldviews. In addition, each man (particularly Cheney) installed a network of allies and supporters who reflected his beliefs. Amid these larger conflicts, the personal relationship between Cheney and Powell was almost irrelevant; it was bound to be strained. Baker\u2019s careful reconstruction gives readers a good sense of the day-to-day flow of the Bush administration. He describes the events as the White House saw them \u2014 switching often, in short order, from one subject to another, with Baker drawing the connection that \u201ceven as\u201d one thing was happening, another was. \u201cThe economic crisis began to worsen dramatically the day after [Adm. Fox] Fallon\u2019s resignation,\u201d he writes in one typical passage, leaving time as the sole connector between unrelated events. \u201cDays of Fire\u201d makes far too little effort to separate the wheat from the chaff. Events of historic consequence, such as the Bush tax cuts, are given comparable treatment with White House staff feuds and minor personnel changes that had little significance at the time and none at all by now. Why should we care about the conflicts between, say, political strategists Matthew Dowd and Karl Rove, or between press secretary Dana Perino and one of her predecessors, Scott McClellan? Such material distracts from the important story Baker has to tell about the administration\u2019s leading actors and about events including the Iraq war.\n The final verdict on the Bush administration, of course, remains to be written. After nearly five years of the Obama administration, some of Bush\u2019s counterterrorism policies \u2014 the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for example \u2014 have proved more lasting than they seemed when he left office. It will take years, perhaps decades, to judge what Bush\u2019s tax cuts did to America\u2019s economic and social structure. Over time, we will be able to see just how badly the war in Iraq eroded American power and damaged its international standing. \u201cDays of Fire\u201d doesn\u2019t try to make these larger assessments. It is, however, as thorough and detailed an account of the Bush years \u2014 day by day, week by week \u2014 as we are ever likely to get. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n DAYS OF FIRE \n\n \n\n Bush and Cheney in the White House \n\n By Peter Baker Doubleday. 800 pp. $35", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "James Mann", "wordCount": 1140}, {"date": "2013-10-30 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Scary writers\u2019 plans for Halloween", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636572/s/331eab90/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cbooks0Cscary0Ewriters0Eplans0Efor0Ehalloween0C20A130C10A0C30A0Cbf861620A0E41940E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibooks/story01.htm", "text": "What do people who scare us for a living do on Halloween?

Yet \u201cThe Daylight Gate\u201d is more than a shivery treat: This harrowing novel, set in early-17th-century England, touches on nearly every aspect of witchcraft, both historical and imaginative. In little more than 200 pages, Jeanette Winterson depicts starving hags, gorgeous Renaissance orgies, alchemists searching for the secret of eternal life, horrific torture and even the Dark Gentleman himself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Much of the story, moreover, is true. As Winterson notes in her introduction, \u201cThe Trial of the Lancashire Witches, 1612, is the most famous of the English witch trials.\u201d For her characters \u2014 Alice Nutter, Mother Demdike, magistrate Roger Nowell and others \u2014 she draws on the contemporary account of Thomas Potts, author of \u201cThe Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancashire.\u201d Some readers may recall that this document also served as the basis for \u201cThe Lancashire Witches,\u201d a once-celebrated 19th-century novel by W. Harrison Ainsworth . Yet that book, though powerful, is garrulous and long-winded, while \u201cThe Daylight Gate\u201d proffers a series of short, sharp shocks. It opens on Pendle Hill, one of the most haunted sites in England: \u201cThe hill itself is low and massy, flat-topped, brooding, disappeared in mists, treacherous with bogs, run through with fast-flowing streams plunging into waterfalls crashing down into unknown pools. Underfoot is the black rock that is the spine of this place. \u201cSheep graze. Hares stand like question marks. \u201cThere are no landmarks for the traveller. Too early or too late the mist closes in. Only a fool or one who has dark business should cross Pendle at night.\u201d \n Nonetheless, late one afternoon a fat peddler named John Law is taking a shortcut through Pendle Forest near what they call Boggart\u2019s Hole. He is hurrying along because the light has begun to thin and fade. \u201cSoon it would be dusk; the liminal hour \u2014 the Daylight Gate. He did not want to step through the light into whatever lay beyond the light.\u201d But suddenly, Law is confronted by Alizon Device, who asks for a kiss, followed by her \u201cgrand-dam\u201d Old Demdike, who begins to curse him. Frightened, Law runs to the inn at Newchurch in Pendle, where he collapses, dying, while holding up three fingers and murmuring a single word: \u201cDemdike.\u201d In due course, the local authorities round up some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the Demdike clan and throw them into the Well Dungeon of Lancaster Castle. In that hellhole, the jailer regularly rapes the younger women, who are grateful that he first allows them to wash up a little. Are the prisoners, as one suspects, simply scapegoats, victims of the period\u2019s rabid fear of sorcery? Are they nothing more than deluded, hungry peasants? That\u2019s what Alice\n, one of the region\u2019s richest landowners, maintains. \u201cSuch women are poor,\u201d she tells the well-meaning magistrate, Roger Nowell. \u201cThey are ignorant. They have no power in your world, so they must get what power they can in theirs. I have sympathy for them.\u201d As the only benefactor of the Demdikes, Alice allows the family to squat in the decaying Malkin Tower on her land. Alice, herself, knows what it is to be poor. But, long ago, she created a deep magenta dye that took the fancy of Queen Elizabeth and earned her a fortune. Still surprisingly youthful and beautiful, Alice is widely respected, and Roger Nowell is clearly smitten with her. Nonetheless, there is something mysterious about her past.   Besides being a reputed haven for witches, Lancashire in those days was also a recusant Catholic stronghold. To Potts, King James\u2019s government agent, sorcery and popery naturally travel hand in hand. He yearns to capture the Lancashire-born Christopher Southworth, who participated in the Gunpowder Plot to blow up Parliament but somehow managed to escape after fearful torture and mutilation. To this end, Potts throws Christopher\u2019s sister Jane into the dungeon with the Demdikes, hoping that her renegade Catholic brother will return from Europe and try to rescue her. Witches and papists \u2014 what\u2019s the difference? They should all be hanged or burned at the stake. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Up to this point, the reader of \u201cThe Daylight Gate\u201d is gripped by the realistic horrors and brutality Winterson describes. With the exception of the magistrate, only Alice speaks up for tolerance, clear-thinking and charity. None of this witchcraft nonsense for her, right? Right? But what, then, of the elixir that she rubs regularly on her skin? What of the falcon that comes to her when she whistles? What of her association, years before, with the alchemist Dr. John Dee and the strange mirror she then created? What, above all, of the letter she treasures from the medium Edward Kelley, the letter that reads, \u201cAnd if thou callest him, like unto an angel of the north wearing a dark costume, he will hear thee and come to thee. Yet meet him where he may be met \u2014 at the Daylight Gate.\u201d Is Alice herself a witch, then \u2014 and even, as the youngest Demdike proclaims, \u201cthe most powerful of them all\u201d? Throughout \u201cThe Daylight Gate,\u201d Winterson plays several sorts of peekaboo with the reader. Witchcraft is obviously just superstition \u2014 but then it works. Alice obviously possesses an elixir of youth \u2014 or maybe she simply eats right and takes good care of herself. Unlike Elizabeth Southern, the gorgeous woman she loved when she was younger, Alice categorically refuses to sign away her soul to the devil. At the same time, she also loves, and is loved by, Christopher, who has become a Jesuit priest. Alice\u2019s life, like those of our modern superheroes, is complicated. Halfway through \u201cThe Daylight Gate,\u201d Alice attends a special performance of \u201cThe Tempest\u201d at Hoghton Tower. There she meets its author, now retired, who offers her some advice: \u201cI have written,\u201d says Shakespeare, \u201cabout other worlds often enough. I have said what I can say. There are many kinds of reality. This is but one kind.\u201d He then \u201cstretched out his hands to indicate the walls, carpets, tapestries and stuffs around him\u201d before adding: \u201cBut, Mistress, do not be seen to stray too far from the real that is clear to others, or you may stand accused of the real that is clear to you.\u201d This is enigmatic, even for the Bard. But Winterson neatly shifts back and forth among various \u201crealities\u201d throughout \u201cThe Daylight Gate.\u201d Yet she never tries to dazzle the reader, keeping her sentences sober, precise and solemnly beautiful as the novel moves along with a steady relentlessness. Will a desperate Alice finally take \u201cthe Left-Hand Path\u201d? From the beginning, one naturally foresees a sad ending \u2014 the historical record is there, after all \u2014 and yet the book closes on quite a different note. Throughout, Alice remains as admirable as she is dauntless: At least twice she thwarts the Dark Gentleman, and she is willing to face torture and worse to rescue her beloved Elizabeth from damnation and to save Christopher from the powers of this world.

He spoke by phone about his new book, \u201c Doomed \u201d (Doubleday, $24.95), a comic-spooky sequel to his 2011 bestseller, \u201c Damned ,\u201d about a 13\u00ad-year-old girl in hell. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n Where do you get the inspiration for all these crazy stories? \n\n Usually, someone tells me a story that I find so striking or so compelling that I have to share it with other people \u2014 and then those other people tell me a version of it from their own lives. I just cherry-pick the very best versions of the same experience and find a way of quilting them together. \n\n That makes it sound like your fiction is realistic. \n\n My degree is in journalism, so a lot of it is just looking for key elements of stories and finding the patterns that exist between them. They\u2019re stories from people\u2019s lives because those are the most unfiltered, freshest. Usually, they have some cultural precedent, but they\u2019re something I\u2019ve never seen anywhere before. That always hooks me. \n\n Do you then have to make their stories more fantastical? \n\n I have to make them less fantastical. \n\n In your new novel, \u201cDoomed,\u201d a girl named Madison emerges from hell to get stuck in purgatory, which is Earth. Where did that come from? \n\n I started writing the book when I was taking care of my mother, who died of lung cancer in 2009. When she died, my family had left the Catholic Church so many decades before that we really didn\u2019t have a ritual for dealing with her passing. We didn\u2019t have a blueprint for those human ceremonies that have to take place. So I wanted to play with the idea of heaven and hell, because we\u2019ve given up the kind of standard Catholic idea of heaven and hell. \n\n Madison finds out that God exists. What do you believe? \n\n I\u2019m sure God exists. Arguing that God doesn\u2019t exist would be like people in the 10th century arguing that germs and microbes didn\u2019t exist because they couldn\u2019t see them. \n\n I\u2019ve often wondered how teenagers today rebel against \u201ccool\u201d parents who went to Woodstock and saw Led Zeppelin. Is this a question behind your new novel? \n\n That\u2019s a big part. Before my final rewrite, I had a huge Woodstock section, which my editor asked me to take out. In a way, Madison\u2019s snarkiness is a rejection of her parents\u2019 earnestness, and there was something earnest about that Woodstock generation. Maybe that\u2019s why subsequent generations have been so bitter and ironic. \n\n In \u201cDoomed,\u201d you write, \u201cAll progress is the product of the unpopular.\u201d Is this your defense of the uncool? \n\n No, it\u2019s a statement of truth. My teacher Tom Spanbauer, the man who got me started writing in his workshop, used to say: \u201cWriters write because they weren\u2019t invited to a party.\u201d That always struck so true, and people always nod their heads when they hear that. Especially writers. \n\n Are you uncool?\n \n\n I am enormously uncool. I\u2019ve made a cottage industry of being uncool. And I\u2019m fine with that.Especially when you\u2019re dealing with young people, if you can go up there and risk being uncool, then you give them the freedom to be uncool. \n\n Reading this book makes me think that you have a blast writing. Is that true? \n\n I do, and that\u2019s another Tom Spanbauer teaching \u2014 that you should have a huge amount of fun writing. You should also be dealing with some very personal, threatening issues so you get your paycheck at the front end. You get therapy, and you get fun. Because chances are you\u2019re never going to get paid for it. \n\n I understand that you\u2019re working on a sequel to \u201c Fight Club \u201d as a graphic novel. Why that form? \n\n Chelsea Cain, who writes best-selling thrillers, has been sort of the midwife, introducing me to a lot of graphic novel people she knows from DC and Marvel and Dark Horse. They\u2019ve all been whispering in my ear about how great a form it would be for \u201cFight Club.\u201d My publisher\u2019s been shipping me to Comic-Cons, and it seems that my readership overlaps perfectly with the Comic-Con crowd. So I thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d It\u2019s like storyboarding a movie. It\u2019s fun. It won\u2019t be published for a while, and we\u2019ll probably bring it out in installments, rather than book form. \n\n And now you\u2019re off to a slumber party in New Orleans with 800 people? \n\n Chelsea Cain, Monica Drake and I have put together these late-night, very adult slumber party events. We had 900 people in Tulsa; Baltimore\u2019s sold out. Everyone wears pajamas, and a lot of people bring pillows and sleeping bags. As they enter, I give them a two-foot-diameter beach ball to blow up, which comes with glow sticks that go inside the beach ball. Periodically, we shut off every light in the place so it\u2019s pitch-black, and people throw hundreds of brightly glowing two-foot orbs in the air, and people just gasp. I ask for a show of hands: \u201cWho\u2019s ever been to an author\u2019s event?\u201d At least half have never been \u2014 usually 80\u00a0percent. So this is their first time seeing an author. And I really want it to be extraordinary so maybe they\u2019ll go to somebody else\u2019s event. \n\n And be bitterly disappointed! \n\n Well, maybe we can raise the bar. \n Burns is editor of \u201c Off the Page : Writers Talk About Beginnings, Endings, and Everything in Between.\u201d She teaches at Cardiff Metropolitan University in Britain.", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "Carole Burns", "wordCount": 905}, {"date": "2013-10-29 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "\u2018We Are Water,\u2019 by Wally Lamb", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636572/s/3310d4f3/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cbooks0Cwe0Eare0Ewater0Eby0Ewally0Elamb0C20A130C10A0C290Ca2719ec80E3cea0E11e30Eb6a90Eda62c264f40Ae0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibooks/story01.htm", "text": "Gay Americans have been waiting a long time for the right to marry. But we all wait a long time in Wally Lamb\u2019s dilatory new novel about a lesbian wedding. Before anybody is allowed to say, \u201cI do,\u201d in \u201cWe Are Water,\u201d a whole family of injured people must walk down the aisle muttering their sorrows. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Emotional and physical wounds have long been Lamb\u2019s territory, explored in the Oprah-blessed blockbusters \u201cShe\u2019s Come Undone\u201d and \u201cI Know This Much Is True\u201d and his wrenching novel about the Columbine shooting, \u201cThe Hour I First Believed.\u201d But despite its vast registry of topical troubles, \u201cWe Are Water\u201d still feels like something borrowed, something blue.   The story comes to us as a series of soliloquies delivered \u2014 chapter by chapter \u2014 by the distressed members of the Oh family. The patriarch is Orion Oh, an affable psychologist descended from a Chinese grandfather with \u201cinscrutable eyes.\u201d Orion has endured a rough year: He\u2019s been forced into early retirement by a sexual harassment claim, and his wife has left him for a woman. Unsettled by these developments, he decides to get away and collect his thoughts. It\u2019s to be a \u201csummer\u2019s worth of drifting and wound licking,\u201d he says. \u201cFigure out how to shed my bitterness, forgive myself and others and start over. Orchestrate a reinvention.\u201d So he\u2019s driving to Cape Cod to spend a month in a vacation home owned by his ex-wife\u2019s bride-to-be. This may seem like an odd or even an inscrutable setting in which to recover from the shock of your wife\u2019s lesbianism, but it\u2019s not the novel\u2019s most contrived coincidence. As Orion recollects the start and dissolution of his 27-year marriage, we periodically break away to hear from his ex-wife, Annie. She\u2019s an artist whose trash-collages emerge from \u201cthe blast furnace of her pent-up rage.\u201d She\u2019s angry because she was sexually abused as a child and because her husband never helped out around the house. On the plus side, that animus has inspired her to create pieces that attract critical praise and lucrative sales: One of her most famous sculptures, \u201cBirthings,\u201d shows a \u201crow of headless mannequins, their bloody legs spread wide, their wombs expelling serial killers. Speck. Bundy. Gacy. Monsters all.\u201d But beneath that fame and success is a woman confused about her violent behavior as a mother and her upcoming marriage to a female gallery owner. \u201cI kind of thought I might be a lesbian,\u201d Annie tells us. \u201cWhich, maybe I am. But maybe not. Maybe I\u2019m .\u2009.\u2009. what do they call it? AC/DC?\u201d \n Maybe. Eventually, we hear soliloquies from the Ohs\u2019 three unhappy adult children, a couple of neighbors and even Annie\u2019s old sexual abuser. Together they present an exhaustive inventory of woe: teenage pregnancy, miscarriage, prostitution, racism, paraplegia, divorce, abandonment, homophobia, lynching, alcoholism, drug abuse, child abuse, depression, panic attacks, drowning, robbery, assault, murder, Charlie Sheen. When one of the characters on the beach asks, \u201cHe\u2019s hurt? Was it those sharks?\u201d the list of perils finally seems complete. There\u2019s even an African American ghost lurking around in the Ohs\u2019 backyard \u2014 the spectral residue of one too many tragedies haunting this tragedy-packed novel. The problem with \u201cWe Are Water,\u201d though, isn\u2019t an excess of trauma, it\u2019s a dearth of immediacy and subtlety. The present-day action of the novel is overwhelmed by recollections. Some of these memories are genuinely thrilling. There\u2019s a deadly flood scene, for instance, that roars right off the page. But most of the novel is burdened with inconsequential detail \u2014 usually conveyed by banal voices that are too knowing and irony-free. Every one of these characters is subjected to the pop-psych maxim that \u201cWe\u2019re only as sick as our secrets.\u201d And so, out all their secrets must come, every phobia, weakness and self-destructive habit traced back with a black magic marker to a rape or a punch or a lie. But do you want to know the most distracting verbal tic all these characters share? Would you believe that they all sprinkle their monologues with rhetorical questions? Does it make all the voices in his novel sound alike? Is it a particularly awkward way to provoke exposition? Sometimes, one of these anxious people raises a truly provocative question, but usually they try to stump us with questions such as: \u201cWhose parents are perfect? Who\u2019s not carrying around baggage from childhood?\u201d Or this head-scratcher: \u201cI get up, start the vacuum. The front foyer sure needs it; it\u2019s picking up a ton of sand. Then why am I stopping? Turning the damn thing off and yanking the plug?\u201d \n \n\n I don\u2019t know! \n\n Lamb is always a writer of deep compassion, and there\u2019s never any doubt about his conviction that healing is possible.

Tallis is an English clinical psychologist and novelist who, in recent years, has published an excellent series about a crime-solving psychiatrist in the glittering Vienna of the early 20th century. His new novel, \u201c The Sleep Room ,\u201d is a departure from that, and not only because it\u2019s set in 1950s England. Tallis\u2019s publisher calls the novel \u201ca brilliant reinvention of the ghost story.\u201d I won\u2019t dispute that, being largely ignorant of ghost stories that don\u2019t involve Casper, but will report that I found the novel fascinating. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Reading it, I kept recalling movies from my youth that invariably began with a young man and woman approaching a gloomy old house, or perhaps a castle in Transylvania, where alarming, ever-worsening events would transpire \u2014 creaking doors, organ music, sinister servants, fiendish laughter \u2014 until even we 12-year-olds were screaming, \u201cGet out of there!\u201d as the innocents stumbled toward some horrid fate. Tallis writes at a more sophisticated level than that, but there are moments in \u201cThe Sleep Room\u201d when even a reader of stout heart and mature years will be pleading with his hero to flee the nightmare that surrounds him.  At the outset, James Richardson, a young doctor, is interviewed by Dr. Hugh Maitland, \u201cthe most influential psychiatrist of his generation,\u201d who hires him to live and work at his hospital, Wyldehope Hall, in rural Suffolk. Arriving in the dead of night, Richardson finds the hospital \u201csituated on a bleak heath.\u201d He is greeted by the pounding of the North Sea; the hospital\u2019s caretaker, \u201ca big man with a pockmarked face and bulbous features\u201d; and a dimly lit vestibule that features a stag\u2019s head \u201cwith glassy black eyes.\u201d The organ music we must supply ourselves. He is soon introduced to the Sleep Room, where six women in white gowns, with wires protruding from their scalps, are kept in a drugged sleep for 21 hours a day, often for months at a time, to be studied by Richardson and Maitland. Maitland scorns Freudians and their talk therapy (\u201ccouch merchants,\u201d he calls them) but believes that this narcosis, or deep-sleep therapy, supplemented by electroshock treatments, can cure mental disorders. (This therapy, the author says in an afterword, was practiced in the 1950s but then fell out of favor.) Other patients in the hospital are confined in locked wards and heavily drugged to deal with their various forms of psychosis and depression. Richardson becomes increasingly troubled by the treatments inflicted upon these unfortunates. When he learns that Maitland has contacts at the CIA, he wonders if the sleeping women might be guinea pigs in a mind-control experiment. Things look up when an attractive nurse starts slipping into Richardson\u2019s room at night, but by day, he is increasingly alarmed by mysterious events at the hospital. A pen rolls off a flat desk. A missing ring is found where it should not be. Unseen beings go bump in the night. Soon he is unnerved by \u201cthe leaping shadows, slamming doors and ghostly apparitions. All of these things seemed to belong to another world, a world of fevered dreams and lunacy.\u201d He begins to fear there may be ghosts abroad in Wyldehope Hall, but he soldiers on, even after two terrible deaths, because he thinks his work with the celebrated Dr. Maitland can make his career. Eventually, all hell breaks loose, and we and Richardson are desperate to know just who or what is causing these inexplicable, perhaps evil, outbursts. The increasingly sinister Maitland? The brooding caretaker? The creepy head nurse, Sister Jenkins? A vengeful inmate? Or might there truly be poltergeists at large? We readers may entertain yet another possibility: that young Dr. Richardson may be an unreliable narrator. Who knows what perverse tricks a diabolical author might have up his sleeve? The solution to this puzzle, when it comes, is ingenious and entirely satisfactory. I prefer Tallis\u2019s Vienna novels \u2014 \u201c Fatal Lies ,\u201d \u201c A Death in Vienna \u201d and \u201c Vienna Blood \u201d \u2014 but he has crafted a skillful exercise in neo-Gothic horror. If you\u2019d like to spend some time in a fictional madhouse \u2014 as opposed to a nonfictional madhouse wherein strange beings conspire to bring down the government \u2014 \u201cThe Sleep Room\u201d might provide welcome relief. \n Anderson regularly reviews mysteries and thrillers for Book World. \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t THE SLEEP ROOM By F.

Not much happened in that book, but its setting \u2014 Nideck Point, the \nCalifornia mansion that Reuben inherits under mysterious circumstances \u2014 and its charming werewolf elders made up for the underpowered plot. There were intriguing glimpses of the ancient history of the Morphenkinder and a tantalizing promise of darker revelations to come. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But none of that earns out in \u201c The Wolves of Midwinter ,\u201d the second book in Rice\u2019s Wolf Gift Chronicles. Dubbed the Man Wolf by the popular press, Reuben only attacks evildoers, especially pedophiles, because who could feel bad about eating a pedophile? Early in \u201cThe Wolves of Midwinter,\u201d Reuben saves a little girl named Susie from a serial killer; he then brings her, wrapped in a bloodstained blanket, to a rectory where a kindly older woman with a \u201csimple no-nonsense face\u201d sits eating \u201cher lonely meal\u201d and reading (perhaps from the screenplay for \u201c Night of the Hunter \u201d). Completely unperturbed by the sight of the Man Wolf, Pastor Corrie takes in little Susie, wags a finger at the girl\u2019s hirsute savior and bids him leave before crazed rednecks come after him. Susie cries, \u201cYou saved my life, Man Wolf!\u201d\n \u201cHe turned back to her. For a long moment he gazed at her, her strong upturned face, the quiet steady fire in her eyes. \u2018You\u2019re going to be all right, Susie,\u2019 he said. \u2018I love you, darling dear.\u2019 And then he was gone.\u201d\n At this point, it would take a reader with a sterner heart than mine not to reach for a silver bullet. Rice\u2019s work has often dealt with the efforts to create and sustain a family or tribe: Lestat \n and his vampire cohort, generations of Mayfair witches in the American South, even the erotic adventurer Beauty and her lovers in Rice\u2019s pseudonymous A.N. Roquelaure novels. \u201cThe Wolves of Midwinter\u201d features two clans: a human one consisting of Reuben, his parents and Reuben\u2019s priest brother, Jim; and the supernatural Morphenkinder, whose ranks now include Reuben\u2019s lover, Laura. The tale takes place during the Christmas season, as the Morphenkinder plan a huge midwinter bash at Reuben\u2019s estate. Everyone, human and supernatural, is invited to the party. (And I mean everyone \u2014 the Vienna Boys\u2019 Choir is flown in for the event.) The Forest Gentry (don\u2019t call them \u201cfairies\u201d) also show up along with a European branch of the Morphenkinder, whose white-haired leader regales everyone with \u201cstories of Midwinter customs the world over \u2014 of ancient times and human sacrifice!\u201d\n All of this might lead you to believe that some creepy fun is in the offing, a Mendocino version of \u201c The Wicker Man .\u201d Instead, there are pages and pages of numbing description of an over-the-top gala where the guests are not just beautifully dressed in cashmere, velvet and vintage Chanel, but uniformly beautiful. In fact, despite a few gorgeous Morphenkinder of sinister intent, \u201cThe Wolves of Midwinter\u201d disturbingly identifies goodness with beauty. Everyone is beautiful, with the exception of evildoers like the sniveling, sobbing, craven, bald, bespectacled men \u2014 pedophiles all \u2014 devoured by the Morphenkinder in a feeding binge. The queasy moral equation extends to the trappings of wealth: Reuben and his friends, supernatural and human, all have perfectly appointed homes, clothing, hair. This becomes especially ludicrous when \nReuben and the desperate Father Jim go into hiding at the Fairmont Hotel, and readers get a rundown on their luxurious accommodations. I was surprised not to learn the thread count of the sheets. As for plot, there is only a series of setpieces and occasional supernatural intrusions, all too neatly resolved. Everyone gets off the hook, except for slimy pedophiles and drug dealers. True, Reuben himself is briefly haunted by the ghost of a dead female lover whose wardrobe changes with each spectral appearance. (Do ghosts even wear clothes?) But the helpful Forest Gentry encourage the ghost to go wherever it is ghosts go. Somewhere nice, I think; maybe the Fairmont? That visiting pack of decadent European Morphenkinder seems like it might stir up some trouble at the werewolves\u2019 annual yuletide bonfire, what with all that talk of human sacrifice.

That\u2019s the question at the thumping heart of Justin Kramon\u2019s new thriller, \u201c The Preservationist .\u201d Set on the campus of fictional Stradler College, the story features a shy freshman named Julia who belongs to that hardy breed of suspense heroines inclined to take solitary walks at midnight and linger in empty dormitories even after two undergraduates have been assaulted. In addition to its poor public-safety record, Stradler College has enrolled more than its share of weirdos, all of them intent on invading Julia\u2019s personal space. Even worse, one of her sketchy suitors turns out to be minoring in serial killing, although his transcript looks squeaky clean. If Julia doesn\u2019t crack this guy\u2019s cover fast, she\u2019s likely to join his sorority of victims and earn herself a permanent \u201cIncomplete.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThe Preservationist\u201d is a simple thriller in which plot rules. Kramon doesn\u2019t tax readers with atmosphere or character development. In fact, Freudian Theory 101 suffices to flesh out all the players here: Julia is isolated by guilt over the accidental death of her older brother, and, thus, she\u2019s vulnerable to manipulation; the psycho killer is tormented by memories of his sexually inappropriate parents; and the Good Guy is bent on atoning for his youthful cowardice. Got it?  Kramon\u2019s writing style is also pretty elementary. In the opening chapters, in particular, he generates so many flat similes that they quickly become distracting: \u201cThe air felt like a shirt just out of the dryer\u201d; \u201call the excitement just drained out, like water from a tub\u201d; \u201cthe light in the woods was thin and clear, like light in an aquarium.\u201d But, as the story gets going, this stylistic tic becomes less pronounced \u2014 or maybe it just seems petty to focus on simile pile-ups when poor Julia is breathless with terror. Things start out pleasantly enough. In her first semester, Julia finds herself in the unusual \u2014 and not altogether comfortable \u2014 position of being regarded as an object of desire by three different men. Marcus, a nice enough guy in her music class who has the disconcerting habit of smiling too much, \u00e0 la Jack Nicholson, asks her out for lunch. Their date irks Sam, a cute older guy who works at the campus snack bar. Sam has been trying to woo Julia by slipping extra pickles onto her sandwich plate. He, too, seems amiable, although it\u2019s odd that he hangs around campus and tries to pass for a much younger man. Drew, the boyfriend of Julia\u2019s roommate, is so attentive to her that it\u2019s downright repulsive: Julia\u2019s internal alarms go on red alert the evening she finds him rooting around in her bureau. Sam quickly wins this first round of the dating game, and yet Julia has misgivings. Why does he stare at her so blankly during intimate moments? Why is his apartment so bare, and what\u2019s in that strange box she once spotted? Marcus, meanwhile, tries his devious best to sabotage Julia\u2019s new relationship with Sam. Is Marcus irrationally jealous? Kramon\u2019s omniscient narrator peers into the minds of principal characters, and since all of them have something to hide, their thoughts sound incriminating. Standard creepy events escalate: footsteps that trail Julia on a lonely path, a familiar cat that turns up mutilated in her dorm room. (Where is security at this school?) Kramon pulls his climax \u2014 featuring an isolated cabin and a blinding blizzard \u2014 straight out of the Christie playbook, although it must be noted that Dame Agatha never permitted knife-wielding predators entrance into her fiction. \u201cThe Preservationist\u201d is superficial and schematic, but the final plot twist lifts it into the Gentleman\u2019s \u201cC\u201d range.

This time, well-known authors have been employed to hustle her characters into the 21st century. The Janeites, as her followers are known, may well chain themselves to the publishing house door, but perhaps Jane is smiling from her corner of heaven\u2019s drawing room. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Joanna Trollope, the author of many wonderfully readable novels focusing on the ups and downs of British middle-class lives, drew the \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d card, and has produced the debut volume in this new series. (Curtis Sittenfeld\n will bring \u201cPride & Prejudice\u201d into the present in fall 2014, and Alexander McCall Smith is at work on \u201cEmma.\u201d) Trollope sticks closely to the \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d plot: Austen\u2019s horse-drawn coaches become Aston Martins, uncle Sir John Middleton runs an outdoor clothing company that sounds a lot like L.L. Bean, and Marianne sends passionate notes to her heartless lover via e-mail. Like Austen\u2019s Elinor (\u201csense\u201d), this modern Elinor\n\n\n\n is still a responsible older sister, who carefully hides her love for the do-good Edward Ferrars. Meanwhile, Marianne (\u201csensibility\u201d) falls for a caddish John Willoughby \u2014 just like the originals. But there comes a moment, hard to pin down, when Trollope\u2019s characters leave their predecessors behind and become players in their own lives. Even though you may know Austen\u2019s novels well enough to predict exactly what will happen next, you\u2019ll care about finding your way to the happy ending of Trollope\u2019s version. If we allow the basic question \u2014 should this happen at all? \u2014 the next question is simple: Is the new \u201cS&S\u201d worth reading? The answer is unequivocally yes. Trollope \u2014 a descendant of the prolific Victorian writer Anthony Trollope \u2014 has immersed herself in Austen\u2019s novels, finding at the core of each three drivers: \u201cromantic love, money and class.\u201d She manages to make her characters contemporary without letting them drift from these fundamental concerns. Elinor really does worry about money and is glad to have a job; Marianne certainly becomes enmeshed in romantic love no matter how unworthy her choice; and belonging to a particular class is as fueled by birth and finance in 2013 as it was in 1811.\n The Austen Project is a breathtaking tribute to Jane Austen. Profit-driven 21st-century publishers have faith in her iconic name and immaculate plots.

But the family tree is also a deeply disturbing document, as close study of it reveals that all the members of one branch of the family, whatever the years of their birth, died between 1941 and 1944. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The explanation is plain: Living in Eastern Europe as war came to Poland and then to Russia, they were swept away by the Holocaust. Unlike other members of the family who had made their escape, the children and grandchild of Shalom Tvi and his wife, Beyle, stayed in their ancestral world and were put to death there. As Laskin says: \u201cThe three branches of my mother\u2019s family endured and enacted the great Jewish upheavals of the twentieth century \u2014 mass immigration to the United States, the founding of Israel, and the Shoah. My grandfather and his first cousins fought in two world wars, ran two successful businesses, copied Torah scrolls, planted citrus groves in Palestine, lived in a mansion by the sea on Long Island, and watched tanks draped in swastikas grind through the boulevards of Vilna. One family \u2014 three fates. . . . History made and broke my family in the twentieth century.\u201d\n The story begins in the late 19th century in \u201cthe Pale of Settlement where the tzars had decreed that their Jews must live\u201d \u2014 \u201cnearly a thousand miles along the western fringe of the Russian Empire\u201d \u2014 and ends in the early 21st century in Israel, where Laskin went to discuss matters of family history with the three children of Chaim and Sonia Kaganovich, cousins who had gone from Poland to Palestine in the 1920s, married each other, raised a family and became witnesses to, and participants in, \u201cthe tragedy of modern Palestine . . . that one oppressed, thwarted people had come to settle among, and inevitably to displace, another oppressed, thwarted people.\u201d \n For its first hundred or so pages, \u201cThe Family\u201d is a story of Americanization, in particular the children of Avram and Gishe Kaganovich (who changed their names to Abraham and Sarah Cohen) and their children, especially their daughter Itel. Born in 1886, she grew into a woman of \u201cwill, daring, and absolute authority\u201d who married William Rosenthal in 1906 in Hoboken, N.J., and with him as partner set off on an extraordinary career. She was an uncommonly gifted seamstress whose talents were discovered by an Englishwoman named Enid Bissett, \u201cthe proprietress of a dress concession called Enid Frocks.\u201d They joined forces and soon took the business in a startling new direction. Rebelling against the prevailing fashion for dresses that made women look flat-chested, they devised an undergarment that Enid called \u201cMaiden Form.\u201d \n   \u201cThe Maiden Form bra was the quintessence of the 1920s,\u201d Laskin writes, \u201cfun, novel, vaguely risqu\u00e9, easy to mass produce, perfectly promotable, seemingly frivolous but in fact eminently practical and instantly indispensable. No one had heard of a brassiere in 1920. By 1924, all the fashionable women had to have one.\u201d Soon enough Itel and her partners got out of dressmaking, turned their full labors to Maiden Form (it was later made into a single word) and made fortunes for themselves. Itel, the radical anti-czarist from Eastern Europe, \u201cturned out to be [a] genius at branding.\u201d She may have been \u201ca short, stout, chain-smoking immigrant with an accent,\u201d but by the 1930s she had become \u201ca captain of industry.\u201d As Laskin says: \u201cOnly in America.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Itel\u2019s brothers did well, too, though not as spectacularly as she. They set up a company called A. Cohen & Sons, rented a building on East Broadway and set about establishing themselves. By 1925 they had incorporated, moved \u201cto the relatively swank environs of 584-586 Broadway\u201d and put themselves \u201crespectably on the map in every sense.\u201d Over the years their fortunes waxed and waned \u2014 the Depression was far harder on them than on Maiden Form, the market for brassieres by then having proved Depression-proof \u2014 but they secured places for themselves in the middle and upper-middle classes, where their descendants are to be found to this day. \n Life was more of a challenge and its rewards less glittering for Chaim and Sonia in Palestine, but they proved ready for the hard life of farmers in \u201ca new cooperative farming village \u2014 a moshav \u2014\u00a0\u201d called Kfar Vitkin. Tensions between the Jewish settlers and their Arab neighbors ran high at times, but the Kaganoviches managed to improve the \u201ctiny, spartan house\u201d that Chaim had built with cinder blocks and to bring up their children, born between 1936 and 1951, in a reasonably peaceful atmosphere. In 1959, though, Chaim \u201csuffered a serious stroke\u201d that left him \u201ca \u2018broken man,\u2019\u2009\u201d in the words of his son Benny. By then Sonia\u2019s father, Shalom Tvi, was living with them in circumstances made uncomfortable by Chaim\u2019s anger at his misfortune. \n The greatest misfortune, though, was inflicted upon those who remained in Europe. Polish anti-Semitism had begun to intensify during the 1920s and was a crucial consideration in the departure from the homeland of Abraham Cohen\u2019s family as well as Chaim and Sonia, but by the late 1930s, \u201cVilna\u2019s Jewish residents and refugees had little hope of securing sanctuary in the United States or anywhere else in the world. The ranks of those who succeeded were tiny: according to one report, as of April 1940, a total of 137 Vilna Jews had immigrated to all countries excluding Palestine; of these, 41 were admitted to the United States.\u201d Doba, a granddaughter of Shalom Tvi, may have been \u201ctenderhearted,\u201d but she was furious: \u201cIt made her crazy to see others heedlessly enjoying what she and her children lacked. No one she knew enjoyed more than the American relatives. They became the focus of her fury. She blamed them for being rich while she and her family were poor, for being comfortable while they were suffering, for not doing more to help them.\u201d \n   In 1941, \u201cthe Nazis entered Vilna on June 24, Volozhin on June 25, and Rakov on June 26.\u201d The places where those descendants of Shimon Dov Hakohen and Beyle Shapiro who had not managed to flee still lived were now under Nazi control, and the carnage soon began. Vilna, \u201cwith its combustible mix of cultured Jews, anti-Semitic Lithuanians, and stateless Poles, became a kind of laboratory for Nazi terror and mass murder.\u201d It was \u201cthe first place where the Nazis began to murder Jews on a methodical, industrial scale. . . . Of the eighty thousand Jews living in Vilna when the Germans seized the city in June 1941, only two to three thousand survived the war.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Seventeen members of this family died; little is known about their exact fates, but \u201conly two likely died in a gas chamber.\u201d The rest? \u201cThe others were shot over pits, lined up and machine-gunned, murdered by gentile neighbors, burned alive, worked almost to death, and then shot and incinerated.\u201d \n The story is no easier to read when told in Laskin\u2019s understated prose than it is in the countless other documents we have about the Holocaust. But no matter how many times the tale is told, it demands to be read. Told as it is in the history of this one family, it becomes a metaphor of sorts for the 20th century, one in which incredible good fortune was granted to some and incomprehensible agony to others. As Laskin writes at the end: \u201cThe pulse of history beats in every family. All our lives are engraved with epics of love and death. What my family gained and lost in the twentieth century, though extreme, was not unique. War has touched all of us. Fate and chance and character make and break every generation. The Shoah was not the only genocide. America is not the first land of opportunity nor will it be the last. Warring peoples have fought over the Holy Land for thousands of years, all of them claiming to have God on their side. . . . Open the book of your family and you will be amazed, as I was, at what you find.\u201d All of which is true, but the book of this particular family stands out for the extremes of joy and sorrow contained within it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n THE FAMILY \n\n \n\n Three Journeys Into the Heart of the Twentieth Century \n\n By David Laskin Viking. 383 pp. $32", "topics": ["entertainment", "books"], "author": "Jonathan Yardley", "wordCount": 1454}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In Brittany, lighthouses, oysters, ancient stones \u2014 and the end of the world", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/3329ef44/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cin0Ebrittany0Elighthouses0Eoysters0Eancient0Estones0E0Eand0Ethe0Eend0Eof0Ethe0Eworld0C20A130C10A0C310C325cd5dc0E3cca0E11e30Eb7ba0E50A3fb5822c3e0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "Do you know where the world ends? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t According to the French, it ends somewhere near Ruscumunoc, a little fishing village in Brittany. Just follow the road up the hill, the locals tell me, then straight, then to the left. As I drive up the narrow potholed road that deteriorates more and more with every passing minute, the radio that has been blasting Breton Celtic music goes completely quiet. After a mile or so, the road suddenly ends. I park my small European rental car and walk up an overgrown path to the crest of a hill. There the ground suddenly drops in a dramatic cliff toward the Atlantic Ocean, and France is no more. A sign points to the west: New York 5080 km, it says; 3,156 miles. To my left, at the base of the cliff, is a small sandy beach. It\u2019s so postcard-pretty that I scramble down for a short suntanning break at the \u201cend of the world.\u201d There\u2019s no one in sight. \n\n Details: Brittany \n\n I\u2019ve wanted to go to the westernmost French department of Finist\u00e8re (from the Latin \u201cfinis terrae,\u201d or the end of the earth) since the day I first heard about it a few years ago. I wanted to see this edge of Brittany , the land that time forgot, and take a break from the rush of modern life. I wanted to see the wild, empty beaches, the tiny roads and tiny villages. But what lured me most to Finist\u00e8re and to Brittany were the lighthouses, promising remote beauty, relaxing solitude \u2014 and sweeping views, of course. There are 148 lighthouses in Brittany, one of them so old that it dates back to the time of Louis XIV. Some are perched on rocky islets lashed by waves; others sit safely on the coast, looking toward the ocean. Once, their lights guided sailors to safety. Today, 80 are still working, but many others are just majestic ghosts of the past. To get a good view of Brittany\u2019s stunning coast, I decide to climb to the top of the 19th-century Eckm\u00fchl lighthouse (named for a Napoleonic general), one of the tallest in the world. After walking up its 307 steps, my muscles are sore and my legs rubbery, but I emerge into the vast panorama of the Atlantic, the wind bringing up the smell of salt and algae and wet sand. The village of Penmarc\u2019h spreads out below, with its small white houses set against green pastures. If the name Penmarc\u2019h doesn\u2019t sound very French to you, that\u2019s because it isn\u2019t. The word means \u201chead of a horse\u201d in the local Breton, a Celtic language brought to this region in the Middle Ages by Britons migrating to the continent. (The name comes from a local legend about a king whose head was turned into that of a horse.) The lighthouse of Saint-Mathieu, a classic white-and-red tower, is easier on my knees: It\u2019s only 163 steps up. The semi-modern lighthouse, built in 1835, is part of a crumbling 16th\u00ad\u00ad-century abbey, picturesquely set at the edge of the ocean and built on the site of an even older, 6th-century monastery. This happens everywhere in France: Wherever you go, there seem to be layers and layers of history stacked one on top of the other. In Saint-Mathieu, as far back as the 1250s, local monks would light fires to guide mariners through the dangerous waters of the channel that separates nearby islands from Brittany. Today, Saint-Mathieu is a calm, quiet place, yet its history is far from peaceful. Taking a short walk along the coast, I stumble upon an unexpected reminder of Brittany\u2019s turbulent past. Hidden in a lush carpet of wild grasses are German bunkers: stern concrete installations built during World War II to guard the coast against the Allies during the German occupation of France.   This area, now so serene, was once the site of raging battles, including the Battle of Brest, which lasted from August through September 1944 and was one of the most violent of the war. It may not have the famed D-Day sites of Normandy, but I find exploring the war mementos of Brittany even more compelling. Here, I can sit in a bunker on the edge of the ocean all by myself and reflect on the past with no crowds of tourists to interrupt my thoughts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t For me, though, there\u2019s nothing better in Brittany than walking. Countless trails run along the cliffs, starting at lighthouses or leading to them, and though I have a few favorites, it\u2019s hard to decide which is the most spectacular. Would it be the path in C\u00f4te Sauvage (the Wild Coast) with its tall grasses rolling in the wind, as if mimicking the ocean, and with its numerous sandy beaches tucked between the peach- \u00adcolored cliffs? Or would it be the one around Cap du Raz, where sharp rocks run far into the sea and vast fields of gorse flowers smell of vanilla? Or maybe the one along the pink cliffs of Cap Fr\u00e9hel that surround its sturdy modern lighthouse, where I have a picnic lunch (farm-fresh strawberries, a crunchy baguette and a piece of a delicate local goat cheese called Le M\u00e9nez Hom) and watch as seagulls circle above the waves? If I could, I\u2019d hike all these trails in every season, every year. Next time I come, though, I\u2019ll add another lighthouse experience to my travels at the end of the world \u2014 and for that I\u2019ll head to Riantec. There, in a whitewashed village on the edge of the white-capped sea, stands a slim white lighthouse, about 82 feet high, with a modern kitchen and a bathroom. It\u2019s available for rent, along with a guesthouse in the former keeper\u2019s house. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll stay, pretending that I\u2019m a lighthouse keeper of the past. \n Gourmet attractions \n The beauty of Brittany\u2019s coast kept my index finger glued to the shutter button of my camera, but this far corner of France was pleasing to more than my sense of sight. The region also has a lot to offer a traveling gourmand: buttery cookies and eggy puddings, mussels in white wine \u2014 and classic buckwheat flour pancakes. The local galettes (savory pancakes created in Brittany in the 16th century) are so delicious that I had them for breakfast, lunch and dinner day after day: pancakes with Camembert cheese in applesauce, pancakes with smoked salmon and sour cream, pancakes with scallops baked in whiskey. After several days of a pancake-based diet, though, I was ready for another Breton delicacy: oysters. For that, I headed toward Saint-Philibert, one of the villages on Brittany\u2019s picturesque oyster route. I was going to sample oysters straight from the water, from a gold-medal-winning producer. Renan Henry\u2019s oyster farm is one of many dotting the shore of the peaceful bay of Quiberon, but it\u2019s also one of the best. Instead of a sign to assure me that I\u2019ve arrived at \u201cHuitres Henry,\u201d there\u2019s a several-foot-high pile of mussel shells in the front yard, a sure giveaway that oysters are being raised nearby. (Oysters grow attached to mussel shells, which are later discarded.)   Monsieur Henry welcomes me with a smile, apologizing for the chaos in his award-winning oisteculture: There\u2019s just always so much work around oysters, he tells me. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Several employees clad in yellow overalls rush around the muddy shore, washing the oysters and dragging cases full of ready product. The farm has been in Henry\u2019s family for five generations, and now it\u2019s in his and his brother\u2019s hands. He shows me around. He points at crates submerged in the ocean where the mollusks are \u201cself-cleaning,\u201d then teaches me how to judge the quality of an oyster by checking the cleanliness of its interior, the regularity of its shape and the evenness of its color. Then it\u2019s time to try the oysters. I slurp one, then another. They taste of salt, of citrus fruits, of sea. \n Stone ages \n As I drive from Monsieur Henry\u2019s farm to the town of Carnac, where I\u2019ve booked a bed-and-breakfast for the night, I suddenly notice something that makes me bring the car screeching to a halt: menhirs, standing silent in the middle of a forest. In the dim light of the moon, the huge ancient stones resemble small extinguished lighthouses scattered among the trees, sentinels from Brittany\u2019s mysterious Celtic past. Or even pre-Celtic, as some of the local stones are believed to be 6,500 years old \u2014 much older than those in Stonehenge. Local Breton legend claims that the menhirs were brought here by goblins or fairies, or even by the devil himself. On Christmas night, the stones are supposed to come alive and run toward nearby streams to drink, crushing anyone unlucky enough to find themselves in their path. Since I don\u2019t believe in goblins or fairies, I visit Carnac\u2019s museums to look for a less supernatural explanation for the prehistoric stones\u2019 placement. But to my disappointment, a straightforward answer doesn\u2019t seem to exist. Archaeologists don\u2019t really know for sure why the menhirs were erected here. Some researchers say that the stones were part of a cult of the dead; others that they were used for astronomical purposes or for fertility rites. What seems certain, though, is that the area around Carnac has one of the highest concentrations of megaliths in the world: more than 3,000 of them. What\u2019s most magical about Carnac\u2019s erected stones isn\u2019t their sheer multitude, though \u2014 it\u2019s the way I stumble upon them everywhere, unexpectedly. As I take a path through one of the local forests, I suddenly come across circles of prehistoric stones, tall, lonely menhirs and moss-covered dolmens. The way they take me by surprise, with my 21st-century phone in one hand and my digital camera in the other, makes me feel connected to the very distant past of this place, to its people and its legends. The next day, I buy a box of oysters at a local farmers market (less than $10 for 18) and in the evening come to watch the moon rise above the ancient alignments. I sit on one of the fallen menhirs (no archaeologists here to slap my wrists), savor the oysters and wonder who put so much effort into dragging these enormous stones here and pushing them upright. And why. The bells of a medieval church in a nearby village chime the passage of time. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful. Brittany may not be the end of the world, but sometimes it feels as if it were. In a good way. \n Zaraska is a Canadian science and travel writer currently based in France.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Marta Zaraska", "wordCount": 1744}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "North Carolina waterfalls will plunge you headlong into a reverie", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/332a24d0/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cnorth0Ecarolina0Ewaterfalls0Ewill0Eplunge0Eyou0Eheadlong0Einto0Ea0Ereverie0C20A130C10A0C310C3ec87b9c0E3db40E11e30Eb7ba0E50A3fb5822c3e0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "As waterfalls go, Bridal Veil Falls are fairly small and easy to find. They cascade above Highway 64 just a couple of miles north of the town of Highlands in the Great Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The fun fact about Bridal Veil Falls is that, if your car is small enough, you can drive under the 120-foot \u201cveil\u201d of water. Our 10-year old Mini Cooper, whose name is D.B. \u2014 get it? D.B. Cooper? \u2014 easily fits into the wedge between water and mountain and made for a neat photo op. But if you drive, say, a big extended-cab pickup truck, the maneuver could get tricky.  My husband, Roy, and I have come to Cashiers, a lovely village just a few miles from Highlands, for a late-summer sojourn. Both of us like to hike and to photograph waterfalls, and these ancient, mythical Appalachian Mountains and tapestries of forests are striated with dozens and dozens of them within just a few miles\u2019 radius of Cashiers. \n\n Details: Cashiers, N.C. \n\n We were staying at the High Hampton Inn, which is just a mile from town and right smack in the middle of waterfall country. The inn, at a cool and comfortable elevation of 3,600 feet, is a welcome respite from the heat and humidity of our home in Georgia. The High Hampton is reminiscent of those fabulous family resorts of the Catskills, sort of like the one in the movie \u201cDirty Dancing.\u201d But hubby and I have been married way too long for dirty dancing of any sort, so we spend our time chasing waterfalls instead. Armed with a map provided by the High Hampton \u2014 waterfall-viewing is a frequent request of the inn\u2019s guests, so a list of those nearby is graciously provided \u2014 we struck out north, south, east and west in search of these liquid treasures. First we went south to Silver Run Falls, just under three miles from the inn. Silver Run is considered small, at a drop of only 30 to 40 feet, and the hike into the deep woods is easy on a trail surrounded by cathedrals of mountain laurel and rhododendron. Beneath a sky brindled with silver-edged clouds and iridescent sunlight, it was pretty here, and no one else was around in the early morning. The moment was romantic, and we quickly stole a clandestine kiss. Good thing, too. Our next stop was Sliding Rock Falls, where the late summer warmth brought out lots of kids and more than a few pups to frolic on the smooth rocks carved to softness by endless water. The bottom of the falls forms a big swimming hole, the old-fashioned country kind that\u2019s the perfect antidote to a hot day. There would be no stolen kisses here. At Whitewater Falls, which was our next stop and, depending on whom you ask, is in either North or South Carolina, the roar was impressive, and I was mesmerized by the unharnessed power created by not much more than the simplest elements of time, water, rock, erosion and gravity. The beauty and power of waterfalls never ceases to amaze me. The thing about Whitewater Falls, at 411 feet the highest in the eastern United States, is that you hear them long before you see them. As you glide along the footpath, the anticipation of seeing the falls grows, and the ground practically hums with unseen energy. An amalgam of fresh scents of rushing water and verdant forests fills the air. There are a thousand hues of green in these hemlock forests that I never imagined existed and that can\u2019t possibly be found in any artist\u2019s palette.   Then, like an apparition, Whitewater Falls finally come into view, the mist rising against the mountains so that they\u2019re veiled in a ghostly haze, the massive rocks polished golden in the soft sunlight. As my camera clicked away, I knew in my heart that there\u2019s no way to fully capture the falls\u2019 splendor in photos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t That afternoon, we traveled a few miles east of Cashiers along Highway 64 to Gorges State Park, near Sapphire, in Transylvania County. The park has access to several falls, including Drift Falls, Turtleback Falls, Bearwallow Falls, Horse Pasture Falls and Rainbow Falls. \u201cIf it\u2019s sunny, you can see a rainbow at Rainbow Falls,\u201d a park ranger explained as he gave us a map of the park. \u201cIt\u2019s just spectacular, but you have to come in the morning when the light is right.\u201d By then, it was early afternoon, so we chose instead to take an easier hike to the amusingly named Bearwallow Falls. As we descended along the pathway, my mind visualized bears wallowing around in the shallow parts of the water. The trail is steep, a little slippery, and scribbled with bright yellow, daisylike flowers. For someone like me who\u2019s, um, a little overweight and out of shape, it wasn\u2019t long before I was out of breath trying to keep up with my better half. If there were bears wallowing around, self-preservation be darned. Though I didn\u2019t want to become a nice, plump ursine entree, I was sure that I couldn\u2019t run on those precipitous paths. No bears put me to the test that day, but I have to say that the view of the falls was bear-y pretty. Our next sojourn took us west on Highway 64 to Highlands, where we found Bridal Veil Falls and Dry Falls. The latter supposedly got their name because you can walk on a stone path behind the falls and not get wet. Roy accepted the challenge and took a few steps under the falls before coming quickly back. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call these falls exactly dry,\u201d he shivered. \u201cThere\u2019s a cold spray under there.\u201d The next morning, fueled by the High Hampton Inn\u2019s immense buffet breakfast, we steered D.B. north of Cashiers on Highway 107 toward Glenville. Here, Hurricane Falls spill serenely into the sapphire waters of Lake Glenville, a long finger of water surrounded by the rolling Smokies. As we drove along the scenic highway that edges the lake, I thought of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cGreen Hills of Africa.\u201d The landscape of the green hills of the Appalachians is completely different from that of East Africa, certainly, but sometimes inspiration and creativity arise solely from the beauty of a place. In a way, waterfalls, hypnotic and tantalizing, have the unique ability to send one into a contemplative mood. It just seems easy to pull up a rock and sit a spell and ponder the meaning of life. Somehow these cold, sweet falling waters provide answers to life\u2019s conundrums in a peaceful and harmonious way. \n Anderson is a freelance writer in Hazlehurst, Ga.

In the village of Banon, the only way to go is up, toward a castle built by Simiane, Lord of Banon, back in the 12th century. Simiane\u2019s family kept it running until the French Revolution, when the last owner, Alexandre Tournon-Simiane, was run out of town and the castle was burned. The steep, newly paved road quickly turned to cobblestones as it wound past tiny hobbit-size doorways in the lower village, then through a strange stone portal marking the castle entrance. Above us were openings in the castle walls that defenders used to drop rocks and hot oil on invaders. We rested twice before reaching the old church at the summit. The ancient wooden door opened not to rows of wooden pews or religious images, but to an exhibition of contemporary paintings. We\u2019d stumbled upon one of the secret spots of Banon. \n\n Details: Banon \n\n To many visitors, Provence has become synonymous with thousands of English and German tourists jamming narrow, winding roads with tour buses and camper vans. The idyllic village depicted two decades ago in Peter Mayle\u2019s \u201c A Year in Provence \u201d has become harder to find. But there\u2019s still some of the old Provence out there, a place that\u2019s more rugged but still has the sharp light and the breathtaking vistas that have drawn visitors to the south of France for generations. Haute-Provence, or upper Provence, as this area is called, is a bit more like the hardscrabble landscape of Wild and Wonderful West Virginia than the pastoral Virginia Blue Ridge. It\u2019s more isolated and less affluent, but becoming a haven for some French artists and intellectuals looking for the next unspoiled place where they can find inspiration and enjoy a slower lifestyle. \n On the road to Banon \n We found this rugged rural spirit of Provence in Banon, a town of 1,000 people about two hours\u2019 drive east of Avignon. Banon is tiny, but known to the outside world (i.e., Paris) for two things: its chestnut-wrapped, brandy-soaked cheese and a four-story bookstore called Le Bleuet, tucked into a 15th-century stone building. After years of expansion, including to a warehouse just outside town, it now boasts more titles (190,000) than any bookstore in France except for one in Lille. \u201cI live in a privileged place,\u201d says Joel Gattefosse, a Parisian who moved to Banon in 1990 to open Le Bleuet. \u201cEven in August, it\u2019s calm. We have the sun, the light, the forest for walking.\u201d There are no hotels in Banon, just a few guesthouses. Like most summer visitors, we found our lodgings through a determined Web search, followed by e-mails and a phone call to the owner of a small apartment at La Bastide des Muriers. The renovated 17th- \u00adcentury stone farmhouse sits at the base of Banon, about a half-mile from the town center. The photos on the Web site looked pretty good, so we crossed our fingers.   My wife and I were looking for a place to see the French countryside after a week of tromping about the sidewalks, cafes and museums of Paris with our 7-year-old son, Diego. Rather than take the fast but expensive TGV train from Paris to Avignon, we decided to economize and rent a car for the entire nine-day trip. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Delays at the car agency in Paris pushed our departure to noon on a Friday, not a great time to be negotiating the city\u2019s famed peripherique, or beltway, along with thousands of other Parisians headed out of town for the weekend. We followed the Autoroute du Sud, a six-lane highway that winds down the heart of France through Burgundy, Lyon and the Rhone Valley.  Despite my best efforts to keep up with the southbound traffic, we didn\u2019t reach our overnight stop just north of Avignon until 9:30 p.m. To make matters worse, the hotel manager had misread the Internet booking and had reserved our room for the following night. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just wrote it down wrong,\u201d he told us. All his rooms were booked for the night. We were hungry, tired and confused, and even my best French wasn\u2019t going to help us out of this jam. So we decided to place ourselves at his mercy. A few phone calls later, the owner had found us a room \u2014 for the same rate \u2014 at Le Moulin de la Roque, a nearby country lodge set in an olive grove. The next morning, our breakfast of fresh croissants, cafe au lait and sweet apricots made us feel as if we\u2019d finally started our vacation. And there was an unexpected bonus. It turned out that our lodge was only at few miles from Chateauneuf du Pape, a small village where Pope John XXII had established his own vineyard when the papacy was moved from Rome to Avignon in the 14th century. Today, the village of Chateanneuf du Pape is surrounded by France\u2019s top-quality Rhone Valley wine district of the same name. Its lush reds are characterized by powerful raspberry, violet and lavender flavors that come from a blend of up to 13 different varieties of grapes. Sampling these wines was on my mind as we pulled up to a little knoll where the ruins of the pope\u2019s old castle overlook the Rhone. The stone archways and crumbling walls made a great playground. Diego and I fired imaginary arrows through openings in the thick stone walls. We headed down the ancient steps from the castle to the town below as buses disgorged visitors in search of the same magical red wine. We stumbled into a cool tasting room built into the hillside over an old Roman wine cave. After a few tastes of Chateauneuf du Pape, I imagined myself living like, well, a pope with his own vineyard in southern France. \n Up the mountain \n In the afternoon, my wife took the wheel of our Renault Clio as we headed east from the rolling vineyards to a massive mountain on the horizon \u2014 Le Mont Ventoux. The two-hour drive took us through more farmland, fruit orchards and agricultural towns. We stopped at a bicycle shop in Sault, a village perched at 2,500 feet. Sault is a launching pad for cyclists of all abilities to make the 15-mile climb to the summit of Ventoux, the last few miles along a barren moonscape of white rocks that provide no shelter from often howling winds. I rode up Mont Ventoux with some friends in 2002 and then watched cyclist Lance Armstrong close the gap and nearly beat a French rider during the Tour de France. This year, a Kenyan rider for a British team crushed all his rivals on his way to winning the three-week race.   With three bikes strapped to our car, we pushed ahead on the 45-minute drive to Banon, winding through industrial-size lavender fields and down through the cedar forest into the town, arriving at La Bastide des Muriers just in time for a late-afternoon swim. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Diego was the first one in the water and quickly became friends with children from two French families through his expert use of cannonballs and an inflatable beach ball. Our room was small but had views of the rugged mountains above Banon and alternating patterns of gold and purple fields of wheat and lavender. \n Fun and food \n We spent the next week exploring Banon and the nearby towns of Haute-Provence. We canoed down the icy Sorgue river, which springs from an underground source at Fontaine-de-Vaucluse; hiked through formations of red ochre at the old Colorado de Rustrel quarry; and stumbled across a group of field workers harvesting lavender in the town next door. Along the way, our daily ritual was simple: scavenge the countryside for the best ingredients to accompany Banon\u2019s creamy goat-milk cheese. Sometimes we had it with tomato salad and bread, other times with local sausages made with bits of pine nuts or walnuts, or as an hors d\u2019oeuvre before dinner. Everyone we met had their own favorite food pairing. \u201cThe best way to eat it is with a fresh potato,\u201d counseled the proprietor of Super Banon, a small grocery in town with an impressive lineup of Banon cheese. He explained that each of the three-inch rounds of unpasteurized goat\u2019s milk are wrapped in bronze chestnut leaves and then aged in eau de vie, or fruit brandy. The result is a nutty, earthy flavor that\u2019s hard to find even in artisanal U.S. cheeses. In the evenings, we found plenty of dining choices in Banon. The simple pizzeria La Braserade served great lasagna with outdoor seating at the town fountain. The wine bistro Les Vins du Vert served tastings of local charcuterie served on small slate plates. One night, we nibbled on ham with white truffle, country pate on toast, zucchini souffl\u00e9 in a small Mason jar, olives and cheeses, all accompanied by a red blend from nearby Baux de Provence. Of course, all this cheese-eating and wine-drinking required at least an effort to exercise. Splashing around the pool didn\u2019t really count. So I set out for a bike ride early one morning with Jean-Pierre, another guest at Les Muriers who had come down from Dijon with his wife and their three teenage children for a two-week stay. Jean-Pierre had already ridden his bike up Mont Ventoux earlier that week, so we decided to attempt the nearby ski station at Montagne de Lure. We set out on a grueling 3,000-foot climb at an average gradient of 7 percent for 2\u200a 1 / \n 2 hours. At the summit, we were rewarded with a fantastic view of the Proven\u00e7al Alps and a few wayward mountain sheep. We celebrated with a few snapshots before the hairy descent back into the starting town of St. Etienne-les-Orgues. The race to the bottom \u2014 our reward \u2014 took only about 25 minutes. By the end, our hands ached from gripping the brake levers. When we reached the tiny town, I passed a donkey pulling a farmer sitting on a wooden cart. On the ride home to Banon, Jean-Pierre and I gazed at the forests of scrub pine and lavender growing along the roadside. \u201cThe air here is different,\u201d said Jean-Pierre. \u201cThat\u2019s why we come here. It\u2019s a bit wilder than the rest of France.\u201d My thoughts exactly. \n Niiler is a freelance writer in Chevy Chase.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Eric Niiler", "wordCount": 1768}, {"date": "2013-10-31 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "This week\u2019s best travel bargains", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/332a24d5/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cthis0Eweeks0Ebest0Etravel0Ebargains0C20A130C10A0C310C9f4cd6440E40Ace0E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "What\u2019s the Deal? \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t This week\u2019s best travel bargains around the globe. \n Land \n \u25cf Pay for two nights at any Universal Orlando Resort partner hotel and receive a free third night .

The tour continued, much of it aimed at pointing out the place\u2019s enviro-friendly bent: aerated concrete floors, radiant heat from a geothermal system, limestone walls that resist mold, renewable or recovered-wood furniture custom-made with low-VOC glues and paints. I started to glaze over at the fast-paced chatter and came back into focus midway through his spiel about the bed. Organic, ergonomic, blah, blah, blah, blah, but then he added, \u201cBe careful: Don\u2019t lie on it until you\u2019re ready to go to sleep. It\u2019s the most comfortable bed ever.\u201d That got my attention, so I heeded his warning \u2014 and adjusted my evening plans to include an early turn-in. Before dinner, I wanted to get out and walk around the Fells Point neighborhood, but it was pretty hard to leave the room. With its clean lines and terra cotta, beige and green color scheme, it had a Southwest vibe about it, or perhaps I should make that a southwestern Greece vibe (since the family that owns the inn is Greek). All the art on the walls is by local artists \u2014 for sale, of course. A little rowing machine is tucked into one corner. And accessible from both the large bedroom and the living room is a balcony, big enough for a table and a couple of chairs. The long-range view from that balcony, of downtown Baltimore and the Inner Harbor, is better than the short-range, of the vacant lot surrounded by a chain-link fence across the street. But as the sun set, it was enough to finally pull me outdoors, on a stroll that quickly led to the cobblestone streets, bars, shops and art galleries of Fells Point. The inn has a well-regarded restaurant, the Black Olive, attached, along with a nifty little food market on the ground floor selling wine, takeout and even some produce. But I had off-site dinner plans, after which I fell into bed. (The sleep-inducing comfort of the CozyPure brand bed, by the way, was no exaggeration. That one has gone on my wish list.) So I didn\u2019t partake of any food until the morning, when I ordered \u00adroom-service breakfast that might have had the speediest delivery \u2014 all of 10 minutes \u2014 I\u2019ve ever experienced. The coffee was strong (and made from locally roasted beans, by Zeke\u2019s), but the standout was the Greek (of course) yogurt, luscious and thick, and there were a whopping two cups of it, topped with decent strawberries and with more fruit \u2014 strawberries, pineapple and kiwi \u2014 on the side. That\u2019s not all: There were walnuts, toasted and still warm. And unfiltered honey, also warm and pourable. It was simple, elegant, well-thought-out and bounteous, easily enough for two people. It cost all of $9. Did I mention how cheap the inn was, generally? The Sunday night in late September when I was there, I got a slow-day rate of $199 (although in upcoming weeks the suites start at $239). How much would that be for, say, a month? Way too much, of course. But for a quick trip to Baltimore, it felt like a sheer bargain.\u00a0 \n Details \n \n\n Inn at the Black Olive \n\n 803 South Caroline St. Baltimore 443-681-6316 \n\n www.theblackolive.com \n\n Twelve suites from $229.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Joe Yonan", "wordCount": 736}, {"date": "2013-10-31 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "What a Trip: A solo spiritual sojourn in Greece", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/3329ebd1/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cwhat0Ea0Etrip0Ea0Esolo0Espiritual0Esojourn0Ein0Egreece0C20A130C10A0C310Cb74cf1120E40Ad20E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "Our readers share tales of their rambles around the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n Who: Marcy Gouge of Gaithersburg \n\n Where, when, why: I went to Greece (and Ephesus in Turkey) as part of a month-long \u201crenewal\u201d offered by my employer, AARP. I wanted to walk in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul as he preached to the Gentile churches, and I wanted to see Santorini and other Greek isles. \n\n Highlights and high points: The views of the Parthenon from my breakfast table on the roof of the hotel and of the Temple of Zeus from my room balcony. It was like viewing a time warp to look at the sleek, modern hotel nestled beside ruins 2,000 years old. I felt as if I was in the middle of the \u201csea of time\u201d and realized that even though the exterior of the modern world is different, we are the same as the ancient Greeks. We\u2019re still searching for the answers to the most important questions: Who are we, why are we here, and is there a supreme being in charge of the world? My visit to the ruins of Ephesus, in modern-day Turkey, brought me to the area where Paul spoke to the church leaders and was a very emotional and spiritual experience for me. I saw the riches of the Greek world and knew that Paul must have been very persuasive to cause people to turn from their culture to accept Jesus as the Christ, especially when it meant the loss of wealth and possessions. The sunset in Oia, on Santorini, is famous, and it lived up to its reputation. The ancient volcano in the harbor glimmered in the twilight, and the blue-roofed white buildings on the hill were perfect in the dwindling light. \n\n Cultural connection or disconnect: Traveling alone as an older woman was interesting in a culture that\u2019s so family-oriented. Waiters saw me come into the restaurant alone and often brought me a glass of wine or a special treat to make me feel welcome. This led to many conversations with the locals, who expressed curiosity about where I was from. When I said Washington, they often talked politics with me, especially since the news about the government shutdown was everywhere. We shared good-natured laughs about governments that can\u2019t seem to get any work done! One evening, I stayed until a restaurant was ready to close and met everyone in it, sharing stories and wine. I left feeling that I had a family there. \n\n Biggest laugh or cry: I was fortunate to be in Athens to see the start of the torch relay for the Winter Olympics in Russia. As the runners came down the street with the torch held high, I unexpectedly felt tears rolling down my checks. Greece might be a small nation now, but once it was the center of the ancient world. I realized the power of the Olympic torch to rekindle that ancient pride for diverse cultures worldwide. \n\n How unexpected: I was struck by the resilience of the Greeks, who are dealing with the austerity measures imposed by the European Union. They have an inherent optimism and joy in life despite the high unemployment rate. There are no beggars or homeless people in the streets \u2014 everyone is proud to work, even at menial jobs. Family is everything, and people support each other emotionally and financially. What a lesson for those of us who cling to our material possessions as if they\u2019ll keep us warm at night or hold us close in times of trouble! \n\n Fondest memento or memory: My greatest souvenir wasn\u2019t something that I could buy, but an experience that spoke to my heart. I visited the Isle of Patmos, where the Apostle John received his Revelation from God. The grotto where he lived is 74 steps down into a tight, dark cave. Once there, I sat quietly to meditate and pray, and to listen for guidance in my life. Bright frescoes on the walls depict God speaking to John, and you can touch the very spot where tradition says the apostle laid his head to rest. I left with a renewed sense of peace and purpose.

As she tried to adjust the seat and the rear view mirror, \u201cI heard a crack,\u201d recalls Grimes, an Air Force retiree who lives in Little Elm, Tex. \u201cThere was an arch-shaped crack around the rear-view mirror. I was stunned.\u201d Sure enough, even after a representative assured her that the damage was \u201cno problem,\u201d she received a repair bill from the car rental company that covered damage and then some, including $311 for a new windshield and a $50 administrative fee. Like many travelers who think that they\u2019re out of options, Grimes turned to me for help. My first question to her was obvious: Have you asked Enterprise to review your bill? She hadn\u2019t. In the heat of a customer-service dispute, it\u2019s easy to forget the first rule of a resolution, which is simply to ask the company for help. Whether you\u2019re complaining about a noisy hotel room or a slow refund, it\u2019s human nature to either complain to someone who can\u2019t fix the problem or to keep quiet and hope that the trouble resolves itself. Grimes contacted the car rental company and reached a representative of its damage recovery unit. \u201cTo my surprise, they listened and determined that I was not at fault and are closing the case out,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were very polite and said I might receive another letter asking for payment for damages, but to ignore it. I just had to get the right person to listen to my experience with the car.\u201d An Enterprise representative said drivers should contact the company immediately when they have any concerns about their bill. \u201cOur objective is to do everything we can to quickly investigate and resolve claims,\u201d spokeswoman Laura Bryant said. \u201cThe process obviously is not perfect, but it is very detailed and comprehensive, and we thoroughly review all documentation provided by customers. Every precaution is taken to ensure that customers are not inadvertently charged for damage that did not occur during their specific rental period.\u201d Reliable statistics on the number of travelers who fail to request a resolution are difficult to come by, but a recent Aberdeen Group survey found that on average, companies resolved a customer problem on the first call 65 percent of the time. This suggests that asking for help \u2014 as opposed to just venting \u2014 is the most effective first step toward a resolution. It\u2019s often easier said than done, though. Whom to ask? That\u2019s the question Elaine Evosevic-Lozada had when she landed in Orlando recently with her family. Her brother-in-law had reserved a minivan through Hertz. \u201cWhen we went to pick it up, they didn\u2019t have any more minivans,\u201d she remembers. That resulted in something of a standoff, with an agent quizzing the family about how many passengers they needed to accommodate, and the family repeating its request for the minivan they\u2019d ordered. The solution? The Hertz agent pulled a few strings and upgraded the family to a luxury car that could accommodate eight passengers. \u201cThey gave it to us for the same price as the minivan,\u201d says Evosevic-Lozada, who works for a nonprofit organization in Pittsburgh. One thing is certain: Walking away disappointed wouldn\u2019t have helped. Just asking isn\u2019t always enough. It\u2019s how you make your request, as Teresa Wallis, who also recently vacationed in Orlando, recently discovered. Her family\u2019s flight from Branson, Mo., to Orlando was canceled, and her family had to wait a day and pay for new airline tickets to get to Disney World. She asked Disney whether she could start her vacation a day later. \u201cThey were super accommodating and updated the reservation and sent me a new confirmation e-mail,\u201d she says of Disney. But when she arrived at the Pop Century resort and tried to check in, a Disney cast member delivered some bad news: They had no reservation. Worse, the resort was sold out. Wallis asked whether there was a room available at a different hotel. \u201cAt this point, I was almost crying after the stress from the day before and having to go back home with our bags packed, going back to the airport the next day, paying a much higher price for the flight, and then getting there to have no room,\u201d Wallis says. Disney granted her second wish, too. After about 20 minutes of deliberation, it offered the family accommodations at the Grand Floridian, the resort\u2019s upscale property. Remembering to say something, but also framing your request in a polite way and being persistent, can dramatically reduce the number of mishaps on your next trip. And that applies to more than a rental car or a hotel problem. Airlines, cruise lines and vacation rental managers also usually respond favorably when a customer comes calling. Just don\u2019t forget to ask. \n E-mail Christopher Elliott at \nchris@elliott.org .", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Christopher Elliott", "wordCount": 817}, {"date": "2013-10-29 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "At long last, meet the new Salamander Resort", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32e2153c/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cat0Elong0Elast0Emeet0Ethe0Enew0Esalamander0Eresort0C20A130C10A0C240C82d2651a0E36970E11e30Eae460Ee4248e75c8ea0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "As Brian untied a knot in my shoulder, I felt the built-up tensions slowly dissolve. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Gone: the stress over the hotel losing my spa reservation. No more: displeasure over a previous guest\u2019s food moldering in the mini-fridge in my room. Goodbye: anxiety that the expense of this stay would exceed the experience.  \u201cRelax,\u201d ordered the massage therapist as he grabbed hold of my rigid arm. And so I allowed my limbs to fall limp, my toes to uncurl and my mind and wallet to succumb to the allure of Salamander Resort & Spa. \n After all this time, it\u2019s nice to finally meet you, Salamander. Since 2002, the luxury Middleburg property has suffered fitful starts and stops of development. To pass the time, we played the game of \u201cWill it or won\u2019t it?\u201d Well, it did, on Aug. 29. Over the years, a few crumbs of information dropped onto our empty plates, piquing our appetite. We knew that Fauquier County resident Sheila C. Johnson was the superbizwoman behind this venture, the fourth member in her Salamander Hotels & Resorts family. We also heard murmurs about a high-end spa, exemplary dining \u2014 and horses, since Middleburg is the Land of Their Little Ponies. With the resort finally open, we wanted to hear the real noise, not just the buzz. So in late September, I visited the property, taking advantage of every offering (spa, trail ride, bar, fitness center, room service, etc.) and every fireplace (five). Granted, the staff is still learning the trade, so I returned a month later to check up on its progress. The test: Could I fully relax in Salamander\u2019s company, or would I need to book an emergency session with Brian to survive the weekend? \n Reservation highs and lows \n Salamander left the gate in admirable form. I easily booked a Friday night stay online, reserving a 545-square-foot estate room with a king-size bed, an \u201cexperiential\u201d shower, a 40-inch TV and a balcony. As part of the Inaugural Offer (available through Dec. 5), I earned a $100 credit that I earmarked for the spa, or maybe horseback riding, or dinner and drinks \u2014 or a portion of all the above. A few days later, my cellphone started to ring. An employee left a message asking about my \u201cpreferences.\u201d I interpreted the request as an interest in my personal tastes: Fuji apples in the fruit basket, please, and Diet Coke, not Pepsi, in the mini-fridge. But no, the agent wanted to remind me to book any extracurricular activities before availability disappeared. At the spa, I knew that I wanted a facial but was unsure of which one. When I asked for advice, the voice on the phone simply dictated the description from the brochure; I read along to identical text on the Web site. I gravitated to the Purifying Facial, but he suggested the Signature Facial. Frightened by the sentence \u201cone of our trained experts closely analyzes your skin\u2019s needs,\u201d I passed on the lab-coat inspection of my pores for a less intrusive scrubbing. Plans now set, including a one-hour afternoon trail ride, I could kick back and \u2014 ring, ring, ring. Yes, spa, what\u2019s up? Oh, you can\u2019t remember when I\u2019m coming? No, not a Saturday in December; this Saturday. Oh, you\u2019ve forgotten which treatment I scheduled? The purifying facial. Yes, thank you. See you this Saturday.    On my second go-around, Salamander had cured its case of the hiccups. I reserved the 575-square-foot terrace double queen by phone, in addition to a well-being massage with Brian, a recommendation from a prior guest. I received a confirmation call the night before my appointment, plus a letter upon check-in. At 4 p.m., Brian fetched me from the relaxation room; 50 minutes later, he scraped me off the table. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t When I asked him how to maintain my current state of serenity, he told me to say this mantra: \u201cI need to go back to the Salamander and see Brian.\u201d He then repeated the word \u201cSalamander\u201d three times. \n Life on the estate \n Apologies to Salamander, but when I first drove up the half-mile lane lined with London plane trees, I thought that I\u2019d mistakenly stumbled into a housing development. The resort\u2019s subtlety tripped me up. The pale yellow stucco-and-stone estate is more horizontal than vertical, more understated than ostentatious. There are no cloud-skewering towers or egoist marquees. A tiny bronze plaque on a low stone pillar announces the destination. Lower your gaze to flick a stink bug off your skirt and you\u2019ll miss the welcome sign. The resort carries an air of inclusiveness, rare among resorts with peak-season rates cresting the $500 line. Non-guests are invited to come indoors and stay awhile (the Gold Cup\u2019s bar hours exceed Middleburg\u2019s usual bedtime). On the back lawn, near an oversize chess set, I met a Vienna couple who had stopped in for a ham-and-cheese sandwich. The husband raved about the crispy bread, and the wife grew wistful for her son to marry here, not in Connecticut, as planned. In the culinary garden, where the chefs and bartenders graze for herbs and vegetables, I bumped into Nina, a local resident who had dropped by after work to decompress. We wandered among the lettuce beds and plantings, pretending to know our agriculture. While we were debating kale vs. bitter greens, the head gardener showed up and gave us a proper tour. For our curiosity, we earned a tomato, a snap pea and a fistful of purple basil. With 340 acres of land, you can roam the grounds in a blissful bubble of solitude without a loud band of interlopers bursting it. Fashionably overgrown paths lead from the main building to the family pool, the putting green and the equestrian center. The horseback-riding excursions start at the barn and drop onto trails that run like dry streams through a forested sanctuary. On our ride, Moe and I trotted behind our guide and her horse, his hooves faintly clicking against rocks and roots. We paralleled a burbling creek and raced up short hills as if a basket of apples waited at the top. Back in the stables, my guide said, \u201cWhen we were coming back to the barn, I looked back at your face and you seemed melancholy.\u201d I was indeed sad to let Moe go. In the outdoor areas, I could enjoy a solitary dance with nature. But to jitterbug, I had only to approach the entryway to join the swing of cars, dogs, luggage, wheeled carts, antsy children and excitable wedding guests.   \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic,\u201d said a bellhop/valet/doorman, who had driven me into town in the resort\u2019s Audi SUV. \u201cThey want us to stay in one place, but it never works out that way.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t When I arrived the first time, I counted nine employees within 10 paces. At the entrance to the so-called Living Room, a woman dressed for show jumping \u2014 fitted blazer, tan jodhpurs, riding boots \u2014 stood like a mistress of ceremonies. Welcome, one and all, to the show.  At reception, a small alcove with a painting of a thundering horse on the back wall, the check-in attendant provided me with a key and a map. She then came around the counter to point out the route to my room. Thoughtful touch. \n The lay of the land \n The resort\u2019s 168 rooms are arranged on four floors, each representing a different season. (I slept in spring.) The guest rooms are as tasteful and tailored as a camelhair coat. The color palette springs from a chocolate-and-vanilla rainbow, and the equestrian thread runs through the linens and decor: a horse print in the water closet, a metal bridle sculpture above the white pedestal tub, room number signs shaped like riding helmets. Photographs of flowers perk up a corner fitted with a glass table and a couch. The signature on the artworks reads \u201cSheila Johnson.\u201d I spent a significant amount of time on the balcony, gazing at the faintly manicured landscape. I expected a family of foxes to scurry by, or a guest to mount the bike set outside the fitness center. Both would have fit the setting, but neither appeared. Looking around, I was the only Juliet on her balcony. So where were all the people? In the Living Room, roasting by the two fireplaces and lounging on furniture of varying coziness (from sit-up-straight chairs to slouchy couches). And in the library, a leather-and-lit retreat with more than 2,000 books and yet another fireplace (the resort must be expecting a serious chill this winter). And in the Gold Cup bar and lounge, a bon-vivant den with three large-screen TVs (sports, sports and sports) and a billiards table. And in the gift shop, which should be called Sheila\u2019s Closet. Among the items on display: Sheila Johnson Collection silk scarves, based on her photographs; Donna Karan\u2019s Urban Zen jewelry and vases by Haitian artists (the designer and Sheila, a philanthropist, visited the country last year); Mistral toiletries (she\u2019s a partner in the company); and, coming soon, clothing designs by Brett Johnson, her son. \u201cSometimes she\u2019ll bring stuff from home to sell,\u201d a store employee told me while I sniffed Zents scents. The boss\u2019s name comes up often; I heard a lot of Dr. Johnson this and Dr. Johnson that. For example, I learned from a well-suited staffer that the cornflower-blue paint in the main salon is the same shade found in her home and that she also uses Mistral products. More than one employee told me about her equestrian daughter and showed me her trophies and ribbons in the private dining room at Harrimans, the restaurant. And, not to get too personal, but we shared the same massage therapist.   Johnson sightings are also common \u2014 as in, chuck your gum because Sheila Johnson is heading straight for you. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t On Columbus Day weekend, a petite woman dressed in a Washington Capitals jersey and diamond studs approached my group of three. She stuck out her hand three times. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Donald Trump walking around his hotels shaking people\u2019s hands,\u201d said the female half of the North Carolina couple, who were attending a wedding at the resort. The duo told her about their experiences at her Florida resorts, and I discovered that Johnson and I both have tight muscles in our feet. I asked if she were relieved that, after a bumpy journey, Salamander was finally open. \u201cIt was a long time coming,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019re not finished.\u201d  To the casual observer, the resort appears complete. There were no unfurnished rooms, undecorated walls or unmanned positions. But under the microscope, I spotted some areas-in-progress. For example, the phone in my room didn\u2019t work (the front desk suggested that I \u201cwiggle the wire\u201d). In a voicemail message left on my cell, an employee slipped up her greeting, saying,\u201dHi, this is [name] from Nemacolin, I mean, Salamander Resort.\u201d I found a previous guest\u2019s brown apple slices in the mini-fridge. A spa attendant could not provide directions to the fitness center. For breakfast, room service delivered white toast; when I asked for wheat, the server told me that the kitchen had run out, even though it was only 9:30 in the morning. In addition, the resort added a 22 percent service charge and a $3 delivery fee to a $3 order. For that amount, at least take the jam out of the jars. To be fair, I did notice some improvements between my two visits. Leaving the first time, I had to wrestle with the front door while juggling my luggage. On the second departure, I again had to push the door unassisted, but this time a bellhop grabbed the handle from the other side. Perhaps on a third stay, someone will open and close the door to Salamander for me. \n details \n \n\n Salamander Resort & Spa \n\n 500 N.

He beams, makes a sweeping gesture with an arm and invites us to follow him through a capacious lobby and down a long hall that gives us glimpses of the youthful inn\u2019s tavern, the Gold Cup Wine Bar, and a 24-stool cooking studio set off with breakaway panels of chefs in action. In the 90 seconds or so that it takes to deposit us at the entrance to Harrimans Virginia Piedmont Grill, our temporary emcee gives us a crash course in the resort. We learn that owner Sheila Johnson (whom everyone here refers to as \u201cDoctor\u201d Johnson, in recognition of her multiple honorary degrees) maintains a residence nearby, and that the restaurant we\u2019re about to enter is named for the late ambassadors Averell and Pamela Harriman, who once called the surrounding 340 acres home.\n There\u2019s a lot of background to digest; the most amusing details concern pets. Salamander not only offers a \u201cyappy hour\u201d for dogs on Tuesday, our host reports, but horse -sitting services. At the moment, after a drive of more than an hour from Washington, all we want is a drink. My companions and I are eager to be seated, but our reservation is nowhere to be found. Several young women stare at a computer screen, scanning it repeatedly for the misplaced request, which we know we have because we confirmed it the day before. Behind the search party is a sea of empty tables, which makes me wonder why the minders are making us wait and watch while they hunt and peck instead of just letting us sit down. The hexagon-shaped dining room is enormous. Reinforcing the equestrian theme are spare black-and-white paintings of horses flanking the entrance and a single saddle on a tall pedestal in the center of the room. From our linen-draped table, practically broad enough to encompass multiple Zip codes, we spot an illuminated stable in the distance. The pastoral scene is dimmed by tinny elevator music in the background. Three of us order cocktails; after an epic wait, only two drinks materialize. The third, a server informs us, is \u201ccoming from another outlet.\u201d (Another outlet ?) When the glass is finally delivered, it turns out to be a shot of Sazerac whiskey rather than the requested Sazerac cocktail. The thirsty member of my group clarifies that he wants the New Orleans classic. \u201cCan you tell me what goes in it?\u201d asks The Server From The Other Outlet. Uh-oh. \u201cI\u2019ll take a Manhattan,\u201d my friend replies.  Both the server and the menu play up the restaurant\u2019s farm-to-table intentions. Todd Gray, the chef-owner of Equinox in Washington and the resort\u2019s culinary director, is referenced in tones nearly as reverential as those used for Dr. Johnson, whose garden, we\u2019re told, is the source of basil for the pastas and apples for the fruit plates. Dishes are divided among poetic-sounding headings. \u201cFrom the Tidewater,\u201d reads one. \u201cFrom the Foothills,\u201d entices another. A welcome from the kitchen, risotto fritters, is similar to what patrons of Equinox are offered as they peruse the menu.   Despite our awkward introduction to the restaurant, my posse is looking forward to dinner this Saturday in late September. Gray says that he\u2019s been working on the project for a decade, after all; pre-launch, he hired Chris Edwards as the chef de cuisine in charge of Salamander\u2019s wine bar and main dining room. Edwards hails from the glass-tented Restaurant at Patowmack Farm in Lovettsville, where his \u201cpantry\u201d consisted of 11 acres of farmland, and his very good cooking was informed by his time at the late and revered Maestro in Tysons Corner and El Bulli in Spain. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Unfortunately, nothing we eat tonight even hints of that worldly r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Sweet diver scallops crunch with grit and share their plate with bok choy so vague that you wouldn\u2019t recognize the vegetable with your eyes closed. Smoke is the lone flavor we detect from a plate of grilled shiitake mushrooms garnished with sesame brittle, cloying in its sweetness. Potato gnocchi with duck Bolognese \u2014 a case of the bland leading the bland \u2014 has us looking at our watches, too. Even basic dishes prove lackluster. A \u201cbarbecue spiced\u201d hanger steak of Kobe beef shows no sign of having been seasoned with anything sassier than salt. The meat is chewy. A pork rib, minimally garnished with a garlic clove and a bit of slow-roasted tomato, arrives dry. Cauliflower tossed with golden raisins and capers makes a respectable accompaniment, but we didn\u2019t log 50 miles to fill up on a side dish. Harrimans has been open three weeks when I make my maiden visit, and its youth and inexperience reveal themselves throughout the evening. Managers float in and out, forever asking how everything is, interjecting themselves just in time to step on the punch line of a joke or interrupt the climax of someone\u2019s story. The cheeriest of the cast is the sommelier, although she seems not to have read her own wine list. It offers a white wine that she insists she sells only on the banquet menu, until I point out its presence on the list at Harrimans. The restaurant\u2019s flaws are made worse by food that is tepid when it should be hot and a bill for three that comes close to $400 once drinks, wine, tax and gratuity are factored in. The cooking and the service are a dash better on a subsequent visit in mid-October, but neither food nor hospitality are without their off moments. After we place an o rder for blue cheese tater tots, our waiter repeats the request back to me. \u201cTots for you. Tots . I just love saying it!\u201d Eating the side dish, crisp with Japanese bread crumbs and sharp with Stilton cheese, is more fun than hearing the waiter read it back to me. From the grill comes a fine tuna steak; out of the fryer emerge onion rings worth polishing off. Oysters on the half-shell are also satisfying, but raw seafood reveals more about shopping habits than a chef\u2019s kitchen prowess. If Harrimans aims for a discerning clientele, it needs more lures like its caramelized Vidalia onion soup, a deconstructed recipe that finds a delicate Gruy\u00e8re custard, a crisp Parmesan tuile and smoky bacon crumbles in a broth richly flavored with veal stock and short rib jus. The first course, \u201cfrom the foothills,\u201d is a lovely concert of flavors and textures. Johnson, a vegan, can dine reasonably well in her signature restaurant, which lists eight or so meatless dishes. Indeed, the main course that everyone at my table wanted more of on my last visit was a simple-sounding grilled local eggplant. Lightly oiled and paired with mushrooms sauteed in a rich reduction of miso, vegetable stock and porcini juices, the arrangement had done a Houdini by the time plates were cleared. With some caveats, desserts leave a sweet impression. Endings include a fanciful many-layered chocolate cake that should lose its overly smoky bacon ice cream, and pillowy beignets served on a plate scattered with caramel popcorn and peanuts (think Cracker Jack) with a dipping sauce of garlic and cream that tastes better than it sounds.  The early diagnosis: Harrimans needs assistance. Is there a doctor in the house? Everyone on staff insists that there is; she needs to be paged, stat. \n\n 500 N.

Despite dutiful sunscreen use, Scott was getting burned. We spotted an acceptable-looking straw fedora, stepped into the shade of a shop and began to haggle.  \u201cHow much?\u201d Scott asked the shopkeeper in French. \u201cThree thousand dirham,\u201d the shopkeeper replied \u2014 the equivalent of about $360. Even though he knew that it was all part of the game, Scott flinched. As we\u2019d rehearsed, I began to point wordlessly at all the hat\u2019s flaws \u2014 spots where the brim seemed uneven, or where a straw poked loose \u2014 while he and the shopkeeper went back and forth: 100 dirham, 1,000 dirham, 120, 500. Finally, they shook hands on 160 dirham, about $20. It was our first time haggling for anything, and we walked out of the souk feeling pretty proud of ourselves. Scott had talked the guy down by 2,840 dirham, after all. It was a few more minutes before we realized that we were idiots. That $20 hat was definitely worth no more than $10. It didn\u2019t appear to be handmade. And yeah, the brim was a bit uneven. We spent the rest of the day trying to rationalize our poor mental math by talking ourselves into the purchase, as anyone with buyer\u2019s remorse would. \u201cA hat like that would probably cost the same at an H&M,\u201d I said, as if that were any consolation. The justifications got weaker and weaker: \u201cAt least it covers your head,\u201d I offered at one point. Of course, we knew better. Before I tagged along with Scott, my fiance, on a business trip to Paris and we skipped south for five days of vacation in Morocco, we\u2019d spent time planning our itinerary and dutifully educating ourselves on the customs of the country\u2019s markets, especially the Jemaa El-Fna, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the commercial center of Marrakesh\u2019s old city. We knew that we\u2019d have to haggle for everything \u2014 and that if we did it well, we had a chance of getting incredible bargains on beautiful decor for our new apartment. But we aren\u2019t very assertive people. So the idea that every transaction would be a confrontation was intimidating, especially because we knew that as foreigners, we\u2019d never have the upper hand. One of Scott\u2019s Moroccan-born friends laid it out for us over dinner in Paris, explaining the four prices you can pay in the Marrakesh souks: one price for American tourists. A slightly lower price for French tourists. A third, lower price for Parisian Moroccans, like our friends. And finally, the lowest price, for locals. We knew that the latter two weren\u2019t possible for us. But because Scott is fluent in French and knows a little Arabic, we thought that we could try for the second price \u2014 as long as I kept my mouth shut, since I don\u2019t speak either language. We devised a routine where I would act as a silent partner, conveying my opinion through a series of carefully choreographed, subtle gestures, which \u2014 even though they\u2019d all look like I was disapproving of the purchase, would actually be meant to encourage him. It was like shopping charades.  \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t **** \n\t\t\t\t\t\t After our failure with the hat \u2014 and a few unpleasant encounters with overly aggressive vendors in the souks \u2014 we needed to regroup. The manager of our riad told us about a fixed-price market near the Saadian Tombs that offered a stress-free shopping experience for wimps like us. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t A sweaty stroll took us past La Koutoubia and the ancient city gates to the market, which was stacked high with all the same goods you find in the souks \u2014 perfumes, carpets, tea services, lanterns and little souvenirs \u2014 in a shop with all the ambiance of a Kmart. The staff were the exact opposite of what you\u2019d find in the souks, making themselves scarce behind the fluorescent-lit stacks of rugs or piles of scarves. Smaller, touristy items were on the first floor, while nicer goods were upstairs. And though it was certainly not the shopping experience one comes to Morocco for, it was great for intel-gathering. We picked out a $75 rug that came with a tag explaining its handmade-in-Morocco provenance \u2014 something we couldn\u2019t be sure we were getting in the souks. We bought a few sets of qarkabeb, or Moroccan castanets, for our nieces and nephews, since they cost only about $2 each and it didn\u2019t seem worth the effort to haggle over something so small at the souks. And then we laid the foundation for all our future transactions by walking around the store, noting the prices for everything else there that we might want, to use as a base line for later negotiations. Hand-painted pottery and decorative tagines, for example, were incredibly cheap \u2014 about $6 for a vase or $4 for a small serving platter. Armed with this new information, we set off for Essaouira, a beach town three hours away by bus. It might have been the cool sea breezes or the laid-back vibe of the windsurfer-filled city, but shopping was easier in Essaouira. Vendors weren\u2019t as aggressive \u2014 making accidental eye contact with people in the street wouldn\u2019t result in their grabbing you by the arm, or, as one Jemaa El-Fna incident taught us, placing their trained monkey on your head \u2014 so when we encountered a vendor with a spread of teapots and platters, we put up our haggling dukes. Figuring that Scott\u2019s language skills weren\u2019t helping us get low prices, we employed a new strategy: accept a higher price only if the vendor would throw in a second item. And that\u2019s how we walked away with an ornate teapot and a sugar pot thrown in to sweeten the deal \u2014 though we later realized that in our enthusiasm, we\u2019d overlooked its bent leg. But it was all for the equivalent of about $25 and, bolstered by our victory, we moved on to pottery. A large black-and-white bowl, hand-painted in Fez with the lettering of an Arabic poem about honeybees and the sweetness of life, was our next buy, and for $20 we got the seller to throw in a decorative jar with the same pattern, as well as a hand-painted tile. We were on a roll. Perhaps too much of one. We got cocky. **** Back in Marrakesh, Scott and I set our sights on the metal lanterns that we\u2019d seen all over both cities, figuring that they\u2019d be the ideal bargain purchase: They were hand-painted but seemed mass-produced, and since they were easy to find, we could always go to another seller. Based on what we\u2019d seen shopping around, we thought that a small-size one would be worth about $8. At a lantern shop near the Saadian Tombs, an old shopkeeper offered his first price, which, as for nearly every item we haggled for, was 3,000 dirham. \n\t\t\t\t  Scott laughed, a bit too confidently. He pointed to an unfinished edge and demonstrated how difficult it was to open the lantern door. The shopkeeper brought out another lantern, and Scott found flaws with that one, too. Continuing my mute routine, I pointed to a necklace, in case we could get a two-for-one deal. The shopkeeper put it around my neck, and Scott named his price. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Since every shopkeeper\u2019s initial offer tended to be about 30 times the value of the item, Scott figured that he could lowball it and offer about a third of the price he intended to pay, assuming that he\u2019d get talked up to the item\u2019s actual value. It didn\u2019t work. Apparently only the shopkeepers can get away with naming outrageous prices \u2014 a fact we learned quickly, as the shopkeeper began screaming that we\u2019d insulted him and his family, pushing us out of his store. We scrambled away down the street and didn\u2019t try for another lantern. Our suitcases were full enough. **** Did we pay a fair price for any of our travel souvenirs? Definitely not. The pressure of haggling, combined with the mental math of the exchange rate (8.2 dirham to the dollar while we were there), is the perfect combination for getting ripped off. The sensory overload of being in the bustling souk can prevent shoppers from being the rational actors that they plan to be, no matter how much they\u2019ve prepped beforehand. And some would argue \u2014 and we wouldn\u2019t disagree \u2014 that as tourists from a wealthier country, we deserved to pay a higher price. But after five days of shopping in Morocco, we realized that there\u2019s no such thing as a fair price. Maybe it\u2019s just our psychological susceptibility to what\u2019s called choice-supportive bias, where you attribute positive qualities to a purchase to justify the money you spent, as I did with Scott\u2019s hat. Or maybe it\u2019s just pride. But when we look at our souvenirs and they bring us right back to our memories \u2014 of the scrubdown we got in the hammam, of galloping down the beach on a camel, of fragrant tagine dinners on rooftops as we listened to the call to prayer \u2014 we know that the price was right.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Maura Judkis", "wordCount": 1530}, {"date": "2013-10-24 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "On the trail of Henry Ward Beecher in Brooklyn, with stuffed doll in tow", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32e20125/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Con0Ethe0Etrail0Eof0Ehenry0Eward0Ebeecher0Ein0Ebrooklyn0Ewith0Estuffed0Edoll0Ein0Etow0C20A130C10A0C240C951ef8fc0E3b3b0E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "One sunny Sunday morning in Brooklyn Heights, you may have spotted a young woman posing a small stuffed doll of a man in front of various sites around town and snapping cellphone shots of him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t That would be my daughter. A perfectly normal college student who works at the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center in Hartford, Conn., during school breaks, Sophie has developed an admittedly eccentric obsession with Harriet\u2019s younger brother Henry Ward Beecher. (We\u2019re trying not to worry too much about her.) \n\n If you go: Brooklyn Heights \n\n Beecher was the charismatic 19th-century preacher whose dramatic abolitionist sermons and mock slave auctions did at least as much to lead to the freeing of the slaves as his sister\u2019s novel \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin.\u201d He delivered his sermons at Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, where he was summoned in 1847 to lead the fledgling congregation. Folks came from all over the world to hear him, with as many as 3,000 people cramming into the church when he preached. He was like a rock star. He\u2019s considerably less famous today, but he still holds enough historical sway that there\u2019s a stuffed-doll version of him on the market. A sympathetic friend of Sophie\u2019s gave her one; she\u2019s perhaps inordinately fond of it. This year marks the 200th anniversary of Beecher\u2019s birth and the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, for which he fervently pressed. So we Hugets decided to pay homage to \u201cThe Great Divine\u201d by visiting his spiritual home base in leafy, brownstone-lined Brooklyn Heights. Our first Beecher sighting was in Columbus Park, where a big honkin\u2019 statue of the man, wearing his enormous signature coat, looms. He looked old and grumpy to me. But seeing this statue was about as close as Sophie\u2019s ever going to get to meeting her idol. The way she squealed and ran toward him, you\u2019d have thought that she was a preteen who\u2019d spotted Justin Bieber. \n Sophie and her doll posed for pictures. Then we meandered over to Plymouth Church, where a different statue (created by Gutzon Borglum, who also sculpted Mount Rushmore) showed a younger, happier-looking Beecher. I was starting to see the appeal. Beecher\u2019s heavy-lidded eyes, lank hair and teddy-bear build are oddly alluring. For a dead dude, I mean. We took more pictures, then went inside for the 10 a.m. service. Sophie was happy to hold in her hands a copy of the revolutionary Beecher hymnal, the first to present music and lyrics together rather than as separate elements. Beecher designed it that way, to make it easier for the congregation to sing along. A young seminary student delivered the sermon that day; a congregant later told me that this, plus the mid-summerness of the day, probably accounted for the low turnout that morning. Sophie was surprised that so few people were there. She thinks that Beecher, or his legacy, deserves better. I think she\u2019d imagined being part of an enthusiastic, swooning crowd, stirred up by Beecher-like preachifying. Well, that didn\u2019t happen. But after the service, Sophie mounted the pulpit and stood right where Beecher himself had once stood. The Beecher doll posed there, too.   We joined our fellow churchgoers in the building\u2019s arcade, where we were offered hot and cold beverages, bagels and Goldfish crackers as we examined the historic artifacts on display (including a chunk of the original Plymouth Rock, a nod to the church\u2019s New England Puritan heritage). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t A \u201ctour\u201d was offered at 11:15. Our guide had us sit in the pews while she talked, rather than haul us around the building. She pointed out the stained-glass windows, which feature historical figures \u2014 including Beecher \u2014 associated with freedom, and the roughly 4,000-pipe organ. She listed some 19th-century luminaries who\u2019d been to Plymouth Church, including Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Clara Barton, Frederick Douglass, Mark Twain, William Makepeace Thackeray and Sojourner Truth. Besides the four of us, just two other people stayed for the tour. This meant that we had no competition for seats in the Abraham Lincoln pew. On Feb. 26, 1860, before he announced his candidacy for president, Lincoln attended Beecher\u2019s service at Plymouth. He\u2019d been invited to speak at the church, but at the last minute, organizers opted to move the event to the new Cooper Union in Manhattan, where Lincoln ended up delivering the career-making address in which he voiced his opposition to slavery. Apparently Lincoln attended church in New York only twice, both times at Plymouth. I\u2019m sure that his pew, marked with a silver plaque, has been reupholstered umpteen times. But it\u2019s still kind of cool to sit where the Great Emancipator once sat. Our guide explained that although there\u2019s little hard proof that the church was a stop on the Underground Railroad \u2014 participation was, after all, illegal, so few records were kept \u2014 its spacious basement probably served as a haven for slaves fleeing to freedom. The church\u2019s reputed role as \u201cGrand Central Depot\u201d helped land it a spot on the National Register of Historic Places. All that was interesting enough. But Sophie was disappointed when our guide ended her presentation without mentioning the salacious scandal that roiled Beecher\u2019s life. He was accused of having an affair with Elizabeth Tilton, a pious parishioner and the wife of his friend and colleague Theodore Tilton. The ensuing kerfuffle, culminating in Beecher\u2019s civil trial in 1875, riveted the nation for months. According to the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography \u201cThe Most Famous Man in America,\u201d by Debby Applegate, it earned more headlines than the whole Civil War. Beecher\u2019s jury wasn\u2019t able to reach a verdict. But the specter of adultery (and perhaps not with just Mrs. Tilton) shadowed him until his death in 1887. Beecher, his long-suffering wife, Eunice, and four of their children are buried a few miles from Plymouth Church in the historic Green-Wood Cemetery. Their marker, a rectangular hunk of granite with the potentially ironic inscription \u201cHe Thinketh No Evil,\u201d would be ostentatious for the likes of you or me. But in this cemetery packed with monumental monuments, it looks downright modest. One of my favorites among the pictures Sophie took that day shows her Henry doll lying next to the marker. Founded in 1838, Green-Wood was a fashionable final resting place for the well-heeled; its lush grounds made it a prime picnic spot, too, and for a time it attracted about a half-million people a year. The cemetery has 560,000 \u201cresidents,\u201d including Elizabeth Tilton, artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Boss Tweed, Leonard Bernstein, Samuel Morse and F.A.O. Schwarz. A map distributed at the main gate helped us navigate our way to Beecher\u2019s grave. Afterward, it was fun to wander the hilly, winding paths, which are lined with tall trees and awesome statuary (including pyramids, obelisks and, well, other really big objects) and in some spots offer grand, unaccustomed views of Manhattan. We kept our eyes out for monk parakeets, supposedly descendants of parrots that escaped years ago while being shipped through Kennedy Airport, though we didn\u2019t see any. When we got home, Sophie posted a few of her photos on Facebook under the heading \u201cWhat HWB did this summer.\u201d (Okay, maybe we should worry a smidge.) For a little stuffed fellow who\u2019d spent a summer day in a church and a graveyard chasing his dead former self, ol\u2019 Henry looked pretty happy. \n Huget is a freelance writer in Hartford, Conn.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Jennifer LaRue Huget", "wordCount": 1214}, {"date": "2013-10-24 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "This week\u2019s best travel bargains", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32e20127/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cthis0Eweeks0Ebest0Etravel0Ebargains0C20A130C10A0C240C71afb6260E3b4b0E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "What\u2019s the Deal? \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t This week\u2019s best travel bargains around the globe. \n Land \n \u25cf Richmond \u2019s Virginia Museum of Fine Arts has teamed up with hotels and Amtrak to offer package deals in conjunction with its Hollywood Costume exhibit , which runs from Nov. 9 to Feb. 17.

Smith, a technician at an aerospace company in Montgomery Village, ran a few numbers, with frustrating results. His return ticket cost $134, plus baggage fees. But United\u2019s change fee, which was recently raised from $150 to $200, would have completely zeroed out the value of his credit. So he booked a one-way return flight on Southwest Airlines for $152 \u2014 about the same as his original flight, including baggage fees \u2014 and never looked back. \u201cWhy should I spend any of my precious time on hold to cancel the ticket when I get absolutely nothing out of it?\u201d he says. \u201cTo do the airline a favor? Do you think they would do me any favors?\u201d No one knows exactly how many passengers pull a no-show when their change fees exceed the value of their ticket credit, deliberately depriving an airline of its ability to resell their seats. But by almost all accounts, their numbers are rising, as airlines continue to raise the price of changing a nonrefundable airline ticket. A United Airlines spokesman declined to comment on the subject of intentional no-shows in general, and Smith\u2019s case in particular. But it\u2019s hardly the only airline faced with customers who are angry about elevated change fees. When Laura Attwood wanted to change her recent ticket on Alaska Airlines from Anchorage to Ketchikan to an earlier flight on the same day, the carrier told her that it would be happy to make the change as long as she paid a $100 fee. She refused, choosing instead to cash in miles for a new flight. \u201cIn fact, I checked in and picked my seat on the flight I wasn\u2019t going to make, and confirmed it,\u201d says Attwood, who lives in Maple Bluff, Wis. \u201cThat way, they couldn\u2019t resell my seat. I was so mad that I had to pay a change fee.\u201d An Alaska Airlines representative acknowledged that the airline experiences deliberate no-shows on some flights, although she wouldn\u2019t say how many. Yet its change fees are far more reasonable than those of other airlines. Alaska charges $75 for an online change and $100 if it\u2019s done through a call center. Effective Oct. 30, its call-center change fee jumps to $125. But any changes made two months before a flight don\u2019t incur any fees. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue for us,\u201d says Marianne Lindsey, a spokeswoman for the airline. \u201cWhen we experience no-shows, it results in unused seats, which translates to lost revenue.\u201d The task of ensuring that these strategic absences aren\u2019t felt in the bottom line falls to airlines\u2019 sophisticated revenue-management programs, which are designed to oversell a flight based on a calculation that a certain number of passengers won\u2019t show up. \u201cOn certain fares, and on certain routes, there will be a higher number of no-shows,\u201d says Warren Lieberman, president of the technology consulting firm Veritec Solutions and one of the pioneers in the field of airline revenue management. \u201cIf they\u2019re selling tickets for $149, you can predict that more passengers will walk away from the fare, because the change fee is $200.\u201d   But the programs handling airline seat inventory, which are called yield-management systems, don\u2019t need to be reset when change fees increase. Rather, the algorithms are \u201cself-adjusting\u201d and will automatically tweak prices and seat availability to fit passengers\u2019 behavior, says Lieberman. In other words, they already know that passengers like Attwood and Smith won\u2019t make their flights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Hari Subramanian, a director for Sabre, a travel technology company, says that it\u2019s essential to use these systems to anticipate passenger behavior. \u201cNo one is going to come out and say, \u2018This is what we\u2019re willing to pay for a ticket,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cOr, \u2018We won\u2019t show up for the flight if you do that.\u2019\u2009\u201d In the airline industry, this kind of high-tech soothsaying is known as passenger choice modeling. It collects data about passenger behavior, including fares, connections, time of day and the type of traveler, and uses complex mathematical formulas to help airlines determine how many seats they can sell, and at what price. The modeling helps an airline make money. And airlines are making lots of money from change fees. The domestic airlines collected more than $2.5 billion in ticket-change fees in 2012, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, up from $2.4 billion a year before. But perhaps unwittingly, American carriers have also begun playing a cat-and-mouse game with their own customers, in which they raise fees, and passengers in turn try to sabotage the revenue-management systems by walking away from a ticket credit that has been partially or fully consumed by a change fee. Subramanian says that passengers can avoid the game by making smarter booking choices. The preferred airline solution is to buy a fully refundable ticket. But those fares are typically priced for business travelers on an expense account and can be three to four times as expensive as a nonrefundable ticket. He recommends looking for a so-called \u201cflexible fare,\u201d which some airlines offer \u2014 a special ticket that includes the benefit of waiving certain surcharges and would allow you to change your plans without having to pay a $200 fee.\n The long-term solution, of course, is for both sides to practice a little restraint. Already, airlines such as Alaska and JetBlue have shown that there\u2019s some middle ground, and their experience suggests that passengers are willing to accept some fees, as long as they\u2019re reasonable. Southwest Airlines seems to confound even the experts by having no change fees at all. And what if airlines and their customers can\u2019t come to an understanding? It\u2019s difficult to imagine change fees climbing any further without the government stepping in and saying, \u201cEnough.\u201d \n E-mail Christopher Elliott at chris@elliott.org .", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Christopher Elliott", "wordCount": 957}, {"date": "2013-10-24 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "What a Trip: In New Zealand, agog at every turn", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32e21346/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cwhat0Ea0Etrip0Ein0Enew0Ezealand0Eagog0Eat0Eevery0Eturn0C20A130C10A0C240Cf3ad46be0E3c10A0E11e30Eb6a90Eda62c264f40Ae0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "Our readers share tales of their rambles around the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n Who: Nikki Magaziner Mills of Washington and her husband, Keith Mills. \n\n Where, when, why: Because we both work in schools, summer means rest, rejuvenation \u2014 and travel! This summer we traveled to New Zealand for 15 days and broke the long flight home with a five-day stop in Bora Bora. \n\n Highlights and high points: At least eight times a day, we would look at each other and say: \u201cWow. What a gorgeous spot!\u201d From our drive through stunning scenery from Queenstown to Glenorchy and Paradise, to our journey to the perfectly silent and wistful Doubtful Sound, to seeing two sperm whales double-dive off the coast of Kaikoura, to listening to the rain howl in the Marlborough Sounds, to sampling wine in Marlborough and Martinborough and Hawke\u2019s Bay \u2014 the entire country, South Island and North, was astoundingly spectacular. We ate fresh-caught fish from a food truck near a \u201cDon\u2019t swim with the whales\u201d sign, hiked to waterfalls where baby seals played, saw a snow-covered volcano, climbed peaks for jaw-dropping views, enjoyed the wild turns of the weather. We have traveled a ton, and this was one of our best trips yet. \n\n Cultural connection or disconnect: We knew that Christchurch was still reeling from the effects of the earthquake in 2011, but we weren\u2019t prepared for a city still silenced. The rebuilding is starting \u2014 but only just. We stayed downtown in one of the few hotels that were open and ate in two of the few restaurants operating in the city center. But after a morning run in the tranquil Botanic Gardens, we stumbled upon a tea shop in the Re:Start mall that sold a best-ever scone and was full of the city bustle that we\u2019d hoped to see. Hope is the feeling we left with. Christchurch is a beautiful city; it needs tourists, and it needs to be rebuilt! \n\n Biggest laugh or cry: It was winter while we were there, and we spent at least part of every day of our trip monitoring the weather. Rain, wind, snow, perfect blue sky, sun, (little) earthquakes, road closures because of ice, a ferry crossing canceled because of high seas \u2014 we had it all. But it wasn\u2019t until the end of our trip, falling asleep to the roar of a rainstorm building in the valley near our little bed-and-breakfast, that we began to be thankful for every iteration of the weather. New Zealand is a \u201cwild and wonderful\u201d place \u2014 rain, sun or snow. The weather, even when it was bad, was perfect. \n\n How unexpected: New Zealand was so .\u2009.\u2009. easy. The driving, even on two-lane roads, was beautiful and easy. Navigating menus was easy. Meeting people and learning about each little town was easy. Finding a good two-hour hike on an hour\u2019s notice was easy. New Zealand is a little England with the scenery of Scotland, Switzerland, Iceland and the American West. Pictures can\u2019t do it justice. You have to see it, to be there, to understand its magic. \n\n Fondest memento or memory: Everyone I have ever met who has been to New Zealand says that they want to live there. We want to live there, too. We brought back three keychains and a few bottles of wine. We didn\u2019t shop in New Zealand. We looked. We talked. We listened. We ate and drank and settled into a lifestyle where the only goal of every hour was finding the next gorgeous spot. \n To tell us about your own trip, go to www.washingtonpost.com/travel and fill out the What a Trip form with your fondest memories, finest moments and favorite photos.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": null, "wordCount": 608}, {"date": "2013-10-20 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Nicaragua\u2019s Corn Islands cast a peculiar spell of their own", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32986044/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cnicaraguas0Ecorn0Eislands0Ecast0Ea0Epeculiar0Espell0Eof0Etheir0Eown0C20A130C10A0C170Cbecd4dba0Ec8820E11e20E8da70Ed274bc611a470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "The lobster trawlers bob like toys in a bathtub, tipping to and fro with every swell of gray sea. I watch from a crowd of Nicaraguans about to board the day\u2019s last panga, or public ferryboat, wondering whether the storm is as bad as it looks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The word I keep overhearing is \u201cangry.\u201d In Spanish, English and a Creole that sounds like English flipped inside out and set to a beat, everyone\u2019s calling the sea \u2014 our only highway \u2014 angry.  Such is the medley of languages 40-some miles off the coast of Nicaragua, on the Corn Islands. For centuries, these two landmasses \u2014 faint crumbs on the Caribbean map \u2014 had little to do with mainland Nicaragua. They were pirate territory, coconut-tree-lined refuges for the likes of the ruthless privateer Captain Morgan. \n\n Details: Corn Islands \n\n It wasn\u2019t until 1894 that Nicaragua claimed these fringe islands, but with no roadways linking the capital to the marshy eastern coastline, the Corns remained a world apart. To this day, islanders still bear surnames such as Quinn and Campbell, play more reggae than salsa, and every August, around the 27th, the day the slaves were emancipated, they crown another local beauty island queenla at a festival featuring crab soup. \n \n\n There\u2019s a Big Corn and a Little Corn, and the traveler\u2019s first quandary is to pick her Corn. I say quandary, because these islands are different in both style and scale (\u201cbig\u201d means 6,000 people; \u201clittle\u201d fewer than 1,000) and what separates them is about 10 miles of often turbulent sea. My plan was to depart for Little Corn as soon as my puddle jumper landed on the bigger island. The reason was simple: In every story I\u2019d read about Little Corn, the writer sounded a little shocked by how totally the place calmed him. Clearly, Little Corn cast a particular spell. But watching palm trees bend back in the rainy wind, I wonder: Do I really need to sleep in Eden tonight? Do I even believe in one? A place so calm it could chill even me out? I\u2019m good at motion; I get off on reaching the map\u2019s outer edge. Hunkering down under a pretty tree once I get there, however, is a lot, lot harder. \u201cHurry!\u201d Our captain cuts off my doubts and sends us all running with fire-drill panic toward our thrashing panga boat. I\u2019m seasick before it leaves the dock. My seat puts me between a jumpy man and the open sea. Trying not to look at the great girth and rolling height of each gray wave, I clutch the flapping plastic tarp that is our boat\u2019s umbrella, very ready to hear \u201cland-ho.\u201d At last, the captain takes aim at a skinny band of beach, and we\u2019re told to leap off the back of the panga, toward the kelp-strewn sand. Someone points out the sunset, but heads are down, nausea pervasive. I take a quick look: The sun is a gold blotch, bleeding pink into the wooly wreath of clouds. It could hardly look more distant, well on its way to the west of Nicaragua. \n To the lighthouse \n There are no cars on Little Corn. No buzz of motorcycles, no throttle or honk of any sort disturbs the air. You hear just two things as you wind around the cement footpath that is this island\u2019s only thoroughfare: the crash and withdrawal of waves.  \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Waves awoke me early, in a cerulean blue shack perched above the southern shore of Little Corn. Such is lodging at Casa Iguana, which borrows well from the palette of Corn Island homes \u2014 creamy purple, cool turquoise, the deep yellow of ripened mango. It\u2019s tucked back in a carefully manicured jungle, where hibiscus vines dome over damp dirt pathways. My shack-for-one, rustic and yet so ready for me (flashlight, mosquito net, three novels in a pile), invited the delusion that I could just stay here and live, overlooking an empty beach. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t So did the mood at the communal dinner. A ringleted blonde on the staff handed me a basil mojito, then plantain chips (on the house!). The catch of the day was cooking somewhere, as guests pattered in, barefoot. A Californian named Blake struggled to tell me when he\u2019d arrived \u2014 \u201cTuesday?\u201d How soon I could feel the complete dissolve of home\u2019s priorities. Was it ludicrous to ask about a wireless signal here, where fireflies beaded the darkness and pirates once strung up hammocks? \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t I did, only to wish that I hadn\u2019t. The last thing one should gaze into from Little Corn Island is a full inbox. I shut the hotel laptop and drifted back toward the dinner table, where everyone was talking scuba. Corn Island travelers chat about diving conditions the way bankers discuss stocks \u2014 everything here hinges on the clarity of the sea. A non-diver, I couldn\u2019t get into it, so I wandered off into the inky dark toward my abode, intent on exploring Little Corn first thing in the morning. It\u2019s early \u2014 profanely early \u2014 when I step outside. With neither a watch nor a phone, I read the only available time clues: bare feet dangling from hammocks, and a few toes peeking out from shored boats. It\u2019s the crack of dawn on Little Corn Island. Harris is the first alert person I meet. An older man with the muscles of a sailor, Harris is scraping the scales off a yellowtail snapper, as the waves curl toward the sand just behind him. A native of the island, Harris assures me that I\u2019ve come to the better Corn. Why? \u201cChildren can run around without the scare of cars.\u201d The foot traffic is gentle as I step back onto the path, and without meaning or trying, I merge with Ronald and Richard. Both 21, both wearing baggy jeans to their shins, and both members of an Afro-Caribbean group called Garifuna, Ronald and Richard could pass for twins. Their native language, a mix of Arawak, Carib, English, French and Spanish, speaks to how many cultures fused along the Atlantic coast of Central America. It\u2019s dizzying to keep up with these polylingual young men. Ronald and Richard salute passersby in Creole (\u201cYow bigs!\u201d), echo back a few holas, and flip between singing American rap, Latino pop and Bob Marley like a radio on scan. There\u2019s something familiar about my dynamic with these two, and I put my finger on it only after we\u2019ve wedged through barbed wire fences, crossed a cattle pasture, and lobbed bruised mangoes up at a tree until it gave us the fresh ones, and we\u2019re standing below a lighthouse that Ronald and Richard gently dare me to climb. Childhood: It all reminds me an awful lot of life at age 11. Maybe that\u2019s the sort of paradise I\u2019m in the mood for, more than the Eden of escape, the one that loops you back to a simpler, playful time. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t The Little Corn lighthouse is no innocent dare, though. You climb it the way you would a ladder \u2014 straight up. And if you happen to have just peeled a sticky mango, it feels more like three grip-resistant ladders, back to back. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cTake your time, take your time,\u201d coos Ronald, ahead of me. Moving slowly is an expected theme on any Caribbean island, but I have to wonder, the sixth time Ronald repeats his mantra, whether slowness is more like a virtue on the Corns. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t I\u2019m doing okay until the brightness strikes. A wash of light means that we\u2019ve cleared the tree line. We are higher than the tallest coconut trees on Little Corn Island. \n\n Take your time, take your time. \n\n My breathing gets loud, my pauses long. At last, my sticky hand finds the platform. It\u2019s round and towering, like a crow\u2019s nest. Inhaling, I taste salt \u2014 the ocean is that close. Land hogs so little of this panorama, the island\u2019s outline hugging us tightly. Little Corn is a single comma on an otherwise blue sheet. Many other things keep this Corn feeling little, and the lighthouse is a prime place to take stock: no hotel pools, no tennis courts, nothing taller than two stories. A boutique hotel called Yemaya is under construction, I\u2019m told, but the plans sound small-scale, unlikely to upset the island\u2019s treetop-to-rooftop ratio. My gaze drifts offshore, to the marbled waters that distinguish Corn Island beaches in photographs. It\u2019s a curious patchwork of navy and aqua, like two different oceans, about to mix hues. But the contrast only intensifies as the sun does; by midday it\u2019s a stunning patchwork, some mirage of the sea, or in my case, a summons to slip underwater. \n Getting it right \n \n\n Walk down the beach; look for a boat; find the guy who takes out snorkelers; bring $20. \n\n The snorkeling guy isn\u2019t around, but I do find men drinking 11 a.m. beer in the shade. One of them is Harris, from the other side of the island, which felt like a great coincidence, until I remembered that the \u201cother side of the island\u201d was what we\u2019d call, anywhere else, \u201cnext door.\u201d Little Corn is little more than one square mile.\n I beam at my old friend (Harris!) and he responds in kind, offering to take me snorkeling. What makes hospitality in the Corns so disarming is how uncalled for, in context, it feels. In a place this idyllic, no one has to be nice. And Harris certainly doesn\u2019t need (nor will he accept) my $20 bill. He owns both a hotel and the lobster trawler on the horizon. Is it possible? Could Harris just care that I snorkel? The men in the shade set down their beers, rise to their feet, and push Harris and me off the beach in a motorboat called the Sea Prince. The water glints with so much light that I have to visor my eyes with one hand, and it\u2019s clear enough to count the mustard-colored patches of corals, to see every ripple in the white sand below. Hours from now, I will feel like a cooked lobster \u2014 the skin on my back the most alarming shade of pink in the palette \u2014 but right now, barefoot and bikinied and leaning forward on the tipped-up bow of a speeding boat, I feel like the Sea Queen. \n\t\t\t\t  I don\u2019t tell Harris about my phobia of ocean swimming \u2014 a fear of fish (and worse) nibbling at my feet. I don\u2019t have to, it turns out, because snorkeling in water this clear is the perfect cure. Head submerged, I can see it all, the swerving and darting and breezy wafting of every size of fish. How silly: to think that my plain white toes could garner any attention down here. A school of jet-black fish with long whiskers and shimmery blue stripes turns past me with the clean synchronicity of ballerinas, and my hands stretch right out. Apparently, I want to pet them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Harris spots a barracuda, and that\u2019s enough to get me wriggling back into the Sea Prince. Besides, my time is short \u2014 I\u2019m catching the afternoon panga boat back to Big Corn. This bothers Harris. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come back,\u201d he says, shaking his head at my haste.  But as I scamper down the beach and grab a loaf of coconut bread from the little pink house that everyone agrees is the place for the baked variety of \u201ccoco food,\u201d I feel secretly as if I got it right. Perhaps the perfect time to leave is just before the sunburn shows, before the waves dull into white noise, before I run into Harris a third time. Maybe it\u2019s best to get on your way, right when you\u2019re tempted to call a place perfect? \n A round of lobster \n I\u2019m encased in red heat by the time I reach Big Corn. New freckles are menacingly dark. Quick movements hurt. I give up all ambitions of meeting the island beauty queen and finding the descendants of pirates, and let the end of my journey be about one thing: lobster. There\u2019s a dish called rondon that brings the flesh of fresh lobster together with the milk of local coconuts, simmers the pairing in garlic and herbs, adding a full medley of Central American starches and sometimes, another whole fish. It sounds to me like a dinner that I\u2019ll one day tell my grandchildren about. I pick a hotel on the basis of the owner\u2019s culinary reputation, overlooking its position beside a fish-processing plant. The plant\u2019s constant thrumming reminds me that I\u2019m now on the \u201cworking island,\u201d as people call Big Corn when differentiating between the two isles. I\u2019m willing to forgo both scenery and serenity for a taste of the best lobster stew. Rondon cooks so slowly that I have to put in my order at breakfast. Still, when I slide onto the barstool of the hotel restaurant after noon, I\u2019m told to wait. I remember the warning I read on a local tourism Web site: \u201cOrder before you\u2019re hungry.\u201d Someone really should clarify: Order a full day before you\u2019re hungry. Two bar stools down sits Cliff, a lumberjack of an American, here to study the practices of lobster divers on Big Corn. Who better to prime me for my feast? We talk about the life span of the lobster: the 20 years that it might spend clicking across the ocean floor before venturing into a Corn Islander\u2019s trap. Nicaragua\u2019s third-largest export is lobster, and the bulk of it, according to Cliff, comes from the shallow continental shelf spreading around the Corns. The kitchen door swings open, and my rondon floats toward me. I see no pink legs, no pincers, no shell whatsoever in my coconut broth. That\u2019s my first praise for how Corn Islanders cook lobster. They understand that the cracking and peeling, all the labor of flavoring, should be done behind the scenes. Nobody wears a bib here, or finishes with a moist towelette. I just slice each lobster morsel into four more, to savor as slowly as possible this expertly slow-cooked stew. I patter back to my hotel room, lobster-hued, lobster-full. Without bothering to hit the lights, I fall right into the local pose, napping with my bare feet dangling off the bed, finally under some kind of spell. \n Kinder is the author of \u201c Delaying the Real World \u201d and teaches travel and essay writing at Yale.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Colleen Kinder", "wordCount": 2379}, {"date": "2013-10-20 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Taking it slow and simple on the Caribbean island of Nevis", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32986045/sc/4/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Ctaking0Eit0Eslow0Eand0Esimple0Eon0Ethe0Ecaribbean0Eisland0Eof0Enevis0C20A130C10A0C170Cca6132e80E320A10E11e30E9c680E1cf643210A30A0A0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "It begins even before I clear customs in St. Kitts, a sense that Nevis is an island apart from others in the Caribbean. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t A guy with a guitar slung on his back starts chatting with people beside me in the queue, and before long, I\u2019m in a three-way conversation, learning where to hear live music, which restaurants are closed on Mondays, and where to find trails leading to newly discovered waterfalls.

Nevis (pronounced \u201cNEE-vis\u201d), six miles wide by eight miles long, is the smaller of two sister islands, former British colonies that make up the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis. Located in the leeward portion of the Caribbean\u2019s Lesser Antilles, both islands have lush foliage, dormant volcanoes and uncrowded beaches, though Nevis, population 12,000, is quieter and less developed than its big sis.

Crossing the two-mile channel to Nevis, we arrive at a destination with one sleepy harbor town and more than 50 churches, where wild sheep and donkeys roam freely, an island reported to have more vervet monkeys than people. \u201cNevis offers a distinctive sense of disconnect, which I think is so difficult to find in today\u2019s global world,\u201d said Nancy Beckham, a former Nevis resident whom I met in Miami. \u201cNo buildings are higher than a coconut palm, there aren\u2019t many vehicles, the people are educated and kind, the surroundings are lush and green, and there\u2019s plenty to explore, including wonderful historical ruins that have disappeared from other Caribbean islands.\u201d For a recent visit \u2014 my second in five years \u2014 I lured my pal Libby down from Portland, Maine, with promises of swimming, touring, cocktail imbibing, eating and lounging in the sun. Call it Lollygagging 101. \n A taste of sugar \n Arriving at our hotel, Montpelier Plantation & Beach, Libby and I were greeted by Ziggy, a friendly, honey-colored hound dog. Javier Stanley, a bartender with an oval face and a thousand-watt smile, served us a welcoming rum punch in a tall chilled glass. \u201cNevis is simple, subtle,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not too much hustle and bustle.\u201d \u201cCompared to other Caribbean nations, Nevis is a step back in time,\u201d said Nikolas Mantas, the food and beverage manager. And he meant that in a good way. Settling into island life was as easy as kicking off our shoes. After our cocktail and a dip in the pool, we took a taxi to Lime, a rustic beachside restaurant and bar with wood floors and a porch looking out at the stars. Michael Jackson rocked the sound system \u2014 \u201cOh baby, give me one more chance\u201d \u2014 and we sighed over crisp tania (an island root vegetable) fritters, watermelon and feta cheese salad, and grilled grouper, sauteed onions and pickles folded in a flour tortilla. We washed it all down with a cold Carib beer.   In the morning, wild sheep were grazing outside our room as the sun rose hot on a breezy day. The hotel had once been a sugar plantation \u2014 complete with an old mill where you can now dine in candlelit splendor \u2014 one of several renovated plantations on this island, vestiges of an industry that dominated the economy in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Montpelier\u2019s 19 cottage rooms, with wooden beams, lazy ceiling fans and louvered windows, are reminiscent of a time when the island was a stomping ground for well-heeled British colonists such as Lord Horatio Nelson, who married Frances Nisbet beneath a silk-cotton tree on the property. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Montpelier sits high on a mountain slope, near the often cloud-shrouded Nevis Peak (3,232 feet), and offers partial views of the distant windward shore. (The hotel offers daily shuttle service to a private beach on the leeward side.) Swimming backstroke in the pool, watching clouds skitter through the cerulean sky, I was acutely aware of being on an island afloat in a vast, pale green sea.  Slipping out of the pool and into a robe, I padded to the adjacent veranda, where Libby was sipping her morning coffee. Over a full Nevisian breakfast \u2014 farm-fresh eggs, local pork sausage and French toast with nutmeg and island honey \u2014 we met Dr. Erin Moore and his wife, Kara Wanchick, from Jacksonville, Fla. This was their fifth visit to the island since they\u2019d gotten married on Montpelier\u2019s beach three years earlier. \u201cIf you come to Nevis, come with a sense of adventure,\u201d said Moore, who showed me his Nevis driver\u2019s license, a square pink card ($25). Moore and Wanchick like to explore the island by Jeep, finding small coves and beaches each time they return. He recommended renting a car through the hotel ($50 a day) rather than directly through rental companies ($75 to $125 a day). Neither Libby nor I felt comfortable driving \u201cEnglish style\u201d \u2014 on the opposite side of the road \u2014 so we asked the hotel to hire a driver for a day of touring. Alston Smithen, a.k.a. \u201cChamp,\u201d arrived in his dusty, trusty passenger van, and we set off to circumambulate the island at a leisurely pace. \n Sleepy sites \n Champ\u2019s lilting voice provided a backdrop to our tour. We stopped at the remains of the New River Estate Sugar Mill, the last operating sugar mill on the island (closed in the 1950s), where sunlight filtered through vines partially covering a crumbling chimney and the rusting gears of steam-driven cane crushers. At Nisbet Plantation Beach Club, another former sugar plantation turned inn, patrons in a shaded beachside bar sipped frozen rum cocktails and nibbled quesadillas with a side of plantains. \u201cThe lady married to Admiral Nelson came from this plantation,\u201d said Champ. High on a bluff overlooking St. Kitts, St. Thomas\u2019s Lowland Church, circa 1643, is the oldest church on the island, and supposedly the oldest Anglican church in the Caribbean. Thirsty, I requested a detour to Mansa\u2019s Last Stop, a roadside store stocked with staple groceries, beer, produce grown on a small organic farm and homemade seasonal juices such as carambola, sorrel, passion fruit and cucumber. Out in the extensive growing fields behind the shop, we found Mervin \u201cMansa\u201d Tyson, a reed-thin man with Rasta dreads and a big smile, who offered us a tomato, warm and sweet off the vine.   A low key, laid-back approach to tourism is what I appreciate about the island, so it was a surprise to learn that Nevis was home to the first resort for Europeans in the Caribbean. The therapeutic hot springs at the Bath Hotel, built in 1778, attracted such noteworthy visitors as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Prince William Henry, the Duke of Clarence. The hotel is closed now, but you can still dip into its hot springs in a small outdoor pool. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t We made a pit stop for sunscreen in the capital city of Charlestown, where street names such as Prince William and Prince Charles recall the British colony, and the more quirkily named Featherbed Alley and Upper Happy Hill Drive made me smile. With perhaps the sleepiest town center I\u2019ve ever encountered, Charlestown is home to the ferry terminal to St. Kitts, the tourism office, a sports store, a sports bar, government offices, Chinese restaurants (the island version of fast food), small souvenir shops, a pharmacy, banks and, on certain days, a market selling spices, fruit and produce.  \u201cIn Charlestown, everything closes at 5 p.m.,\u201d said Champ. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost town.\u201d \n Island time \n Nightlife on the island consists of a rotating schedule of special dinners \u2014 pig roasts, West Indian barbecues, seafood grills \u2014 sponsored by hotels, plantation inns and bars, many times featuring live local string bands or Calypso music. On Friday nights, the Water Department sponsors a cookout with chicken, ribs, music and beer. Charlestown is celebrated as the birthplace of Alexander Hamilton, a U.S. Founding Father and first secretary of the Treasury, and his family home has been reconstructed as a museum. A lesser-known fact is that in the 17th and 18th centuries, Charlestown was home to Sephardic Jews expelled from Brazil who were active participants in the sugar cane growing and processing industry. In the Jewish cemetery, grave markers bear inscriptions carved in Hebrew, English and Portuguese. I was curious to see the developments at the Golden Rock Inn, another former sugar plantation that, at the time of my previous visit, had been purchased by New York artist Brice Marden and his wife, Helen. As we made our way up the steep, narrow road, our progress was blocked by an ambulance. In a perfect example of \u201cisland time,\u201d Champ didn\u2019t honk the horn or shout or get out to investigate. He simply pulled over to the side of the road and waited. \u201cAn old lady lives here,\u201d he offered as explanation. \u201cShe must not be feeling well today.\u201d A full 10 minutes later, the ambulance driver escorted an elderly woman to the van, helped her in, and we continued on our way. Miami-based landscape architect Raymond Jungles worked with the Mardens to redesign the gardens and the grounds at the Golden Rock, and the result is a managed chaotic wildness that suits the island and the artists. Stone paths meander past rock formations, cacti, succulents and enormous palm fronds to colorful cottages scattered across the hillside. A simple swimming pool overlooks the sea, and a new outdoor dining area, designed by architect Ed Tuttle, hosted visitors feasting on a lunch of conch chowder, grilled lobster tail and jerk pork sandwiches. Golden Rock is also the trailhead for a hiking path through the rain forest, one of many trails on the island. \n The fantasy life \n Our favorite meals were the simplest ones. At Montpelier one morning, we watched a cooking demonstration by chef Benjamin Voisin and gobbled the results at lunch beside the pool: chilled cucumber and lemongrass gazpacho, and pan-seared red snapper with papaya, red onion, green pepper and tomato salsa. \u201cNinety percent of the fruits and vegetables I use come from the island,\u201d said Voisin. \u201cIt\u2019s the real Caribbean. Raw and unspoiled.\u201d Diane Hallstrom, who works in the gift shop at the nearby Botanical Gardens of Nevis, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re known as a green island. We have wind power. We\u2019re quiet. We\u2019re peaceful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re back to nature. There\u2019s no gambling, no casino, and no traffic.\u201d A visit to Nevis isn\u2019t complete without sampling a Killer Bee rum punch at Sunshine\u2019s Beach Bar & Grill. Sunshine himself served us conch fritters with a side of his special hot sauce. We hid from the heat of the day under jaunty saffron-hued umbrellas, watching kayakers paddle past as the house monkey chugged a beer. (\u201cCome take a photo with the monkey 5 U$,\u201d read the sign on the cage.) Reggae music played, palm trees swayed, the warm turquoise sea beckoned, and life was pretty much perfect. \u201cYou realize this is a complete fantasy,\u201d I said to Libby. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cThat\u2019s why we travel. Real life is tedious enough.\u201d True, that. \n Regis writes about travel and food and blogs about oysters at www.necee.com .", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Necee Regis", "wordCount": 1890}, {"date": "2013-10-20 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "The Turks and Caicos Islands, a haven of seaside splendor and ease", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32979c45/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cthe0Eturks0Eand0Ecaicos0Eislands0Ea0Ehaven0Eof0Eseaside0Esplendor0Eand0Eease0C20A130C10A0C170C6d4d87ae0E31e90E11e30E9c680E1cf643210A30A0A0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "We fell in love even before touchdown. The clouds that had blocked our view during the flight to Turks and Caicos mercifully dispersed right before we landed, and we caught our first glimpse of the radiant sea. We watched as the little snail-shaped island of Providenciales materialized in the middle of the ocean, dazzled by the turquoise, aquamarine and emerald hues of the water surrounding it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n Details: Turks and Caicos Islands \n\n Throughout our stay, my husband and I made a point of never letting that water out of our sight. We found it a force so relaxing that it quickly canceled out the noise of daily life. Up to that point, 2013 had been a frantic year. Work and family had taken us all over the world, including to such taxing destinations as Afghanistan and Syria. When not traveling, we\u2019d been drowned in paperwork buying a condo. So we\u2019d shopped for a nearby holiday destination where we could just lie back and enjoy nature\u2019s show for a while. A couple of friends who\u2019d just returned from a vacation there recommended the still relatively unknown Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). It was the perfect place, they assured us, to escape the grind. This British Overseas Territory about 500 miles southeast of Miami consists of 40 islands and cays, only eight of which are inhabited, home to a grand total of 30,000 year-round residents. As the name suggests, TCI is made up of two archipelagos: To the east are the Turks islands, named after the native Turk\u2019s head cactus, and to the west are the Caicos, a word derived from \u201ccaya hico,\u201d which, in the language of the indigenous Lucayan Indians, means \u201cstring of islands.\u201d Providenciales, one of the Caicos, boasts the islands\u2019 largest airport and is the only real tourist hub, although it\u2019s a far cry from such overdeveloped destinations as Jamaica\u2019s Montego Bay. Provo, as the locals call it, is only 38 square miles, and while much of its development has happened in just the past decade, today its infrastructure is much improved, and scattered low-rise strip malls have sprouted in the interior. There is even a small casino. The magnificent coast has a growing but still limited number of handsome resorts and villas, along with good restaurants and bars. These are concentrated on the north shore, overlooking the beautiful and aptly named Grace Bay. During our nine-day stay, my husband and I took countless strolls along Grace Bay Beach\u2019s 12-mile stretch of uncontaminated, sparkling white sand. Sometimes we walked more than an hour each way to reach some faraway waterfront cafe, returning to our hotel in complete darkness, our steps illuminated only by the stars and the moon. We always made sure that sunset would find us somewhere sipping local Turk\u2019s Head beer or Bambarra rum with a front-row seat on the ocean and that dipping orange ball of fire. Because we can be lazy and bookwormy, a good chunk of our time on TCI was spent swimming in the calm, pool-like ocean water or planted on beach chairs with our heads buried in crime novels, our true holiday obsession. But Grace Bay\u2019s gleaming sea also spurred us onto a Hobie Cat, a toy catamaran that our hotel, like most others, made available to guests for free. It\u2019s supposedly a craft that anybody can sail, so light and safe that it\u2019s practically impossible to sink. We, however, managed to capsize the thing about 15 minutes into our ride and, unable to right it, we had to be rescued, to my husband\u2019s chagrin, by a lifeguard on a motorboat.   So we moved on to parasailing as a more rewarding way of feeding our obsession with the color of the water and of observing its many shades \u2014 easily a half-dozen \u2014 from above. We\u2019d never done anything like this before, so we voiced our concerns about the rope breaking and us flying away to Capt. Conrad Brown, who picked us up in his motorboat right in front of our hotel. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cYou guys just made it through the hardest part of the trip,\u201d Brown told us the moment we climbed onto his boat. Hand in hand, roped to a parachute and swinging from side to side with each gust of wind, we marveled at the sweeping views all the way out to the other coast and down to the bottom of the sea floor. I could swear that we saw a giant stingray trawling the seabed 100 feet below us. \n Beach bumming \n Grace Bay isn\u2019t the only extraordinary beach on Provo. So we rented a scooter to explore the island further. Riding along the back roads, with little traffic and the hot Caribbean breeze pressing against our skin, was a liberating experience. It took us both back to our youth, to days of riding scooters through the streets of Italy and India. Although this time we were wearing helmets. Our first stop was Long Bay Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d Larry Dworetsky of Paradise Scooters told us while giving us his very own \u201cunguided guided tour\u201d of the island. \u201cIf there\u2019s wind, the kite surfers are out and you can watch them jump 30 feet in the air. If there\u2019s no wind, that\u2019s the most beautiful beach here and you have it all to yourselves.\u201d We were lucky enough to have a bit of both: The wind was blowing, and a couple of kite surfers filled the sky with their acrobatics, but there was barely anyone else around. Five Cays Beach has the same white sand and turquoise water as every place on Providenciales, but it\u2019s more of a food and entertainment destination. The main feature is Bugaloo\u2019s, a beach shack that everybody raves about. We went, sat with our feet buried in the sand and drank rum punch to the sound of live music. \u201cYou guys are great,\u201d the lead singer of the Island Boys, a Bob Marley cover band, shouted to the crowd of tourists and locals. \u201cJust as good as the weather!\u201d We also had our first taste of conch, a large sea snail that\u2019s TCI\u2019s premier food group. Bugaloo\u2019s spicy fritters are not to be missed, and the 35-year-old cook, Manno, makes sure to use nothing but the freshest conch. Day in and day out, he stands beneath a green beach umbrella and bends over a large wooden chest filled with ice and conch. He patiently pulls the meat out of the big flashy shell and cleans it. Whenever the chest empties, he walks a short distance into the water \u2014 shoes, shorts, T-shirt and all \u2014 dragging a large raft behind him and taking an occasional dive to refill it with conch. While describing this process to me on a Sunday afternoon, Manno suddenly extracted a gooey, transparent string of something from a shell and ate it avidly. It was the snail\u2019s reproductive organ, he told me with some pride, supposedly a boon to a man\u2019s sexual prowess.   Local aphrodisiacs aside, Provo, with its shimmering beaches and waters and its abundant seafood, went a long way toward fulfilling our need for tranquillity. But we wanted to see whether we could get even farther away from civilization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Getting lost \n North Caicos and Middle Caicos are the two largest islands. With a combined population of only about 2,500, they\u2019re also a vast expanse of lush and partially impenetrable vegetation. Calling them quaint and slow-paced would be an understatement. Take the village of Kew, on North Caicos. Famous for a donkey named Liza that\u2019s known to roam the streets (alas, we never saw her), Kew is so small and unassuming that we rode right through it twice before realizing that was it. Driving down the only two-lane highway in our beat-up rental car, we stopped at a number of beaches where we were the only two people in sight. It was an exhilarating feeling that I\u2019d never experienced before, even though I\u2019ve traveled to other Caribbean destinations. Mudjin Harbour, on Middle Caicos, is one of the better-known beaches, and a highlight. Its name is a distortion of \u201cBermudian Harbor,\u201d and it comprises a sequence of coves carved into the coastline and hidden from view by imposing limestone cliffs. But even more exquisite was Three Marys Cays Beach in the northwestern corner of North Caicos. It\u2019s barely marked on the map, and there are no signs to guide travelers to it. We bumped along on dirt roads for a good half-hour and nearly got lost a few times. A trio of small, mushroomlike islets seemingly floats above the water just off the beach and provided my husband with a serendipitous snorkeling haven. Sparsely inhabited and still somewhat wild, we found North Caicos and Middle Caicos to be lands of truly outsize fantasies, where we could even allow ourselves to dream of buying a shack on the beach one day and retiring there to write to the sound of crashing waves. \n Reefing it \n Back on Provo, we had one last mission before leaving: a trip to the coral reef. Anthony, a.k.a. Capt. Blue, who has guided trips to the reef for more than 15 years, showed us around what\u2019s now practically his home, a water so full of life \u2014 some fish electric blue and yellow , others the colors of a rainbow \u2014 that we found it hard to believe that it wasn\u2019t an aquarium. A nurse shark, long and dark, swam unhurriedly a few feet below us. Capt. Blue also took us cay-hopping. Cays are small, sandy islands that sit above the reef. They lie in a nearly continuous line north of Providenciales, almost forming a natural bridge to North Caicos. Some are uninhabited, while others house lavish resorts and the mansions of celebrities such as Alec Baldwin, Donna Karan and Bruce Willis. A cay named Little Water is home to a nature reserve and to several thousand iguanas, which walk around undisturbed and are happy to check out any tourists up close and personal, edging remarkably near their feet. (Careful, ladies: They\u2019re attracted to red toenails!) As we stood beneath a bright blue sky, surrounded by lush vegetation, white sand and crystal-clear water, I told Anthony that in my next life, I wouldn\u2019t mind being born an iguana on Little Water Cay. He laughed. \u201cI ain\u2019t coming back here next time,\u201d he said. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve watched things from sea level. I wouldn\u2019t mind being an eagle for a change.\u201d Good for him, I thought. But as for me, I couldn\u2019t imagine ever getting tired of TCI. \n Pasquali is a freelance journalist based in Washington.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Valentina Pasquali", "wordCount": 1753}, {"date": "2013-10-18 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Taking a Hatfield-McCoy tour in Pike County, Kentucky", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32986046/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Ctaking0Ea0Ehatfield0Emccoy0Etour0Ein0Epike0Ecounty0Ekentucky0C20A130C10A0C170C52a7136e0E35dd0E11e30E80Ac60E7e6dd8d22d8f0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "There was no practical explanation for why I was climbing up a steep, rocky path in a forgotten little corner of West Virginia, searching for the grave of Devil Anse Hatfield, the leader of the notorious Hatfield clan of Hatfield-McCoy infamy. The feud has been over for more than 100 years, and its participants aren\u2019t worth venerating. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But curiosity is a powerful thing, and on a recent road trip through West Virginia and Kentucky with my wife and two sons, I ventured off the interstates onto a series of winding backroads to learn more about America\u2019s most famous family feud.  \n\n If you go: Pikeville, Ky. \n\n There\u2019s been a resurgence of interest in the Hatfields and McCoys since the History Channel premiered a miniseries starring Kevin Costner last year and a reality show tracking the lives of the families\u2019 descendants in August. Tourism officials in West Virginia and Kentucky have scrambled to capitalize on the public interest, but the feud is still viewed through a different lens on each side of the Tug River, which separates the two states. The Hatfield Family Cemetery is next to a crumbling abandoned church on a forlorn section of Route 44 in Sarah Ann, W.Va. There\u2019s an imposing iron sign and three tall wooden crosses staked up on a tree-covered hill, but the place is mostly overgrown and neglected. As I climbed the unpaved path to the old hilltop cemetery, I passed a handwritten sign that warned, \u201cSmile! You are now being videoed due to theft!\u201d When William Anderson \u201cDevil Anse\u201d Hatfield died of pneumonia at 81, his heirs sent photos of him to a craftsman in Italy, who constructed an impressive marble statue with his likeness. The statue towers over all the other memorials in the derelict cemetery. We were the only visitors on a Friday afternoon. Many of the plots are uncared for; some are buried beneath shrubbery, while others can be reached only after a walk down narrow footpaths. The cemetery is on the National Register of Historic Places, but it\u2019s unclear who owns the land, so a plan to refurbish the place in the hope of luring tourists hasn\u2019t gotten off the ground. We crossed the Tug River, and steps across the Kentucky state line, we met two off-duty firemen who were guzzling beer from 16-ounce cans at the site of the Pawpaw Massacre. In 1882, members of the Hatfield clan tied three sons of Randall McCoy, the leader of the McCoy clan, to pawpaw trees and executed them in retaliation for a stabbing incident at an Election Day party. A few miles to the west, next to the McCarr post office, we got out to have a look at a reconstructed log cabin at the so-called Hog Trial Site. Although some historians trace the feud\u2019s origins to a killing in 1865, others say the feud really got rolling in 1878 when Randall McCoy took Floyd Hatfield to court for allegedly stealing his pig \u2014 and lost. Two years after the verdict, members of the McCoy clan killed the man who had testified that the animal belonged to Floyd Hatfield, sparking a cycle of violence that didn\u2019t abate until 1890, when Ellison \u201cCottontop\u201d Mounts was hanged for the murder of Alifair McCoy. (Some historians say that the final feud killing took place in 1947, when Allen Hatfield, the chief of police of Matewan, W.Va., raided a brothel and exchanged gunfire with an angry patron, a McCoy, who died in the incident.)   The next morning, I met Jay Shepherd and Jesse Bowling from the Pike County Tourism, Convention & Visitors Bureau at the Hampton Inn in Pikeville, Ky., where they lead Saturday morning Hatfield & McCoy tours year-round. Shepherd explained that the proceeds are earmarked for the creation of a statue dedicated to Randall McCoy. Not exactly a save-the-starving-children-in-Africa cause, but I was game. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Shepherd said that since the premiere of the History Channel miniseries in the spring of last year, the three-person tourism office has been inundated with brochure requests. \u201cSome people said no one\u2019s going to visit a place where a whole lot of people died,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell \u2019em, \u2018You ever heard of Salem? Ever heard of Gettysburg?\u2019 \u201d  Bowling, our tour guide, opened by asking how many in our group of 12 had seen the miniseries. A flurry of hands went up, and he smiled. \u201cIt was about 60/40, with most of it being inaccurate,\u201d he said. There were inaccuracies on both sides, Bowling insisted, but he thought that the McCoys were treated especially unfairly, with Randall McCoy\u2019s cousin and attorney, Perry Cline, depicted as \u201cslimy\u201d and Randall portrayed as a drunkard. The History Channel also gave credit to the state tourism office in West Virginia but snubbed Kentucky, leading some in the Bluegrass State to wonder whether a conspiracy was afoot. \u201cIt was lopsided history, but it was great for reviving interest in the feud,\u201d Bowling said. \u201cNow it\u2019s given us a chance to tell the truth.\u201d Outside the courthouse, where eight Hatfields were tried and convicted of murdering two McCoys, Bowling told us that the bloodiest feud in the region was the Baker-Howard feud, which lasted for nearly 60 years and may have claimed more than 100 lives, compared with about a dozen fatalities over a 25-year span in the Hatfield-McCoy feud. Bowling thinks that the Hatfield-McCoy feud remains more famous because of the media attention it garnered after 1888, when the U.S. Supreme Court took up the question of whether members of the Hatfield clan could be tried in Kentucky after a posse arrested them in West Virginia and transported them across state lines. (Most of the McCoy clan lived on the Kentucky side, while the Hatfields lived in West Virginia; the court ruled 7-2 that the Hatfields could be tried in Kentucky, even though there\u2019d been no lawful extradition procedure.) Stops at the York Mansion, where Cline once lived, and the Dils Cemetery \u2014 the burial site for Randall; his wife, Sarah; and their daughter, Roseanna, who stirred up trouble by taking up with a member of the Hatfield clan \u2014 were mildly interesting, mostly because of the stories Bowling related in his folksy Appalachian accent. But the highlight of the tour was a stop at a little hilltop cemetery hidden up a steep road in a neighborhood just outside Pikeville, where Cline was buried after he died of tuberculosis in 1891. After the miniseries came out, Bowling told us, he and his colleagues had to learn more about Cline, who was featured as a prominent player in the feud.

Although the employee asked Harris to fill out an incident report, he assured Harris that it was just a formality and that he wouldn\u2019t get a bill for the damage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But six months later, Harris received a repair bill for $570. Among the charges was a $62 fee for \u201closs of use\u201d \u2014 a fee that Harris, a physician from Chicago, considers \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Some drivers agree. Rental companies used to write off the time a car spent in a garage as an expense. But shrinking profits forced them to add a loss-of-use charge to their repair bills, which allows them to recover the revenue they would have collected if the vehicle had been rented. \u201cCar rental companies were leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table by not collecting loss-of-use charges,\u201d says Neil Abrams, a car rental consultant. \u201cI think there\u2019s a recognition that there\u2019s a legitimate responsibility of the renter that extends beyond the rental of the vehicle.\u201d Although these fees have been around in one form or another for years, they were routinely dismissed when customers challenged them in the past. Not anymore. There\u2019s a limited legal precedent for collecting loss-of-use charges. The Colorado Supreme Court last year sided with PurCo Fleet Services in its seven-year battle to obtain loss-of-use fees from a customer who damaged her rental after colliding with a deer in Durango. The justices ruled that the company was \u201centitled to recover loss of use damages irrespective of its actual lost profits.\u201d The ruling applies only to car rentals in Colorado. But the issue is far from settled. At least three states \u2014 New York, California and Wisconsin \u2014 have laws that set limits on the amount that car rental companies can recover from loss of use on a damage claim. Avoiding a claim is the best way to steer clear of a loss-of-use charge, of course. In Harris\u2019s case, perhaps some damage was inevitable, because driving conditions on Maui are notoriously iffy. When you rent a car at the airport, you\u2019re given a stern warning to avoid driving on the island\u2019s unpaved roads. Car rental employees tend to be particularly vigilant about scratches and dings. If your car is damaged, you\u2019ll want to do what Harris did: He took snapshots of the scratches for his own records. You should also take pictures of your rental before you leave the lot to document the condition of your vehicle. If an employee assures you that you won\u2019t have to pay for the damage, it also helps to get the name of the agent, if not also a written statement to that effect. Even in the car rental industry, there\u2019s no consensus as to how a loss-of-use charge is calculated. At Enterprise, the largest car rental company, loss of use is based on the total number of labor hours from the repair estimate, divided by four, which the company says is a conservative estimate of labor hours that can be incorporated into each workday, and then multiplied by the daily rental rate. PurCo Fleet Services, a risk management company specializing in car rental loss prevention, calculates loss of use based on the number of days needed for repair, times the daily rate on the contract.   One issue that the car rental companies seem to agree on is the documentation needed to substantiate a claim: It\u2019s the actual number of days the vehicle was out of service or a good-faith estimate of the days needed for repair. Car rental companies believe that they aren\u2019t obliged to show evidence that the car would have been rented during that time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Appeals are difficult. While some rental companies have an informal review process, here\u2019s what usually happens: A customer\u2019s insurance company, insisting that it covers only actual damages, will reject part or all of the loss-of-use charge. The bill is then passed along to the customer, who may pay the fees or ask the company to reduce them. \u201cSettling a damage claim is nothing but a simple negotiation,\u201d says David Purinton, president of PurCo Fleet Services. \u201cRules for good-faith negotiations that apply in any type of negotiation apply here. The problem here is that most insurance companies and customers believe that, to be successful for them, a negotiation means they pay zero. Offering to pay zero for loss of use is not a negotiation.\u201d Of all the car rental fees, loss of use may prove to be the most problematic of all. That\u2019s because if the charges start to stick \u2014 if drivers accept that they should pay for a lost revenue opportunity \u2014 then it could open a Pandora\u2019s box. Not a day seems to go by when I\u2019m not asked why, for example, an airline can\u2019t compensate a passenger for a missed vacation day following a flight delay. If courts begin to agree with the car rental industry that customers are liable for missed potential rental days on a vehicle, then what\u2019s to stop a professional from billing a car rental company an hourly rate when there\u2019s a protracted wait time for a rental car? Harris never had a chance to get the answer to these questions. I contacted Hertz on his behalf, and separately he also asked Visa whether it would consider his claim, even though the deadline to file one had passed. Visa agreed to process his claim and paid $535, which covered part of Hertz\u2019s loss of use. \u201cIt\u2019s a happy resolution,\u201d he says. Unfortunately, too many of these cases end with a car rental company threatening to haul customers into court, report them to a credit agency, add them to a \u201cdo not rent\u201d list \u2014 or all three. \n E-mail Christopher Elliott at chris@elliott.org .", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Christopher Elliott", "wordCount": 966}, {"date": "2013-10-21 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Swimming with the whale sharks in Cancun", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32ba67f3/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cswimming0Ewith0Ethe0Ewhale0Esharks0Ein0Ecancun0C20A130C10A0C170C2ac40A6620E351b0E11e30E80Ac60E7e6dd8d22d8f0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "Our readers share tales of their rambles around the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n Who: Kris Gulden of Fairfax and her mother, Lana Turner, of Northumberland, Pa. \n\n Where, when, why: We went to Playa Mujeres, Mexico, just north of Cancun, Aug. 2-8. I wanted to do something special with my mom because she turned 70 in September, so we went to Mexico to swim with the whale sharks. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve wanted to do for many years, and as a 47-year-old paraplegic, I believe that my options for adventurous travel will become more and more limited as I get older. The time to do it seemed right for both of us. \n\n Highlights and high points: Being in the open ocean with all those whale sharks and manta rays was mind-blowing. It was nothing like the YouTube videos I\u2019d watched before we went \u2014 a single person swimming beside a solitary animal. There were whale sharks longer than the boat we were on, and they were everywhere. They nearly swam into us when we were in the water. We went scuba diving one day and took turns having our knuckles bitten by a 2-inch-long damselfish. Apparently, damsel\u00adfish can be very aggressive and territorial. One of the smallest fish in the sea posed more of a hazard than the biggest shark! \n\n Cultural connection or disconnect: We really liked one of our taxi drivers, Fernando, so we gave him a few bags of toothbrushes that Mom\u2019s dentist had donated. We knew that some of the poorer kids in Mexico have no awareness of the importance of oral hygiene, so we tried to make a difference by giving them toothbrushes. \n\n Biggest laugh or cry: One cabdriver was telling us a story about driving to Mexico City. I asked him how long it took to drive there, and he said, \u201cTwenty-two years. Driving, driving, driving. No stop for hungry, no stop for thirsty, just driving, driving, driving.\u201d I think he meant 22 hours, but he said 22 years. And the \u201cdriving, driving, driving\u201d \u2014 now we always use three verbs to describe what we\u2019re doing. For example, I am typing, typing, typing. \n\n How unexpected: We went scuba diving two days in Cancun. Cozumel has the reputation of being Mexico\u2019s best dive destination, but we saw larger fish and bigger schools of fish in Cancun than we had two years earlier in Cozumel. I was surprised that the diving in Cancun was as excellent as it was. \n\n Fondest memento or memory: I looked into the cavernous mouth of a hungry, 15-ton whale shark that was swimming at me.

Ozzie was not trying to escape the five-acre Chadds Ford, Pa., property for a better life in an SUV. He was just snuffling around for crumbs. \u201cHe likes Cheerios,\u201d said Rick, referring to the common detritus found in most family vehicles, including his own.  The Carros \u2014 Rick and his wife, Laura, their two daughters and two pets, Ozzie and Harriet the cat \u2014 took over the Fairville in 2007, becoming the fourth keepers of the Brandywine Valley inn since 1986. In earlier times, the region\u2019s monarchs, the DuPonts, occupied the 19th-century main house as a summer residence. The daffodil-yellow structure with the inky black shutters now contains five guest rooms, a curl-up den with a fireplace, and the dining room and kitchen, where Rick cooks breakfast and whips up such special-order desserts as chocolate truffle torte and fruit-stuffed crepes (no in-room flambes, reads the small print on the menu). An adjoining room holds the reception area and a corner gift shop selling pottery mugs, antiques (an 1880 china-head doll with \u201coriginal underwear\u201d goes for $135), fuzzy grass plumes from the garden and wool rugs woven by Rick-of-all-trades. Around back, the four-room Springhouse stands on the site of the former barn, which is gone but not entirely forgotten: reclaimed parts such as wooden beams and doors have returned as interior decor. I stayed in the six-room Carriage House, which resides on the same land as the former (and smaller) \u201cgarage.\u201d \n Each of the inn rooms is individually decorated, with some overlapping elements: gas fireplaces in eight rooms and cathedral ceilings in two. My room\u2019s key pieces included a princessy bed framed by floaty gossamer panels and a pair of cushy chairs for princes-in-waiting. I was the only guest who could claim an It. \u201cWe call the vine \u2018Cousin It,\u2019 \u201d said Rick, referring to the horticultural Afro sprouting from my back deck. \u201cWe give it a haircut every spring.\u201d My friend It blended in with the living Wyethian landscape of a cascading meadow, pervasive plantings and decorative and edible gardens. Rick is an adherent of the yard-to-table ethos, often incorporating his recent harvests into the morning dishes. Peppers, squash and tomatoes from his personal plot appear in omelets; melons land in the fruit salad; smoked and pureed pumpkins perk up pancakes and donuts. However, the black walnuts, so messy and tough to crack, remain unclaimed on the ground. When I arrived in the evening, the hotel was one bulb short of lights out. The front desk attendant issued a last call for ice, then led me to my room through the dark. I checked the stars from my porch (still twinkling), then kicked back on the snow-white bed, crawling to the edge for a better view of the very-small-screen TV. On weekdays, breakfast runs from 7 to 9 a.m. (weekends, 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.), and guests must sign up for a specific slot, which helps stagger the hot entree orders. As the last visitor to check in the night before, I\u2019d missed out on all the good (read: late-riser) spots. The solution: Below the last entry of 8:40, I scribbled in my name and 8:50. In hindsight, I should have added \u201cish.\u201d Guests were still scraping their plates when I wandered in. Laura, full of smiles, stopped at my table to refill my coffee. She inquired about my day\u2019s plan, throwing out such suggestions as visiting the nearby Longwood Gardens and the Wyeth artworks at the Brandywine River Museum. Crunched for time, I asked about the closer Fairville Gardens. \u201cThat\u2019s Rick\u2019s garden,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see him out there pruning and tending to his pumpkins.\u201d At that moment, Rick was on breakfast patrol, but once freed from the kitchen, he took me on a tour of the grounds. He pointed out the giant fir that wears ropes of colored lights during the holidays and the three-hole \u201cpitch-but-no-putt\u201d golf course (the fourth hole went a-missing). We also peeked at the suites and into my downstairs neighbor\u2019s accommodations, a fairy nymph\u2019s fantasy of forest-green-and-white floral wallpaper and a tall wooden headboard with a bow. Eventually, the chef/gardener/weaver/innkeeper had to return to his duties and I had to check out. But before driving off, I quickly glanced around my car to make sure that Ozzie wasn\u2019t in the back seat, vacuuming up the cereal bits. \n\n Fairville Inn \n\n 506 Kennett Pike Chadds Ford, Pa. 610-388-5900 \n\n www.fairvilleinn.com \n\n \n\n \n Rooms from $175 a night.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Andrea Sachs", "wordCount": 841}, {"date": "2013-10-17 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Funny signs from the world of travel", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/32979b90/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cfunny0Esigns0Efrom0Ethe0Eworld0Eof0Etravel0C20A130C10A0C170C7ee50Ad0A60E36a40E11e30E8a0Ae0E4e2cf80A831fc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "Bob Atkins of McGaheysville, Va., came across this warning on a beach in Hilo, Hawaii, in August.

It drained visitors from popular attractions, causing hotel occupancy rates to plummet and hurting other travel-related businesses. Along the way, many travelers have discovered the important \u2014 and often underappreciated \u2014 part that the federal government plays in travel. Without the government, they learned, some of the most interesting parts of the travel industry simply wouldn\u2019t exist. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t been as aware of the government\u2019s role in travel,\u201d says Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute. On paper, the shutdown didn\u2019t look like much, at least from a travel point of view. Both federal Transportation Security Administration screeners and air traffic controllers remained on the job. America\u2019s embassies and consulates stayed open, and passport applications were still being processed. But in practice, it turned out to be a significant event. Travelers were unprepared for the closing of America\u2019s 401 national parks, which included all monuments along the \n Mall, the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. \u201cPeople wanted to know, \u2018What does any of this have to do with the issues in Washington?\u2019 \u201d says John Reynolds, a former deputy director of the National Park Service. \u201cThe answer is: \u2018It has absolutely nothing to do with it.\u2019 They were absolutely appalled.\u201d Count Kristy Michael among them. She was camping in Grand Teton National Park on Oct. 2 when a park ranger at Gros Ventre Campground ordered her and her husband to pack up their Airstream and leave the facility within 48 hours, a day earlier than planned. \u201cOur original plan was to head south from Grand Teton and visit Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks in southern Utah,\u201d she adds. \u201cOf course, with the shutdown that won\u2019t be happening.\u201d This is possibly the worst time of year to close a national park, particularly in the Western United States. \u201cBecause temperatures here in the desert are starting to cool down, this time of year is incredibly important to us,\u201d says Robert Richardson, who runs a recreational gear review site in Las Vegas. \u201cTo have these parks close during the peak of the season is devastating to our tourism industry.\u201d Making matters worse, the National Park Service has threatened anyone entering any of the national parks or national wildlife refuges with a $5,000 fine and jail time of up to six months, an action that Richardson called \u201cabsurd.\u201d As of Oct. 7, 21 people have reportedly been issued citations for entering Grand Canyon National Park. The effects are also being felt closer to the capital, where many of the city\u2019s popular museums went dark. Marcy Schackne, a vice president for a luggage company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., had plans to fly to Washington later this month for a wedding but has already canceled her museum visits. \u201cNothing is open,\u201d she said. The happy couple was planning to get hitched in the District, but Schackne fears that the closings could force them to change their wedding plans, too.   Across the Potomac in Arlington, the combined effects of a slump in tourism and canceled trips related to the government shutdown has resulted in up to a 50 percent drop in hotel revenue, according to Cara O\u2019Donnell, a spokeswoman for Arlington Economic Development. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of meetings of government business and contractor events that are being canceled, school groups and leisure travel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really hurting us.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Travelers, meanwhile, are quick to blame their travel problems on the shutdown, even when the connection is tenuous at best. Don Fairley, a retired marketing executive from Long Beach, Calif., says that he endured a 1\u00bd-hour wait at customs in Houston after flying in from Frankfurt, Germany. \u201cIt was a total mess,\u201d he says. Helene Ward and her husband were returning to Washington Dulles International Airport from Athens on Oct. 2 when they were met with \u201cinordinately long lines\u201d at customs. Ward believes that their two-hour delay was a direct result of the shutdown, even though customs officers aren\u2019t supposed to be affected by the furloughs. \u201cThere was only one customs officer,\u201d she remembers. \u201cIt was bad enough for Americans to see how dysfunctional our government is, but shameful for foreigners to see us at our worst.\u201d While these problems, both real and imagined, may pale in comparison with the disaster that some predict will occur if the U.S. government defaults on its debt \u2014 a possible result of the legislative brinksmanship \u2014 I can\u2019t help adding my own tale of woe. I\u2019m scheduled to start a three-week tour of America\u2019s Western national parks, including Yellowstone and Grand Teton, on Monday. Even if all the parks reopen, Reynolds says that it will take weeks for them to be fully up and running smoothly. I don\u2019t know how to break it to my kids, ages 6, 8 and 11. Maybe I should start by telling them a little bit about how our government works \u2014 or doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s no substitute for a closed museum or park. You can\u2019t replace a visit to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, because there\u2019s nothing on Earth like it. Thanks to the closings, our trip, and many others, could end in disappointment. Perhaps the only real solution is to let Congress know how unhappy you are about your foiled travel plans. An e-mail or phone call would do the trick, but experts agree that the best opportunity to express your disapproval may be at the ballot box. \n E-mail Christopher Elliott at chris@elliott.org .", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Christopher Elliott", "wordCount": 951}, {"date": "2013-10-12 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In Linz, Austria, searching for the perfect Linzer torte, the pastry of her childhood", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636610/s/324f7a67/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Ctravel0Cin0Elinz0Eaustria0Esearching0Efor0Ethe0Eperfect0Elinzer0Etorte0Ethe0Epastry0Eof0Eher0Echildhood0C20A130C10A0C10A0C5db62920A0E22460E11e30E966c0E9c4293c47ebe0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Itravel/story01.htm", "text": "When I heard that a new opera house was opening in the Austrian city of Linz, the news should have spurred lyrical memories of Mozart\u2019s Linz Symphony or the thundering notes of Anton Bruckner, who grew up nearby. Instead, I suddenly tasted the finely ground hazelnuts mixed with lemon-infused spices that made up my favorite childhood pastry: the Linzer torte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n Details: Linz \n\n Growing up in Geneva, I spent most Tuesday afternoons enduring a painful piano lesson. But after each one, my Parisian mother, well aware of my growing obsession with sweets, would take me across the street to the corner pastry shop, where she let me pick out a treat from among as many as 20 cakes. Every time, I chose the Linzer torte, a pastry filled with raspberry or currant jam and topped with a lattice crust. I can still taste the crumbly, buttery dough and the pungent jam, and recall the way my one-on-one with composer Carl Czerny would recede from my consciousness and melt into pure pleasure. Now settled in New York, I\u2019d leveraged my sensitive palate into a busy career as a food and travel writer. I decided to travel to Austria and, channeling Gretel, follow a path of torte crumbs around Linz and into its new opera house. Since 2009, when it was named a European Capital of Culture, the small city that straddles the Danube between Vienna and Salzburg has made tremendous strides in shedding its stark industrial reputation in favor of a quasi-futuristic modern image. \u201cFirst we cleaned the air,\u201d said Horst H\u00f6rtner, senior director of Futurelab, an innovation think tank at Ars Electronica, a digital media and technology museum housed in a striking multicolored, LED-lit glass cube on the river. \u201cThen we cleaned the water, created a car-free zone and gave the town a facelift.\u201d And last year, his crew also invented a microchip that translates sound into light. \u201cAs a wink to our culinary heritage, we painted it red and called it Linzer Schnitte [meaning slice],\u201d he added. I was onto something. \n Sweet origins \n I cross the Nibelungen Bridge, headed back to the past and the city\u2019s old town. \u201cIt suddenly dawned on me that the Linzer torte connects much of our history,\u201d said Ute Sailer, a city guide who recently came up with a \u201cLinzer Torte Tour.\u201d We\u2019re standing on the Hauptplatz, the main square, lined with pastel baroque facades. \u201cThere\u2019s been a weekly market here for the last 800 years,\u201d Ute adds casually. She leads me on the short walk to k.u.k. Hofb\u00e4ckerei, the oldest bakery in town. It\u2019s helmed by fifth-generation baker Fritz Rath, a favorite of expat Dennis Russell Davies, music director and chief conductor of the Linz Opera and the Bruckner Orchestra Linz. \u201cNo! We don\u2019t put no raspberry jam in the torte,\u201d roars Rath, a genial goblin who seems to have sprung straight out of a box, in charmingly ungrammatical English. He bounces back to his kitchen, gesturing for me to follow and don an apron. I dig my hands into the dough as he guides me through the making of my very own torte. I can\u2019t resist licking a spoonful of red currant jam. \u201cHere in Upper Austria,\u201d explains the baker, \u201cred currants grow everywhere, like weeds.\u201d  \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t While the torte bakes, I chat with Liselotte Schlager, author of a cultural history of the pastry, in the nostalgic cafe plastered with memorabilia from the heyday of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the oldest pastry recipes ever recorded,\u201d she affirms. But from what year? Historians and bakers bicker over 1653 vs. 1696. But they all seem to agree that the ancient manuscript was discovered in the stunning baroque library of the Admont Abbey, about 50 miles away in the Austrian Alps, which houses more than 200,000 volumes dating from as early as the 8th century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t My Linzer torte is ready. I nibble slowly, layer by layer: the slivered, fragile almonds on top; the golden lattice; the sweet and sour notes of the jam; and then the moist hazelnut dough redolent of cinnamon and clove. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that in the 1600s, only the elite could afford spices or almonds,\u201d remarks Ute, my diligent guide. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Later, she leads me to the Linz-Genesis Museum where, among Roman artifacts and tools from the Middle Ages, sit Linzer torte boxes from the early 1900s. They\u2019re way past their sell-by dates, but their covers feature images of the \u201cSch\u00f6ne Linzerin,\u201d the plump feminine ideal of the time. Later that night, I\u2019ll learn that in today\u2019s local slang, a hot chick is referred to as, what else \u2014 a Linzer Schnitte! \n A night at the opera \n On my way to the \u201cnew\u201d cathedral, a dark neo-Gothic ship dating from the mid-19th century (the \u201cold\u201d one, where Bruckner served as organist between 1855 and 1868, was completed in the 17th century), I spot Gragger, a grungy shop featuring breads, cakes and an \u201call organic\u201d sign. The dark breads are fabulous, but alas, their torte is dry. In the evening, I shun the tramway and walk the whole length of Landstrasse, the main artery that leads to the sturdy steel-and-stone Opera House. The new building, imagined by British architect Terry Pawson, cost $236 million and has breathed new currents of life into the whole neighborhood. It\u2019s operetta night, and the full house settles in, under a circle of lights reminiscent of Carnegie Hall. No offense to Offenbach and \u201cLa Vie Parisienne,\u201d but I soon slip out of my seat and climb the two flights of stairs to Das Anton, the gleaming open-kitchen brasserie, where celebrity chef Toni M\u00f6rwald offers Austrian cuisine with a modern bent. \u201cSo is the restaurant named for you?\u201d I ask innocently as the chef and I sit beneath a severe portrait of Bruckner. \u201cOf course!\u201d he trumpets. \u201cWell, for me, and Bruckner.\u201d M\u00f6rwald has reimagined the Linzer torte as a vanilla parfait sprinkled with almonds, holding court beside a sphere of nutty dough that we\u2019re expected to dip, lollipop-style, into a red currant compote. Delicious and clever. The next day, the whole town is out to cheer the runners in the annual citywide marathon. On the Danube, now a clean blue, a fast boat pulls a water-skier. The waves are reflected in the glass facade of the Lentos Art Museum, where several Warhols, Klimts and Schieles hang. Some say that the nearby Brucknerhaus, a circular 1974 concert hall, was built in the shape of a Linzer torte. Perhaps it was. \n\t\t\t\t  On a quiet cobblestone square, a group of American women are enjoying drinks. They\u2019re in Austria teaching English, and they laugh hysterically upon hearing what has brought me here. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cLinzer torte, it\u2019s like a coffee cake,\u201d says Celeste Maus. \u201cKinda dry.\u201d But they insist that I check out Cafe Jindrak, where the official torte can supposedly be found. \n Past and present \n There are six outposts of the cafe in town, so I choose the closest one, just off the elegant Rudigierstrasse and its antiques and design galleries. But in the window of a concept store named Daschkaria, a postcard calls my name. Photographed by the co-owner, Daniela K\u00f6ppl, it shows crumbs of Linzer torte and a fork on a paper plate. The card says simply: Once upon a time, there was a Linzer torte. \u201cI thought it illustrated our town very well,\u201d K\u00f6ppl says. But I\u2019m after more than crumbs, so I proceed to Jindrak\u2019s bakery. Talk about \u201cofficial\u201d! Leo Jindrak III is the only baker allowed to feature the Linz coat of arms on his boxes, an honor bestowed by the mayor in the 1970s. Jindrak is also famous for holding the record for the largest Linzer torte ever baked, with a diameter of 13 feet. How will this cake compare with my own, fresh out of the oven? I take a bite, a bit dubious, but the pastry is fabulous, with a clear hazelnut kick. \u201cBut hazelnuts only appeared in the recipe at the end of the 19th century,\u201d says librarian Waltraud Feissner, who, like the Empress Elizabeth before her, has collected dozens of recipes. \u201cYou know, every baker claims to have the original recipe, but I know they don\u2019t. I counted as many as 80 original recipes!\u201d Next I visit Peter Hirsch, culinary writer for the local newspaper Ober\u00f6sterreichische Nachrichten. \u201cHave you been to Verdi\u2019s?\u201d he asks. \u201cErich Lukas, the fabulous chef, makes a torte in a glass.\u201d The next night, I hire a cab to drive me five miles outside town to Lukas\u2019s charming chalet. Both Einkehr, the casual cafe there, and the gastro enclave, Verdi, are teeming with seemingly happy diners. The torte in a glass turns out to be the Viennese Sachertorte, but from the bucolic terrace, I take my measure of Linz, spreading in the distance. Suddenly I understand what\u2019s happening here. For centuries, the history of the town and the history of its native torte have followed a parallel path. But now, Linz offers both scrumptious bites of its baroque past and glimpses of its ultra-modern present, in the shape of a lollipop or inside a glass building. It\u2019s a great combo. \n Bigar is a food and travel writer in New York.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "travel"], "author": "Sylvie Bigar", "wordCount": 1512}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Book excerpt: Dan Morse\u2019s \u2018The Yoga Store Murder\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/334d6740/sc/15/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cstyle0Cbook0Eexcerpt0Edan0Emorses0Ethe0Eyoga0Estore0Emurder0C20A130C110C0A40Cdb68c80A80E430A40E11e30E8b740Ed89d714ca4dd0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "Excerpt adapted from the \u201cThe Yoga Store Murder.\u201d \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The sounds reached Jana Svrzo as she walked across the sales floor of the Apple Store, now closed for the night. Jana was 29 years old and wore funky black sneakers and a ready smile \u2014 an easy fit among Apple\u2019s hip, young sales army. It was just after 10 p.m. on Friday, March 11, 2011, in downtown Bethesda, and Jana, the store\u2019s manager, had about an hour\u2019s worth of record-keeping ahead of her, following the opening day sales for Apple\u2019s hot new product, the iPad 2. Now, though, she looked to her right and listened. The sounds were high-pitched yelps and squeals, and low-pitched grunts, thuds, a dragging noise, as if something heavy was being moved. Jana thought they might be coming from a room near the back exit or a room upstairs, where technicians were still on duty. She asked a security guard to help her search. Jana and the guard split up, meeting two minutes later upstairs, where they spoke to another young manager, Ricardo Rios. \u201cScreaming,\u201d the guard said. \u201cIt sounded like some lady was screaming.\u201d They checked out the technicians\u2019 room. All clear. They walked downstairs to the sales floor and heard more yelling. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from next door,\u201d Jana said \u2014 from Lululemon Athletica, the luxury yoga store with which Apple shared a wall. She and Ricardo walked closer to the wall. Jana now could hear someone saying: \u201cTalk to me. Don\u2019t do this. Talk to me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Then she heard what sounded like a different voice, maybe the one that had just been screaming. Now it was quieter: \u201cGod help me. Please help me.\u201d \u201cMaybe I should just call the cops,\u201d Jana said. \u201cThat\u2019s up to you,\u201d Ricardo answered. He told Jana it sounded as if one person had just heard tragic news and the other was trying to get her to talk about it. \u201cI think it\u2019s just drama.\u201d Ricardo went back upstairs. It was 10:19 p.m., eight minutes after Jana had first heard the noises. Wilbert Hawkins, a second security guard, had been observing the commotion. The crashing sounds, he figured, could have been a merchandise display falling over, the yelling some kind of horsing around. He and Jana and Ricardo came to the same view: This was Bethesda; surely the noises were something explainable. They could see pedestrians walking around and nearby restaurants that were still open. People\u2019s instincts often work against them in such situations. The more people there are around, they assume, the more likely it is that someone will call \u2014 or has already called \u2014 for help if there really is a need. Jana went upstairs and for the next half hour, she and Ricardo added up receipts for the day. Ricardo left at 10:56 p.m. Jana finished 10 minutes later, and walked out as well. The next morning, 26-year-old Ryan Haugh walked up to the Apple Store. He\u2019d tried to buy an iPad 2 the night before and waited in the long line outside for more than two hours, but the tablets were sold out by the time he got to the door. Ryan didn\u2019t want to make the same mistake again, so he\u2019d thrown on jeans and a bright red Philadelphia Phillies baseball cap and dashed out of his home that morning without a shower.   It was now 7:45 a.m., more than two hours before the store would open. No other customers had yet arrived, so Ryan took a seat on a teak bench near the Apple Store. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Shortly after 8 a.m., he saw a woman approach, her orange running shoes bright against the gray morning, and go into the store next to Apple, clearly an employee about to start her day. Moments later, Ryan heard a voice. \u201cHello? Hello?!\u201d There was an edge to it. The woman in the orange shoes came back out and was talking on her phone. \u201cI hear someone moaning in the back,\u201d she was saying, \u201cand it looks like it\u2019s been vandalized and I\u2019m just really scared to go in.\u201d To Ryan it was clear she had called 911. She answered a few more questions, giving her name, Rachel. She ended the call and turned toward Ryan. \u201cHave you seen anyone go in or out of this store this morning?\u201d she asked. No, Ryan said. \u201cDo you want me to go in?\u201d \u201cWould you mind?\u201d Ryan had never been inside a Lululemon shop. He thought it looked like a Gap, with lots of low racks and tables full of bright-colored clothes. He walked to the back as Rachel waited up front. \u201cAnybody here?\u201d Ryan called out. No response. On the floor, Ryan saw scattered blood stains, which grew more concentrated as he advanced to a back corner. He noticed even more blood at the base of a purple door, as if it had seeped from the other side. He gently pushed the door. It stopped, hitting the side of a body. Ryan saw a pair of legs extending from a body facedown surrounded by more blood. He reached down. No movement. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody back here!\u201d he shouted back to Rachel. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re dead!\u201d He headed back toward the front of the store, for the first time noticing two bathrooms to his right. Their doors were both open, and he saw another pair of legs, bound at the ankles and extending from one of the doorways. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody else in here!\u201d Ryan called out. He approached the second woman, noting that her hands were bound over her head, and her face was bloody. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked. She moaned, barely. Rachel rushed outside and called 911 again. Seconds later a police car zoomed down Bethesda Avenue, stopping in front of the crowd. The officer jumped out and told the crowd to get back; she drew her gun and went into the store. Then, silence. No shots. No screams. More cops arrived and rushed in, then paramedics, who rolled a stretcher into the store. Minutes later, they wheeled it out. There was a woman on top, covered in a blanket, writhing in pain. The customers could see blood on her face. \u201cIs she going to make it?\u201d one of them asked. \n The author will discuss the book on Thursday, Nov. 7, at 7 p.m., at the Barnes & Noble in downtown Bethesda. Two jurors from the Lululemon trial will also be available to take questions. \n \n\n \n Adapted from \u201cThe Yoga Store Murder\u201d by Dan Morse.

The 39-year-old song\u00adwriter co-wrote Miranda Lambert\u2019s punchy \u201c Mama\u2019s Broken Heart \u201d and Kacey Musgraves\u2019s paralyzing \u201c Merry Go \u2019Round ,\u201d making him the only guy on the block with two nominations for song of the year. This stretch of Music Row \u2014 a storied songwriting salt mine that looks like any old leafy residential boulevard in town \u2014 is quiet on Sunday afternoon. But this neighborhood is still entrenched in a conflict that\u2019s been raging for generations \u2014 the war between real country music and the commercial stuff. McAnally\u2019s songs are brilliantly, unabashedly both. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a commercial-minded songwriter. I\u2019m here to make a living and be on the radio. But radio is still really dominated by something else,\u201d he says. \u201cI just think there\u2019s more. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019d like for the top 20 songs to not only be that .\u201d He\u2019s talking about the feel-great party anthems that have dominated the charts this year \u2014 songs where the beers are always frosty, the trucks are always muddy, everyone is 19 and the singer is always a dude. McAnally isn\u2019t trying to shut down the party with his ballads about longing, vulnerability and bad-idea booty calls \u2014 he just wants to coexist. And having co-written seven No. 1 country singles in the past three years, he is. He didn\u2019t do it alone. Rising alongside a tight clique of co-writers \u2014 including Brandy Clark, who released her stunning solo debut last month \u2014 McAnally has helped write monster hits ( Lady Antebellum \u2019s \u201c Downtown ,\u201d the Band Perry \u2019s \u201c Better Dig Two \u201d) and superlative sleeper cuts ( Ashley Monroe \u2019s \u201c Two Weeks Late ,\u201d Randy Rogers Band \u2019s \u201c Fuzzy \u201d) \u2014 all very different songs with varying degrees of bittersweetness. \u201cThat internal ache is the starting point of country music,\u201d McAnally says. \u201cIf it\u2019s a happy song and I can still feel sad in it? That\u2019s my favorite. Pop does that a lot right now. Both of Miley Cyrus\u2019s singles, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d and \u201cWrecking Ball.\u201d [Katy Perry\u2019s] \u201cTeenage Dream.\u201d .\u2009.\u2009. Those songs are sad to me, even though they\u2019re, like, UNGH-UNGH-UNGH!\u201d (He pumps his fist overhead like Arsenio Hall.) McAnally is sharp-witted, shrewd, smart. Just the right amount of cocky. He\u2019s also gay and out, but feels that the reductive \u201cgay country songwriter\u201d tag that\u2019s been pinned to his lapel says more about the media\u2019s perception of Nashville than it does about him.

Now you\u2019re here and the only thing you can do is out-write everybody else,\u2019\u2009\u201d McAnally says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t McAnally grew up in Mineral Wells, Tex., and spent his childhood devouring country radio and MTV. \u201cI always loved the shiniest, most popular thing,\u201d McAnally says. \u201cI always loved Willie Nelson, but I loved the songs that Willie made famous.\u201d He came to Nashville in 1994 with dreams of superstardom, but after his 2000 debut album went thud, he moved to Los Angeles and eventually boomeranged back to the country music capital in 2007, out and ready to write. Nashville felt claustrophobic his first time around. Not anymore. \u201cWhen I lived here in \u201994, I wasn\u2019t even out to me, and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to figure that out here, being a country music singer,\u201d McAnally says. \u201cNow, things are different. But maybe I\u2019m different. I don\u2019t know why I was so closeted. I grew up in a small town in Texas. I had the hangover from that. It wasn\u2019t Nashville. I haven\u2019t felt anything but accepted here. And the success helps. Because what are they gonna say?\u201d That success came quickly, in country music years. No other form of pop has a slower metabolism \u2014 and McAnally\u2019s fast-but-slow ascent is strong evidence of that. He says it takes roughly two years for a song to travel from his guitar to the radio. During that time, publishers shop the song around town. An artist puts it on layaway. Maybe they get around to recording it. Or maybe they bail and the process starts over. The music moves slowly and change can feel glacial. But it\u2019s happening. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d McAnally says of country music\u2019s future. \u201cHow could I complain? I have had so much critical praise with what I\u2019ve worked on. I\u2019ve gotten on the radio, and so many people that get critical praise don\u2019t.\u201d The biggest hurdle McAnally faces now is his own happiness. He and his husband \u2014 the two got married in Mexico in September 2012 \u2014 are busy raising their two young children, a daughter and a son. Last year, he was writing a staggering eight songs every week, meaning those plaques will keep showing up at the office. Life\u2019s brooding dramas feel very far away. \u201cI have a hard time being happy, and I think a lot of creative people suffer with that when life gets real happy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m affected by things that are really sad and I\u2019m just not very sad right now. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m a creative person who had a lot of dark time in my life. I can still get to it, I can still go to a relationship or a time when things weren\u2019t great. But it\u2019s getting further and further from me. So what choice should I make? I really like being happy.\u201d Maybe he could try transposing all that domestic bliss into melody? \u201cWrite a song about my kids right now?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019d rather just hang out with them.\u201d \n In Wednesday\u2019s Washington Post: Brandy Clark is one of country music\u2019s most talked-about new artists.

There\u2019s only so long you can convincingly rage against the machine, when your rage is what fuels it. This moment is where we find Eminem and M.I.A. , each with a new album \u2014 his \u201c The Marshall Mathers LP 2 ,\u201d hers \u201c Matangi \u201d \u2014 and engaged in alternate versions of \u201c This Is 40 .\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The barbarians have become brands capable of altering corporate bottom lines. Eminem has hawked oceans of Brisk Iced Tea, fleets of Chryslers and more records than any living rapper. An Oscar gleams on the 41-year old\u2019s mantel in his Kmart mansion in suburban Detroit. Mathangi \u201cMaya\u201d Arulpragasam, 38, has similarly turned cultural sedition into immense success. The daughter of a revolutionary displaced by the Sri Lankan civil war has her own Versace line. Her young son is a scion to the Seagram\u2019s liquor fortune.  Eminem may shout out his underground bona fides on the new album\u2019s \u201cLegacy,\u201d but he\u2019s as responsible as anyone for the mainstreaming of hip-hop. The first \u201c Marshall Mathers LP \u201d transcended genre. It was wincingly profane, emotionally unnerving and captured the millennial zeitgeist. As Eminem put it: The underground spun around and did a 360. You could use the same phrase to describe M.I.A. flipping off 111 million viewers during the 2012 Super Bowl halftime show . The act earned her a $1.5 million lawsuit from the NFL. A response comes on \u201cMatangi\u2019s\u201d \u201cBoom Skit,\u201d in which she assails those angry that she tried to \u201csteal Madonna\u2019s crown.\u201d Her politics are muddled, but the message is clear: neither truffle fries nor television time mitigate her desire to savage those \u201cwho don\u2019t get our underground.\u201d Eminem\u2019s definition of \u201cunderground\u201d specifically referred to a schism in hip-hop culture; M.I.A.\u2019s encompasses the global disenfranchised. The first \u201c Marshall Mathers LP \u201d became a touchstone because Eminem spoke for the millions who dressed, walked and talked like him. \u201cMatangi\u201d implicitly reproaches that same fair-haired, light-eyed majority \u2014 or anyone reaping the dividends of economic inequality. While their creative differences might be stark, both spend much of their latest records exploring what\u2019s left to rebel against. M.I.A.\u2019s fourth album is a dialectic disguised as a dance party. In interviews given last year, she blamed delays on record label executives dismayed at her shift towards positivity. Still, there\u2019s plenty of vitriol aimed at multinational oligarchs, government surveillance and those \u201cwhose guns point the wrong way.\u201d \u201cATENTion\u201d spotlights the plight of dispossessed refugees, complete with an uncredited writing assist from WikiLeaks founder and M.I.A. comrade Julian Assange. There\u2019s \u201cBring the Noize,\u201d which takes its name from Public Enemy, and rants against banks, bad tattoos and how she\u2019s the \u201coverweight, heavyweight, female Slick Rick.\u201d But \u201cMatangi\u201d also doubles as an exploration of metaphysical and carnal concerns. Its title comes from the Hindu tantric goddess of speech, music and knowledge. There are two songs with the lecherous crooner the Weeknd . The opener is \u201cKarmaggedon,\u201d which reconciles her sky-is-falling past with a nascent desire for inner peace.   Even at her most mellow, M.I.A. remains a pop subversive. Whether you buy into the quasi-revolutionary rhetoric or not, she resists initiation into the realm of top 40 clich\u00e9. There are no melodramatic ballads, cynical radio grabs or cameos from the hot rapper du jour. \u201cMatangi\u201d is a pan-global, post-Internet tantrum of bhangra beats, hip-hop, Bollywood music, dancehall, EDM and the occasional jazz harp. While it can get tedious, it finds M.I.A. refining her sound and self-identity. It\u2019s engaging but still keeps you at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s club music for those who can\u2019t countenance (or afford) the bottle-service scam. The influences are acknowledged without nostalgia. What\u2019s left to rebel against is converted into a multimedia art experiment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Eminem\u2019s aims are comparatively vague. \u201cI\u2019m all out of Backstreet Boys to attack,\u201d he laments on \u201cEvil Twin,\u201d a rare highlight from \u201cMMLP2.\u201d The semi-sequel finds him at a crossroads, scanning the horizon of broken-up boy bands and faded pop stars he once reviled. \u201cWho\u2019s left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber? Nah,\u201d he continues.  It\u2019s an honest admission that the war is over. Yet much of the album ironically finds him lobbing stale and dated pop culture salvos towards a world where CNN brings next-day analysis of Miley Cyrus twerking. He\u2019s the last one making jokes about Kevin Federline, Lorena Bobbitt and O.J. Simpson. On the first \u201cMarshall Mathers LP,\u201d Eminem used his whiteness to incisively examine deeper racial hypocrisies. Its successor finds him adrift in a world where the other most popular white rapper advocates for same-sex marriage and grandpa sweaters. The same homophobic slurs, mommy issues and violent threats toward women remain. But whereas Eminem once used them in service of jokes and cohesive narratives, he now uses them as a trigger for nostalgia. The Rick Rubin-produced lead single \u201cBerzerk\u201d intimated that \u201cMMLP2\u201d would be Eminem\u2019s throwback album, but Rubin\u2019s contributions seem to mostly comprise exhuming old Zombies and Joe Walsh loops over which Eminem can express his confusion about Facebook and Internet downloading. Eminem\u2019s syllable manipulation and rhyming agility remain staggering. But success has validated his worst musical decisions and Sam\u2019s Club tastes. Kendrick Lamar is the album\u2019s lone hip-hop guest, and the dream collaboration is squandered on awkward sex jokes on \u201cLove Game.\u201d The beat for \u201cRap God\u201d sounds made for a rave in a straight-to-DVD vampire movie. If \u201cSurvival\u201d feels made to cross-promote a video game for hyper-violent adolescents, that\u2019s because it was (\u201cCall of Duty: Ghosts\u201d). The album opens with a seven-minute plus sequel to \u201cStan\u201d; it replaces the original\u2019s psychological unraveling with sub-\u201cSaw\u201d schlock. Nate Ruess of fun., Skyler Gray and Rihanna pop up elsewhere to belt Eminem\u2019s hokey, group-therapy choruses. The Dr. Dre beats are gone, substituted with monotonous martial drums and squealing rock-rap guitars for the Nickelback demographic. Since \u201cLose Yourself,\u201d Eminem has increasingly incorporated atonal, nasally hooks and grumpy-dad growls. But they lack build and pacing \u2014 crescendos come as randomly as a mad dog barking at a ghost. He mistakes architectural complexity for advancement. The raps are technical metal guitar solos that go nowhere. The flows are dazzling but lack the elasticity and playful wit of Eminem\u2019s early brilliance. \n\n Albert Camus described a rebel as a \u201cman who says no.\u201d \u201cMMLP2\u201d is the sound of Eminem saying yes. In 2000, he was the monster. In 2013, he\u2019s \u201cfriends with the monsters under his bed.\u201d Marshall Mathers may still command a nation of millions, but he\u2019s lost the ability to see their faces. \n Weiss is a freelance writer.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Jeff Weiss", "wordCount": 1073}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "TV highlights: Coach is back on \u2018New Girl\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/334c82d1/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctv0Ctv0Ehighlights0Ecoach0Eis0Eback0Eon0Enew0Egirl0C20A130C110C0A40Cd59c57a40E43320E11e30E8b740Ed89d714ca4dd0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "The group conducts a telling seance on \u201cRavenswood\u201d (ABC Family at 8 p.m.) to disprove Luke\u2019s doubts that their town is possessed by an evil spirit.

To the general public, Britten, who would have been 100 this month, needs more special pleading than the other two, both born a century before him. He seems generally underappreciated, despite the fact that he knows how to write for the voice; he knows how to write for instruments; and there are a lot of stunning pieces in his oeuvre. I\u2019ve often written about how much I love his work. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t And to many people, even those who aren\u2019t particular Britten fans, his \u201cWar Requiem\u201d \u2014 which the Washington Chorus gave at the Kennedy Center in a strong and moving performance Sunday night \u2014 is one of his masterpieces. To me, it represents a stumbling block.  I don\u2019t want to let personal bias pollute my account of a powerful evening. \u201cWar Requiem\u201d is a big piece, with full orchestra and chamber orchestra (drawn heavily from the National Symphony Orchestra\u2019s ranks), full chorus, three vocal soloists and a children\u2019s chorus and organ (the Washington Children\u2019s Chorus was enthroned in a balcony at the back of the hall, the singers\u2019 voices radiating down over the audience like boisterous angels). When the piece came to its aching conclusion and Julian Wachner, the chorus\u2019s director, put down his arms, the hall was wrapped in a sustained silence. It seemed to me less the silence of people trying to be properly rapt and more the silence of people who needed to finish digesting what they\u2019d heard before descending to the level of applause. Wachner is midway through a festival of all of Britten\u2019s nonoperatic work this fall at New York\u2019s Trinity Church, his other artistic home, so Britten at this point is home turf. Wachner led fluidly, linking all the disparate parts into a kind of homogenous whole: There was not a lot of contrast between the chamber-orchestra sections, which accompany the male vocal soloists singing poems by Wilfred Owen, and the full-orchestra sections during which the chorus and soprano sing the Latin text of the standard Requiem Mass. The orchestra surged up around the soloists, particularly the soprano, Jessica Muirhead: The decision to cast this part with a lighter voice paid off at moments, like the \u201cLacrimosa,\u201d but made some rough going for her in the \u201cLiber scriptus.\u201d The soprano in this piece also has a tougher job in that she represents a faceless female voice, as opposed to the precise characterizations of the Owen poems sung by the men. The baritone Christopher Burchett was perfectly capable without being incisive \u2014 in, for example, the opening of the poem in the Offertorium, \u201cSo Abram rose,\u201d which lacked the vivid emphasis the passage seems to call for. The standout was the tenor, Vale Rideout, who joined emotional expression with intense singing. Although you might say the beautifully prepared children\u2019s chorus was the standout, since it literally stood so far apart from the rest of the proceedings. And the Washington Chorus itself offered a warm, textured sound, dwindling to a bare hum at some of the iterations of \u201crequiem,\u201d grant them peace. Wachner could have been more incisive in his conducting and helped bring out the soloists more, but what he offered was on a level that showed once again that he is a full-blown conductor who happens to conduct choruses, rather than that tricky appellation, a \u201cchoral conductor.\u201d That he didn\u2019t wholly convert me is no one\u2019s fault but my own. Often, a review can serve as a way for a critic to advance her argument about a piece, but I don\u2019t especially want to advance my feelings about \u201cWar Requiem\u201d; I wish I liked it more than I do. It is full of beautiful moments, and I am always surprised, returning to it, to remember how well I know it. But as an experience, it always seems fragmentary, filled with bits that remind me happily of other Britten moments I love \u2014 skittering horns, children singing in headlong chant, a phrase emerging from one of the poems in the baritone\u2019s firm voice. Personal tastes are essential to a critic\u2019s job, but it\u2019s unfortunate when they keep one from joining in, for example, Sunday\u2019s enthusiastic, and deserved, applause. \n The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra will also perform \u201cWar Requiem\u201d on Nov. 14 and 15 in Baltimore and on Nov. 16 at Strathmore.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Anne Midgette", "wordCount": 745}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Theater review: \u2018I Am My Own Wife\u2019 at Rep Stage", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/334a2fb7/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Ctheater0Idance0Ctheater0Ereview0Ei0Eam0Emy0Eown0Ewife0Eat0Erep0Estage0C20A130C110C0A40C24c5d60Ae0E455c0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "Doug Wright\u2019s \u201cI Am My Own Wife\u201d premiered in New York in 2003, appeared at the National Theatre in 2005, was produced by the Olney Theatre Center in 2007 and Baltimore\u2019s Everyman Theatre in 2009, and now it\u2019s being done at Columbia\u2019s Rep Stage. The old gal gets around. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The reasons are clear: It\u2019s an impressive showcase for any actor who can play the solo show\u2019s dozens of roles. And the true story is a doozy, about a seemingly modest German transvestite (and major antiques collector) born Lothar Berfelde but eventually known to the world as Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, who somehow survived both the Nazi and then the communist East German regimes. That one-two punch made the play a major curiosity when it emerged, earning Wright a Tony and a Pulitzer, with best actor honors for original star Jefferson Mays (who then toured nationally with the show). It\u2019s less splashy but reasonably effective at Rep, although director Tony Tsendeas puts almost all of the storytelling duties squarely on Michael Stebbins\u2019s shoulders. As Charlotte (pronounced Shar-lotta), Stebbins wears the obligatory plain black dress, kerchief and orthopedic shoes, plus a simple strand of pearls. He creates the show\u2019s gallery of characters with voices and accents, moving easily enough from German inflections (\u201cotherwise\u201d sounding like \u201cuzza-vize\u201d) to a gentle drawl for the Texan Wright. Wright\u2019s 1990s journals and interviews with Charlotte are the spine of the story, and it\u2019s an odd bit of hero worship. Wright, who is gay, finds Charlotte\u2019s survival tales inspiring, but things take a twist when he learns that some of those tales may be too good to be true. This is the only part of Stebbins\u2019s performance that nags a little; you wish he could find some rougher textures as Wright \u2014 here played as a kind of put-upon saint \u2014 grows more conflicted about his maddeningly slippery subject. More troubling is the lack of urgency and showmanship in the Rep\u2019s staging. Previous productions of \u201cWife\u201d dramatically featured grand stacks of the furniture and phonographs Charlotte collected, but Tsendeas and set designer Elizabeth Jenkins McFadden forgo that. Stebbins only has miniatures to handle as Charlotte rhapsodizes about one collectible or another, and although a few small frames at the back of the simple living room set glow with artifacts, it\u2019s not enough. The show even seems short on sound and light to help animate the plot (which is not especially propulsive here) and to more richly suggest the enforced norms and shadowy resistance inside Charlotte\u2019s hazardous Germany (and inside her perplexing head). For all its one-man flamboyance, the play is a self-scrutinizing documentary, and it needs more than a capably chameleonic performance to drive it home. It wants the weight of real history. \n I Am My Own Wife \n \n \n by Doug Wright. Directed by Tony Tsendeas. Lights, Jay Herzog; costume design, Jennifer Tardiff; sound design, Neil McFadden.

The deal involves TV interviews and footage of the stricken planes taken by some of the sky divers\u2019 helmet cameras, according to Mike Robinson, a sky-diving instructor who was involved in the incident near Lake Superior in northwest Wisconsin. \u201cNBC has the exclusive right,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWe can do print and radio interviews, but no TV interviews [other than for NBC] for two weeks. That\u2019s the agreement.\u201d Individuals with the network said the group will receive in excess of $100,000 for their participation. NBC would not confirm that figure, but the network said it paid only for use of the video. NBC said other news organizations were also bidding for the material. Mainstream news organizations typically frown on paying sources , lest the payments taint the sources\u2019 veracity or color the news outlet\u2019s objectivity in reporting the story. Although some news organizations, such as the National Enquirer and TMZ.com, pay for news, checkbook journalism is considered unethical by the Society of Professional Journalists and other professional news organizations. NBC News\u2019s agreement with the sky divers follows last week\u2019s disclosure that the news division is negotiating an exclusive documentary deal, reportedly for more than $100,000, with the family of Hannah Anderson, the teenage girl who was kidnapped this summer by a family friend who had murdered her mother and brother. Anderson, who survived her ordeal, already has appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cDateline NBC\u201d in a series of exclusive interviews with the network. The two deals signal a more aggressive approach to securing ratings-grabbing exclusives by Deborah Turness, NBC News\u2019s new president. Turness joined the network in August from ITV News, Britain\u2019s leading commercial TV network. NBC News is under pressure to restore the ratings dominance of the \u201cToday\u201d show, which has fallen behind its ABC rival, \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d in the lucrative morning-news period. The two programs compete ferociously to book newsworthy guests, particularly those with a strong appeal to women, who comprise the majority of viewers for both shows. The competition has led to bidding wars for of-the-moment interview subjects in the past, although ABC News said it has banned the practice of paying for interviews. In a statement, NBC News spokeswoman Ali Zelenko said, \u201cNBC News is proud to have this remarkable footage of human survival for use across all of our platforms and broadcasts, including an hour-long \u2018Dateline\u2019 special. Our licensing of this footage is standard industry practice and is the result of a very competitive process with other major broadcast outlets.\u201d Robinson said that interviews with the participants also were part of the agreement with NBC News. ABC News said it was involved in the bidding for the video, but it pulled out \u201cas soon as it became clear that these interviews were tied directly to cash payments,\u201d spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said. Paying for interviews \u201cis a clear violation of our standards and ethics. We wanted to bid solely for the rights to the footage.\u201d The sky-diving video may be particularly valuable because the story occurred during a \u201csweeps\u201d month in television, one of four quarterly periods in which ratings are used as a benchmark by local stations to set advertising rates for non-sweeps periods. TV stations typically promote their news programs heavily during sweeps months such as November and February in order to drive up viewership. Robinson, 64, and three sky divers were seconds away from leaping out of a Cessna airplane for their final sky-dive of the day Saturday when a plane carrying another group of sky divers hit the top of their plane. Robinson\u2019s plane burst into flames and began to break apart as the sky divers leapt from it. The pilot of their plane ejected and used an emergency parachute to land safely as the plane spiraled downward and showered the falling divers with debris. The pilot of the second plane, which was damaged, managed to land the plane safely to the airport. None of the nine sky divers and two pilots were seriously injured in the accident, which is under investigation. The dramatic footage, taken from the sky divers\u2019 perspective, hasn\u2019t been seen on TV yet. But, said Robinson, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all of it. It\u2019s pretty dramatic.\u201d", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Paul Farhi", "wordCount": 765}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Reliable Source: The Scene: Washington Ballet\u2019s \u2018Unmask the Night\u2019 fundraiser", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/334b9cc0/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Creliable0Esource0Cpost0Cthe0Escene0Ewashington0Eballets0Eunmask0Ethe0Enight0Efundraiser0C20A130C110C0A40C3d4bdf6a0E45940E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Rebecca D\u2019Angelo", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Reliable Source: Love, etc.: Chris Kirkpatrick gets married, results in another elusive \u2018N SYNC reunion", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/334b1edc/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Creliable0Esource0Cpost0Clove0Eetc0Echris0Ekirkpatrick0Egets0Emarried0Eresults0Ein0Eanother0Eelusive0En0Esync0Ereunion0C20A130C110C0A40C0Ac0A532de0E4590A0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "The Reliable Source", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "MacKenzie Bezos doesn\u2019t like new book about her husband, Amazon.com chief Jeff Bezos", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/334b1ede/sc/21/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cstyle0Cmackenzie0Ebezos0Edoesnt0Elike0Enew0Ebook0Eabout0Eher0Ehusband0Eamazoncom0Echief0Ejeff0Ebezos0C20A130C110C0A40C49a4f7620E458d0E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "The Internet is credited with democratizing criticism \u2013 allowing the everyday viewer or listener or reader to compete with the ones paid by media outlets.

It sets the tone, defines parameters and suggests avenues for exploration. The National Gallery\u2019s 65th American Music Festival opened Sunday night with a fascinating program dedicated to Charles Ives and Aaron Copland. In its ambition and scope, the concert offered nothing less than two competing musical visions of America itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The evening featured the Maryland Sinfonietta, a student chamber orchestra from the University of Maryland, led by Michael Jacko. If musical standards and ensemble values were not always upheld, the ideas provoked by the programming were illuminating. The juxtaposition of Ives\u2019s \u201cThree Places in New England\u201d and Copland\u2019s \u201cAppalachian Spring\u201d offered a rich study in American mythmaking. The landscapes of \u201cThree Places,\u201d built upon the fragmenting and layering of American folk songs, hymn tunes and ditties, are haunted by time and distorted by memory. The Sinfonietta evoked the dissonant fog of the Civil War in the \u201cSt. Gaudens\u201d movement, but individual motifs struggled to find definition. \u201cPutnam\u2019s Camp,\u201d with its boisterous and overlapping patriotic tunes, fared better, driven by the ensemble\u2019s bright, propulsive energy. Baritone Andrew McLaughlin provided the brooding vocal line for the final movement, \u201cThe Housatonic at Stockbridge,\u201d whose memory of a summer\u2019s walk in the Berkshires emerged as a fevered dream. Two lively songs by Ives, \u201cCharlie Rutlage\u201d and \u201cGeneral William Booth Enters into Heaven,\u201d reinforced the composer\u2019s experimentation with the American vernacular. \u201cAppalachian Spring,\u201d in its streamlined, sentimental concert version, offered an alternate vision of America: spare yet comforting in its melodies, nostalgic yet aspirational in its mythos. If the ensemble sounded tentative and lacked polish, there was consolation in the many moments of unaffected lyricism, not least of which were Elise Bond\u2019s mellifluous clarinet solos. While not a majestic \u201cAppalachian Spring,\u201d this performance nonetheless offered simple gifts. \n Chin is a freelance writer.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Simon Chin", "wordCount": 305}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Music review: Boris Giltburg\u2019s debut recital", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/334a8a3c/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Cmusic0Ereview0Eboris0Egiltburgs0Edebut0Erecital0C20A130C110C0A40C89be0Adcc0E45680E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "Another day, another recent competition winner\u2019s debut recital in Washington.

He is a steely player who tends to wallop rather than caress the keyboard. He brought the audience to its feet mostly with circus-like demonstrations of virtuosity in Prokofiev\u2019s eighth sonata (Op. 84, B-flat major), especially the blockbuster finale, played with savage accuracy, and in the orchestral vastness of sound he produced in Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse.\u201d Sections of both pieces that pose fewer technical challenges were played expressively, but in a generally predictable and less audacious way.  Rachmaninoff\u2019s Op. 23 preludes featured many of the same qualities, hammered fortes in a wild tumult of notes in No. 2, overly soupy rubato in Nos. 4 and 10. The most telling sign of this interpretative weakness was in the three encores, all extensions of the waltz theme introduced by the Ravel piece.

The only one that brought the audience back to its feet was Rachmaninoff\u2019s A minor etude-tableau, \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood and the Wolf,\u201d again because of its bravura qualities more than its musical ones. \n Downey is a freelance writer.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Charles T.

In \u201cIndifference,\u201d we say goodbye to Carol, not in a bloody battle, but behind the wheel of an old station wagon as she drives away after being cast out of the prison community by Rick.  Carol has transformed from the scared, battered and weak character she was in season one to someone numb to violence, pain or fear. Carol was cold and calculating when she murdered Karen and David, she tells Rick, because it was what she thought she needed to do to save lives. \u201cIt\u2019s about facing reality,\u201d she says of her decision. Carol shows Rick her hardened side once again while out on a run for supplies. She is somewhat indifferent after meeting a nice, young couple hiding in one of the suburban homes. The couple \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 does not survive the episode, and Carol barely bats an eye. She\u2019s seen too many people die, including her daughter, to care that much anymore. Carol has become a shadow of her past self, and Rick does not like it. They seem to fundamentally disagree on issues of survival and morality, making Rick genuinely afraid of letting Carol be near his children. Rick also knows the reality of what Carol faces if Tyreese finds out about the murders. How the past has shaped the current cast of survivors plays a big part in this week\u2019s episode. Rick and Carol discuss everything from Carol\u2019s struggle with her abusive husband to Lori\u2019s habit of making pancakes every Sunday for Rick and Carl. After last week\u2019s car troubles, Michonne, Tyreese, Daryl and Bob stumble upon an abandoned gas station and work to revive a vehicle. Bob and Daryl discuss the groups Bob used to travel with while Michonne tries to coach Tyreese through his anger regarding Karen\u2019s death. After starting the car and quickly gathering supplies at the veterinary hospital, Bob\u2019s battle with alcoholism (first hinted at in the store raid from the season premiere), almost derails their successful trip. This season, the survivors are coming to terms with who they are, who they\u2019ve become and how it affects their actions.

In her live rendition of the \u201cAbegg Variations\u201d (Op. 1), the slow variations were even more distracted and moony, the rubato almost excessively free, and the fast ones just as polished and intricate. Her interpretation of the \u201cSymphonic Etudes\u201d (Op. 13), however, did not convince, as it was a little too controlled and cautious. She certainly mastered the work\u2019s technical challenges, but that is not enough. Rana played one of Prokofiev\u2019s concertos at the Cliburn Competition, and she gave his sixth piano sonata, a piece that is new to her repertory, plenty of sharp-fingered intensity, especially in a pristine performance of the blistering fourth movement. Rana\u2019s poise and intelligence came through, though, just as they did in the question-and-answer session that followed the recital, in which she spoke of her obsessive love of reading, especially the fiction of Haruki Murakami.

Several participants in a conversation on Facebook took particular exception to my claim that the show\u2019s lack of focus was \u201ca telling symptom of an insoluble problem: Latino art, today, is a meaningless category.\u201d I asked the author of the original post, digital artist and filmmaker Alex Rivera, best known for his Sundance award-winning feature film \u201c Sleep Dealer ,\u201d if he would like to have the conversation more publicly. He agreed, and what follows is a shorter, edited version of an e-mail exchange over a two-day period . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n \n ALEX RIVERA: \n Can you explain why you used your review of this show to make a pronouncement about the entire concept of \u201cLatino art\u201d? It seems to happen over and over again : When a group show like this one is mounted, critics attack the fundamental notion of looking at the work as a group. Why? The problem is that, while critics raise doubts about categories like \u201cLatino Art,\u201d there\u2019s never any discussion of the absence of that work in show after show that keeps groups like Latinos on the margins or excluded entirely from the American conversation. For example: The 2012 Whitney Biennial featured exactly zero Latino artists. How can that be a survey of \u201cAmerican Art\u201d? It seems like the absence of Latino artists is normal, not newsworthy, but the organizing of our presence causes questions about our existence. \n\n \n PHILIP KENNICOTT: \n I called Latino art a meaningless category for two reasons. First, I think it is so broad as to be meaningless. Is all of the art [by artists of Cuban, Puerto Rican and Mexican heritage] in fact linked by some essential unifying thing? Is the art made by a Cuban exile educated in Paris somehow similar to street art made by a Mexican American in Los Angeles? Maybe, but then tell me what the link is. \n The second reason I said it was that the curators seem to argue exactly that: They insist that the show isn\u2019t about labeling, isn\u2019t about defining anything essential about the category of Latino art. As a critic, you begin to wonder why bother doing these group shows if the ultimate intent (and a desirable one) is to place the focus back on individual artists, and individual artworks, rather than the group identity that everyone seems to resist? \n I take your point about the absence of Latino artists in many exhibitions, though one of the best shows I\u2019ve seen recently that attempted to negotiate the idea of group identity, the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s \u201c Hide/Seek \u201d devoted to gay artists, had a robust representation of art by Latinos. \n\n \n AR: \n I should have mentioned in my first message: I wish you\u2019d had a better time at the museum! Reading your comments, a question comes to mind: Do you find \u201cLatino art\u201d meaningless, or do you find the notion of \u201cLatino\u201d meaningless? I ask because I understand your observation that there\u2019s a lot of diversity within the imagined community of \u201cLatinos.\u201d What big grouping of people doesn\u2019t embody diversity and conflict within itself? I imagine you regularly review shows in museums of \u201cAmerican art\u201d but never spend the review space critiquing the concept of \u201cAmerican.\u201d \n   In terms of what unites Latino artists, well, it might be aesthetics that one way or another trace back to distant Spanish and Indigenous influence. It might be an engagement with questions of assimilation in the U.S. or of migration or exile. It could be none of these. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But one strong glue that unites the community of Latino artists I know is awareness that we\u2019re still \u201coutsiders\u201d in spaces which claim to speak for the nation. Isn\u2019t long-standing absence enough \u201cglue\u201d to make this survey of Latino art at the Smithsonian a worthy endeavor? \n\n \n PK: \n You ask if it\u2019s Latino art I find meaningless, or \u201cthe notion of \u2018Latino\u2019 art\u201d? Emphatically the latter. What I grappled with [in my review] is the use of the label \u2014 \u201cOur America: The Latino Presence in American Art\u201d \u2014 in a show that doesn\u2019t seem to want to even accept the validity of that label. You give one possible avenue for finding meaning in the category: the origins of some of the visual material in the \u201cdistant Spanish and Indigenous influence.\u201d And I gave some other possibilities: One would be looking at the wonderfully provocative and visually incisive Chicano art movement of the 1960s and \u201970s. But you see, we\u2019re already whittling a big category down to smaller ones. That\u2019s a healthy thing, I\u2019d argue, forcing people to think about real connections, not simply labels. Again, I point out that my problem with the label has a lot to do with how many Latino artists resist it, just as many African American artists resist being labeled, and so, too, gay artists. \n\n\n \n\n \n AR: \n Apologies for any confusion. To be clearer, you explained that you find \u201cLatino art\u201d a meaningless category because it is broad (encompassing Chicano, Cuban, Puerto Rican artists, etc.). So, I was curious if it was not \u201cLatino art\u201d that you had trouble with, but the simpler notion of \u201cLatino\u201d as an identity category at all. \n\n That\u2019s what I meant to suggest \u2014 that perhaps you don\u2019t find grouping together tens of millions of people in this way helpful. And if you don\u2019t see the commonality of experience in that imagined community, then of course a survey of our artistic output would seem a fruitless exercise. And so: Do you think \u201cLatino\u201d is a useful category for thinking about people? Does it illuminate anything about history or just confound? If not, what do we call ourselves? If so, why can\u2019t we have something called \u201cLatino art\u201d? \n\n \n PK: \n As a demographic category I\u2019m sure Latino is useful, and I don\u2019t want to suggest that the category isn\u2019t meaningful for people who embrace it. Identity is deeply personal and something we construct. But demographic categories aren\u2019t necessarily useful for explaining habits, preferences and behavior. \u201cLatino shoe preference\u201d or \u201cgay driving habits\u201d don\u2019t really refer to useful ideas, do they? As for your argument that \u201cthere needs to be a presence of something called \u2018Latino art in a museum like the Smithsonian\u201d I would agree if we insert one word: \u201cGreat.\u201d There absolutely needs to be a better representation of great Latino art in a museum like the Smithsonian. And many of the pieces in the exhibition I reviewed qualify for that inclusion. \n\n \n AR: \n Well, for starters, I agree that \u201cLatino shoe preference\u201d is not a meaningful category. (But I bet readers involved in marketing shoes would disagree.) I also agree that how we identify is a personal decision. And that \u201cLatino\u201d is a big, unruly way to categorize people. Like \u201cAmerican.\u201d But here\u2019s the rub: We\u2019re very used to reading reviews like [yours]. Take this review in the New York Times of \u201c Phantom Sightings ,\u201d an exhibition of post-Chicano art, which starts with the line: \u201cIs it time to retire the identity-based group show?\u201d Time and again, reviews of shows that feature work of \u201cminority groups\u201d (who are in many instances majorities in cities where the art world thrives, but whatever) become the occasion not to talk about the show at hand, but to attack the fundamental gesture of curating shows featuring our work. In your review, you took an angle which attacked not the show at hand \u2014 but the entire meaning of \u201cLatino art\u201d as a category. A good portion was also spent on critiquing the general direction of the institution of the Smithsonian. \n\n I don\u2019t doubt the show is imperfect, and worthy of critique. \n\n But in the future I hope to read reviews that take me into the show, on the show\u2019s terms. \n\n And reviews that accept as a starting point that presenting the work of people who inhabit big categories like \u201cLatino artists\u201d is vital an d urgent.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Philip Kennicott", "wordCount": 1317}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Bolz-Weber\u2019s liberal, foulmouthed articulation of Christianity speaks to fed-up believers", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/3342bf2d/sc/8/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clocal0Cbolz0Ewebers0Eliberal0Efoulmouthed0Earticulation0Eof0Echristianity0Espeaks0Eto0Efed0Eup0Ebelievers0C20A130C110C0A30C7139dc240E3cd30E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "AUSTIN \u2014 Nadia Bolz-Weber bounds into the University United Methodist Church sanctuary like a superhero from Planet Alternative Christian. Her 6-foot-1 frame is plastered with tattoos, her arms are sculpted by competitive weightlifting and, to show it all off, this pastor is wearing a tight tank top and jeans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Looking out at the hundreds of people crowded into the pews to hear her present the gospel of Jesus Christ, she sees: Dockers and blazers. Sensible shoes. Grandmothers and soccer moms. Nary a facial piercing.  To Bolz-Weber\u2019s bafflement, this is now her congregation: mainstream America. These are the people who put her memoir near the top of the New York Times bestseller list the week it came out in September. They are the ones who follow her every tweet and Facebook post by the thousands, and who have made the Lutheran minister a budding star for the liberal Christian set. And who, as Bolz-Weber has described it in her frequently profane dialect, \u201care [mess]ing up my weird.\u201d A quick tour through her 44 years doesn\u2019t seem likely to wind up here. It includes teen rebellion against her family\u2019s fundamentalist Christianity, a nose dive into drug and alcohol addiction, a lifestyle of sleeping around and a stint doing stand-up in a grungy Denver comedy club. She is part of society\u2019s outsiders, she writes in her memoir, its \u201cunderside dwellers .\u2009.\u2009. cynics, alcoholics and queers.\u201d Which is where \u2014 strangely enough \u2014 the match with her fans makes sense. The type of social liberals who typically fill the pews of mainline churches sometimes feel like outsiders among fellow liberals in their lives if they are truly believing Christians; if they are people who really experience Jesus and his resurrection, even if they can\u2019t explain it scientifically; if they are people who want to hear words from the Apostles in church, not Thich Nhat Hanh or Barack Obama. In her body and her theology, Bolz-Weber represents a new, muscular form of liberal Christianity, one that merges the passion and life-changing fervor of evangelicalism with the commitment to inclusiveness and social justice of mainline Protestantism. She\u2019s a tatted-up, foul-mouthed champion to people sick of being belittled as not Christian enough for the right or too Jesus-y for the left. \u201cYou show us all your dirty laundry! It\u2019s all out there!\u201d the Rev. John Elford of the University United Methodist Church booms, as if he is introducing a rock star, leading the cheering crowd into an impassioned round of hymn-singing. Bolz-Weber springs onstage to do a reading from her book, but first she addresses the language that\u2019s about to be unleashed on the pulpit: \u201cI don\u2019t think church leaders should pretend to be something they\u2019re not.\u201d The crowd erupts into applause. Bolz-Weber pulls out a few kitschy items that she raffles off to raise money for a local charity. She waves a gift certificate for a free tattoo. Then she speaks to her new reality: \u201cYou ladies over 70 dig deep, because you know you want it!\u201d \n God without answers \n Bolz-Weber\u2019s appeal is unquestionably part packaging: dramatic back story, cool appearance, super-entertaining delivery. She launched a successful church for disaffected young people and has headlined youth gatherings tens of thousands strong. For a part of American religion that\u2019s been in a long, slow institutional decline , this gives her major credibility.  \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t She\u2019s on a plane nearly every week to headline church leadership gatherings because of the way she articulates the place of the religious liberal in America. Next up is Calvary Baptist Church in Washington\u2019s Chinatown, where she will speak to an overflow crowd of more than 600 people Tuesday evening. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Her message: Forget what you\u2019ve been told about the golden rule \u2014 God doesn\u2019t love you more if you do good things, or if you believe certain things. God, she argues, offers you grace regardless of who you are or what you do. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Christianity, Bolz-Weber preaches, has nothing to do with rules; it is the process of things constantly dying and then being made new. Those things, she says, might be the alcoholic who emerges into sobriety, some false narrative we have about ourselves, religious institutions that no longer inspire. \u201cI think God is wanting to be known. And my experience of God wanting to be known is much more in the person who is annoying me at the moment rather than in the sunset,\u201d she says. God is present in these challenging interactions, she believes. \u201cI never experience God in camping or trees or nature. I hate nature,\u201d she told the Austin crowd as she paced the stage. \u201cGod invented takeout and duvets for a reason.\u201d This emphasis on experience over rules challenges conservatives, but it also bothers progressives who have turned church into what she views as essentially a nonprofit organization. \u201cThis isn\u2019t supposed to be the Elks Club with the Eucharist,\u201d Bolz-Weber said in a taxi ride before her Austin talk. Religion should be \u201csomething that\u2019s so devastatingly beautiful it can break your heart. Instead it\u2019s been: \u2018Recycle.\u2019 And \u2018Don\u2019t sleep with your girlfriend.\u2019\u2009\u201d Bolz-Weber says she abhors \u201cspirituality,\u201d which she sees as a limp kind of self-improvement plan. She prefers a cranky, troublemaking and real God who at times of loss and pain doesn\u2019t have the answers either. \u201cGod isn\u2019t feeling smug about the whole thing,\u201d she writes about Jesus\u2019s resurrection and the idea that the story is used as fodder for judgment. \u201cGod is not distant at the cross. .\u2009.\u2009. God is there in the messy mascara-streaked middle of it, feeling as [bad] as the rest of us.\u201d This very physical way of talking about God is thrilling to a lot of people who grew up in liberal Christianity. \u201cHere\u2019s Nadia \u2014 boom! \u201d said Jeff Krehbiel, a Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) pastor in the District who leads a national group on revitalizing U.S. congregations. \u201cFor her, this isn\u2019t some metaphor, this is something real that changed the world and changed my life. How do we talk about this as people who want to use their heads? .\u2009.\u2009. I think people like her are resonating with a growing group of Christians who are asking the same kinds of questions.\u201d To Carmen Retzlaff, a newly ordained Lutheran pastor who came with her husband to the Austin talk, Bolz-Weber is liberating \u2014 partly because she\u2019s \u201cunapologetic\u201d about her faith. \u201cShe talks a lot about JEE-sus\u201d \u2014 Retzlaff giggles here \u2014 \u201cwhich hasn\u2019t always been a place of comfort in an increasingly secular world. I really love that.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t  Some people, of course, really hate that. Her memoir\u2019s title, in fact, comes from the nickname given to her by one of her critics who opposes female clergy. The book is called \u201c Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner and Saint .\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n From drugs to pulpit \n At the core of Bolz-Weber\u2019s five-year-old Denver church, the House for All Sinners and Saints, are people who felt hurt by religion \u2014 as she did. Early on, she says, she was aware of hypocrisy, homophobia and sexism in her fundamentalist upbringing. As a teenager, she had a thyroid disorder that caused her eyes to bug far out of her head, and she always had the feeling that she didn\u2019t belong. She marinated her anger in drugs and alcohol for about a decade. Yet she never stopped believing in God. She dabbled for years with Wicca and experimented with every liberal faith group, from Unitarians to Quakers. She performed stand-up as a type of no-cost therapy. It was going through anti-addiction recovery that finally soothed her anger. Her encounter with a tall, cute, Lutheran seminary student named Matthew Weber brought her back to church. They married in 1996 and have two children. She first heard the call to pastor in a downtown Denver comedy club at which she and a bunch of her old runaround pals gathered in 2004 to eulogize a friend who had hanged himself. As the only religious member, she was asked to lead the service. Her vocation to her fellow outsiders was born. Four years and a seminary degree later, Bolz-Weber founded what today is casually called House. It\u2019s a start-up of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, with an \u201canti-excellence, pro-participation\u201d policy. It meets in the parish hall of an Episcopal church. Seating is arranged around an unelevated circle, lay people can pick up a card and help run the service, and sermons by Bolz-Weber are usually 12 minutes tops. Singing is all a capella and every service has a creative, congregant-run, interactive program. \u201cSometimes I ask myself, why aren\u2019t we at 1,000 people? This church is unbelievable,\u201d said Aram Harotunian, a former evangelical megachurch pastor who goes to House. \u201cFor 21 years, I felt I had to keep people in line, and it felt like bondage to me. House has a lot of people burned by religion, and this still holds for me. It\u2019s the only church I can stomach.\u201d But House has had its own unconventional crisis in recent years, after the suburbanites started showing up. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d Bolz-Weber writes. It seemed as if her \u201cprecious little indie boutique of a church\u201d might be overrun by bankers and doctors. She called her pastor friends to ask, \u201cHave you ever had normal people take over your church?\u201d The church had to call a meeting that is now basic House lore. The newcomers described how they felt inspired by the liturgy, and the younger outsider-types who had been there from the beginning wound up saying it was kind of nice to see someone who looked like their moms or dads but was accepting. Bolz-Weber characterizes herself as having had \u201ca heart transplant.\u201d This is typical for someone who presents herself as the \u201canti-pastor\u201d: cranky, intolerant, egotistical, but always open to Jesus making her better. \n Growing pains \n These days, about 180 people show up each Sunday, an eclectic mix of homeless and corporate types, punk teens and suburban baby boomers sitting on stacking chairs in the rented hall. Bolz-Weber\u2019s growing popularity has forced the questions: How deeply into convention can she stand going? Can she stomach the idea of hiring staff? Of being mega? The congregation is \u201cbecoming big and it\u2019s freaking her out, because that\u2019s not her gift,\u201d said Harotunian. \u201cIt gets to her identity \u2014 what kind of pastor does she want to be? A lot of people think she\u2019s going to climb the ladder. but I don\u2019t think she can do that. It\u2019s very precarious.\u201d For her part, Bolz-Weber is open about wondering how long she can be a nonstop tweeting-and-traveling machine. \u201cChristianity is supposed to give me a mild sense of discomfort. I don\u2019t get to be in control,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always putting me into something new.\u201d", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Michelle Boorstein", "wordCount": 1755}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Review: Tommy Tune turns on the charm at Kennedy Center\u2019s Terrace Theater", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/33400eaa/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Centertainment0Cmusic0Creview0Etommy0Etune0Eturns0Eon0Ethe0Echarm0Eat0Ekennedy0Ecenters0Eterrace0Etheater0C20A130C110C0A30C78fad7c0A0E448e0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "Tommy Tune has always broken the mold, and the 6-foot-6 singin\u2019, dancin\u2019 Texan did it again Friday night at the Kennedy Center\u2019s Terrace Theater. In a loping tempo, Tune, 74, danced on a small portable tap stage roughly the size of a good bath towel and made it seem like infinite space. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Tune\u2019s current \u201cTaps, Tunes and Tall Tales\u201d isn\u2019t terribly different from his recent \u201cSteps in Time\u201d ; both pieces riff warmly over his showbiz career (now entering its 55th year, he announced proudly). He gabs about his Texas roots, his unlikely early auditions and his triumphs as a performer, director and choreographer, all in easygoing patter between lightly crooned melodies such as \u201cI\u2019m Leavin\u2019 Texas\u201d and \u201cYou Gotta Have Heart.\u201d \u201cTaps\u201d is leaner; on Friday, it was just Tune (in a trim red three-piece suit) and his longtime musical director/pianist Michael Biagi, who was sporting a striped shirt, vest and bowler and looking as if he had been plucked straight from a vaudeville stage or a Jazz Age saloon. Even so, with little more than a smile and a song, Tune created a show that occasionally felt sneaky-big. Performers in the Kennedy Center\u2019s Barbara Cook series typically don\u2019t fuss much with design; it\u2019s a one-night-only showcase for singers. Yet Tune had lighting designer and production supervisor Patrick Rinn lower the lighting grid so that it hung in plain view, adding a potent theatrical ambiance to an evening laced with anecdotes about Tune\u2019s encounters with, oh, Laurence Olivier, Orson Welles, Carol Channing. (Apparently, when Tune and Channing chat, they address each other as \u201cTommy Tune\u201d and \u201cCarol Channing.\u201d It sounds adorable.) Late in the evening, Rinn cut the lights to knee height as Tune danced to a Gershwin medley anchored by \u201cThey Can\u2019t Take That Away From Me,\u201d this time using the full width of the stage, tapping at a measured pace but steadily adding to the patterns, and building to a finish that Biagi punctuated with a grand phrase from \u201cRhapsody in Blue.\u201d The illusion was wonderful: It felt as if you\u2019d glimpsed a full-blown show and somehow crossed a bridge back to a less overwhelming, more charming Broadway.", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "Nelson Pressley", "wordCount": 356}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Reliable Source: Oprah holds a yard sale, raises $600,000", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636609/s/33414965/sc/19/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Creliable0Esource0Cpost0Coprah0Eholds0Ea0Eyard0Esale0Eraises0E60A0A0A0A0A0C20A130C110C0A30C59a7b6a60E44d70E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Istyle/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["lifestyle", "style"], "author": "The Reliable Source", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Reliable Source: Love, etc.: Rep.

We have helped her in many ways \u2014 with friendship, taking her shopping, bringing over baked treats, and stepping in, in emergency situations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t This neighbor now seems to think we (mainly me) are her go-to people for everything. She has a son who lives nearby, but he seems to not show up much. I blew up a few weeks ago when I was dealing with my own problems and told her I can\u2019t be everything to everyone. She apologized and said she understood. But it hasn\u2019t stopped and I have had it. My husband doesn\u2019t really deal with her on the same level and now he makes me feel guilty when I can\u2019t tolerate being her problem-solver anymore. The stress from her gives me headaches. She had a very good and interesting job, traveled the world, and yet has not an ounce of common sense. -- Not My Neighbor\u2019s Keeper DEAR KEEPER: Your kindness has conditioned your needy neighbor to rely on you for everyday \u2014 and emergency \u2014 help. Blowing up suddenly because you feel used will not retrain your neighbor. It will only make her think that you are volatile (especially if, as you say, she lacks common sense). I assume you think you don\u2019t owe her anything further, but you do owe her a respectful and rational explanation, along with some guidelines to which you will adhere, even if she doesn\u2019t. You tell her, \u201cI can\u2019t do the things for you that I used to do. You\u2019re going to have to find other ways to get what you need, day-to-day.\u201d Research options for elder transportation or services in your area. But unless she is unusually impaired, it will be her responsibility to follow through. You should also follow up with her son (if possible) to let him know that you are backing off. If she calls you with a non-emergency matter, you should tell her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help out today.\u201d Stepping back might give you more energy (and renewed kindness) to step in as the world\u2019s greatest neighbor with assistance when she really needs you. If your husband lays guilt on you about this, tell him he should step up more. DEAR AMY: I would like to date my sister\u2019s sister-in-law. When I expressed my romantic interest to her, she said that our families were too close and she would not want any resentment if our relationship didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019ve tried the platonic approach but the friendship wasn\u2019t reciprocated. Any advice, ideas or suggestions? -- Crushed Sibling DEAR CRUSHED: If you express romantic interest in someone and she rebuffs you, then you need to back off. If you express platonic friendship interest in someone and she doesn\u2019t reciprocate, then you have a definitive answer: She is not at all into you. DEAR AMY: Your recent advice regarding the emotional distress caused by surprises in wills made me think of my recently departed mother. While she was in good health more than a decade ago, she sat down with me and my three siblings to share her final wishes, neatly organized in a three-ring binder which she updated annually. Her current will, Do Not Resuscitate document, bank/investment statements and insurance policies were included, as were her wishes for her funeral. Everything from the dress she saved to be buried in to the readings and music were included, and she did so with humor. (Example: \u201cAnyone who shows up for my funeral deserves a hot meal. Don\u2019t skimp on a catered lunch or I\u2019ll come back to haunt you.\u201d) Her pre-planning and the transparency of her final wishes made things incredibly easy on us, and \u2014 despite the sadness of her passing \u2014 we were able to draw strength, comfort and even chuckles from the notes she left for us, allowing us to truly celebrate her life while we mourned her death. As a result, the four of us have all created our own binders patterned after hers and peppered with fond memories and anecdotes to help our survivors cope in similar fashion. -- Grateful DEAR GRATEFUL: This is a fantastic idea.

Is there any way I can set behavioral expectations ahead of time in a way that won\u2019t make her angry, or should I just grin and bear whatever she throws at me? \n \n Bride \n I\u2019m going to go with (c) Develop a better understanding of, and emotional resilience with, your mother. There\u2019s no \u201cof course\u201d in she \u201cmakes me feel awful.\u201d To see it that way is to give her power over you when you can claim that power yourself. Specifically, you can choose not to take your mom\u2019s hostility personally because all of it \u2014 all \u2014 is about her. Who criticizes a bride\u2019s dress? Someone who is too emotionally stunted to even be happy for her own child, that\u2019s who. (Translation: When you\u2019re the center of attention, then *gasp* she can\u2019t be!!) And that\u2019s some sorry stuff. As too is the screaming about learning details from a cousin (translation: \u201cEveryone must think I\u2019m out of the wedding loop, how embarrassing!!\u201d), as is criticizing when it\u2019s too late to change something (translation: She gets the last word). As is her silent treatment (translation: \u201c[Bride] doesn\u2019t get what she wants till I get what I want!\u201d) So, you needn\u2019t worry that she\u2019ll act up at your wedding \u2014 you can go straight to counting on it. But instead of being terrified, be prepared: 1. She will undermine you as you head down the aisle, because she has to. It\u2019s where she is, emotionally. 2. It will be lousy for you, since who wants that kind of crud pie from her own mother \u2014 but it will be far worse for her. She doesn\u2019t find joy where humans reliably find it; she finds insecurity and anxiety. Would you want to be in her place? 3. You have options. You can adopt a mantra, for example \u2014 \u201cShe does this because she\u2019s needy, and it\u2019s not about me\u201d; or talk to a good family therapist; or develop cheery responses that deflect barbs, like, \u201cOh, Mother, really\u201d; or decline to engage with absurdity. For example: Why on earth were you apologizing for the cousin incident when you did nothing wrong? Ideally, you can combine these approaches. Just avoid the one where you try to preempt her attacks. That will just frustrate you and, worse, invest you in changing her behavior (which puts her in control) instead of brushing it off (which puts you in control). Congrats, good luck, and train your eyes on the good. \n Write to Carolyn Hax, Style, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071, or tellme@washpost.com .

We\u2019ve lived together for eight months now, and I\u2019m not happy with how things have turned out. We get along really well. It\u2019s just that now I am paying all the bills \u2014 rent, groceries, gas, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t I feel like I\u2019m being used for my money and to support her and her 1-year-old daughter. This is stressful. I just got her a new job, working for the same company I work for but at a different location. Still, I feel like I\u2019m going to end up taking care of the bills once again and I can\u2019t do it anymore. I don\u2019t have the money to help her out anymore. I\u2019d feel bad if I moved out because she wouldn\u2019t have any place to go. She could go to her mom\u2019s house but they don\u2019t get along very well. I feel pressured to stay here because I am the kind of person that likes to put others before myself but I know it\u2019s time to take care of me now. I just don\u2019t know what to do. My grandmother and my mother both told me that I need to get out of this situation, but what do you think I should do? -- Stressed Roommate DEAR STRESSED: The most logical answer is for you to treat your friend like a grown-up, while also respecting yourself more. It sounds like you have been a real hero here. Single moms with young children need all the love, support and friendship they can get \u2014 but you cannot do it all for your friend. You simply must take care of yourself. If you respond to this pressure by moving out, your friend will pack up and move on and find someone else to pay the bills. This will not be good for her, or her daughter \u2014 or for you. She is working now (thanks to you), so you two should sit down together and split the bills fairly. If she can put some bills in her name (utilities, for instance), she will be responsible for paying them on time and will build up good credit by doing so. Succeeding at this will be good for both of you. If she cannot agree to reasonable terms (and keep them), then you should definitely move on. DEAR AMY: My daughter, who\u2019s in her late 20s, is planning to go to Europe alone. She plans to meet up and stay with a tour operator she met on a recent one-week European cruise that she took with her brother. No danger signals were noted (or heeded) at that time. My wife and I are concerned that it is unseemly and unladylike to stay a week with a new friend (who is basically a stranger) of the opposite sex. We also feel this could turn out badly if the person is a front for sex-trafficking groups. Can you help us to persuade her that this is a terrible idea? -- Dad DEAR DAD: I can\u2019t come up with arguments for you to use in trying to control a grown woman \u2014 especially those having to do with what is (or isn\u2019t) \u201cladylike.\u201d Yes, this tour operator could be a front for sex-trafficking groups. He could also be a cheat, a player, a loser \u2014 or merely French. He could also turn out to be a nice guy. I agree that it is not a good idea to stay with someone for a week whom you don\u2019t know well (a week can be very long if you find you\u2019re with someone you don\u2019t actually like very much). You should ask her to check in personally with you (through Skype or e-mail from her personal address) and suggest that she arrange an alternate place to stay if she finds she doesn\u2019t enjoy being with this person. DEAR AMY: Excellent response concerning the new baby that may (or may not) be named after another family member. At a family event someone mentioned how nice it was that my niece \u201cMary\u201d had my middle name.

Do you have any advice on how I can separate them? -- A Reader, via e-mail I do have a method you can try. It involves a little household physics. In the inner glass, place ice cubes and fill with very cold water. This will cause the glass to contract. Then fill a large bowl or the sink with very warm water (not boiling) and place the outer glass in it. The warm temperature will cause the outer glass to expand. Let the glasses sit for a few minutes to allow the different temperatures to work. Gently pull the glasses apart. You may need to twist them a little \u2014 just be careful. Do not use this method on fragile, old or damaged glasses. You also can try putting a little lubricating oil in between the glasses. -- Heloise COLOR-CODING RESPONSE Dear Heloise: A woman suggested color-coding the numbering system on plastic bottles, etc., to know how to sort them for recycling. This could increase costs a great deal in the manufacturing of bottles and other containers, a cost that would be passed down to us as consumers. For those having trouble reading the symbols, I\u2019d like to suggest taking a marker (permanent or not) and rubbing the side of it over the raised coded symbol, making the symbol easier to see.

Because if that\u2019s true my kids are going to be kitten-throttling serial killers. The dogs have too many toys, I plan most vacations so I can bring them along, and I have a habit of praising them for existing. If one of them comes over all waggy, I\u2019ll put down my book in a heartbeat to lavish unearned adoration on them. \n \n This means my kids are going to be entitled, self-centered, unsympathetic, instant-gratification-focused nightmares, right? And they probably won\u2019t run the vacuum, either. \n \n Dog Owner \n I do still think that. And if you plan to treat any children exactly as you treat your dogs, then, yes, CPS will look unkindly upon your letting the kids outside to poop in the yard. Treating your dogs in a way that\u2019s right for dogs, though, usually means you\u2019ll treat kids in a way that\u2019s right for kids, so it\u2019s a fine indicator. \n Re: Dog Ownership + Parenting: \n \n Although I suspect the dog owner was being facetious, I do think it is worth noting that in my experience, not disciplining/training your dog can translate to not setting boundaries for your kids. Personally, I don\u2019t think there is anything more annoying than a dog/child that does whatever it wants \u2014 be it jumping on people and eating off people\u2019s plates or interrupting every conversation to say \u201clook at me\u201d and eating while jumping on the couch. \n \n Both groups benefit from (and want) some boundaries/discipline. \n \n Anonymous \n Right \u2014 the discipline that is appropriate to the species and to the temperament of the dog/child. That was the point of my original, long-ago comment, that the willingness to meet needs and enforce boundaries was predictive. Thanks for bringing it up. \n Hi, Carolyn: \n \n I do not like my father-in-law. He\u2019s rude, crass, obnoxious, argumentative and prone to flying into a rage over inconsequential matters. He also hugs me a bit too close and too long and has been caught looking at porn on our family computer. \n \n I haven\u2019t shared my feelings with my husband, because saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like your dad,\u201d just seems mean, and he\u2019s also aware of his dad\u2019s faults and works hard to make sure he never repeats them. \n \n How do I deal with my feelings during the inevitable family get-togethers? \n \n Spouse \n Share what needs family action. \u201cI don\u2019t like your dad\u201d is not useful information, but \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable around him\u201d is, when supported by specific examples. Also useful is noting that you both need to secure the family computer, and asking him for suggestions for dealing with the over-the-line hugs, assuming it\u2019s more than just a semiannual nuisance. Taking this approach will not only avoid adding needlessly to your husband\u2019s existing dad-burden, but it will be more honest than pretending you\u2019re okay with ol\u2019 Dad. As a bonus, it will help if you ever need to take a real stand on the dad\u2019s behavior. Make too much of a fuss over his merely being obnoxious, and your husband won\u2019t take you as seriously when you try to argue that his dad has crossed a serious line.

My dear mother always instructed me that it was rude to wear a hat indoors, and I am not suggesting that such rules have relaxed. However, as a professional working in New York, upon entering my office building I have to present my identification in order to pass through the security gates in the lobby (a wonderful addition in these post-9/11 times). Because I carry a briefcase, I have only one free hand with which to fish out my identification and press it against the gate in order to open it. Thus, I am left without a hand with which to carry my hat. What is a gentleman to do under these circumstances? My current custom is to leave my hat on my head until I\u2019ve passed through the security gate (even though this means wearing the hat into the building, up an escalator and across the lobby) and then, once I\u2019ve returned my identification to my pocket, remove my hat and hold it in my hand. GENTLE READER: If she were not a lady, and thus obliged to keep her hat on her head, Miss Manners would tip her hat to you for your desire to obey the letter of the law. But in this case, observing the spirit is sufficient. Gentlemen are allowed to keep their hats on as they travel through transitional spaces such as lobbies, corridors and airport esplanades. DEAR MISS MANNERS: I attended a wedding where the couple made a show of toasting each other with sparkling cider in elegant stemware. While this was lovely to behold, no festive beverage was provided for the guests to participate in any way. I understand this has become quite the tradition at weddings. I always thought when toasts were offered, everyone should be given the opportunity to participate. GENTLE READER: Perhaps that is because you thought that bridal couples cared about their wedding guests as guests, not to mention as family and friends. Why you should want to attend weddings of people who just want to assemble an audience, and assume that you should be thrilled to be allowed to look on, Miss Manners cannot imagine. DEAR MISS MANNERS: I have a co-worker who utilizes a wireless head-set in the bathroom, continuing her conversations with internal and external customers while completing her business. As she responds to the customer, we believe the line is not mute. My co-workers have tested the theory that you can hear everything, and the toilet flushing is loud and clear. How do we address this in a non-passive-aggressive manner? I find it very rude, and I can\u2019t imagine what our customers are thinking. GENTLE READER: Your concern that your co-worker is embarrassing the company is justifiable, but Miss Manners can see that you and your colleagues are having far too much fun with this. The original worker\u2019s behavior is a problem for the boss, and it should be raised to her in a general way: \u201cDo we have a policy on cellphone use when dealing with customers? There have been some reports of strange sounds in the background, and I was hoping we could all get some guidance.\u201d \n New Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on www.washingtonpost.com/advice .

So far, my experience hasn\u2019t been that great. I\u2019ve been so stressed out and had to go to the doctor several times because the stress is causing me to have bad headaches. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Since starting high school, I\u2019ve had breakdowns that I\u2019ve never ever had before. I\u2019ve looked into home schooling/online schooling and learned it isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019m afraid of asking or even bringing up home schooling to my parents because I feel they might laugh and say it\u2019s a very stupid idea since I\u2019m just a freshman or that they want me to have the \u201chigh school experience\u201d they did. What do I do? Please help me! -- Stressed Freshman DEAR STRESSED: Before dropping out of school entirely, you will need to notify all of the adults in your life about what is really going on with you, so that they can work together (and with you) to arrive at strategies for you to cope. If you are too afraid to go to your parents, you should start with another trusted adult (your school counselor and/or another friend or relative). There might be ways for you to adjust your school schedule for this year so it\u2019s a little easier on you. After-school groups or activities might give you a needed outlet. You should also have a thorough checkup by your physician to see if some physical problems might be at the root of some of your symptoms. A compassionate counselor could help you sort this out and give you tools for dealing with stress and anxiety in the future. DEAR AMY: When I got engaged last year, my now-husband and I went to visit his parents. His mother was gracious enough to present me with a lovely 2-carat diamond ring from her safe deposit box. She said she wanted me to have it because I love her son. I was thrilled because it meant acceptance into the family. I wore it every day, proud of the bond I share with my husband and new family. Unfortunately, six months ago I took it to get cleaned by a jeweler, who informed me that the diamond ring I loved so much was a fake. I was shocked. His parents are coming to visit next month. What shall I say when she doesn\u2019t see me wearing her ring? I don\u2019t want to seem like an ingrate and hurt her feelings, but at the same time I can\u2019t feel as proud of this ring as I once did and have stopped wearing it because I don\u2019t wish to go around accepting people\u2019s compliments on it. My husband says we will handle it when she visits and that surely she is unaware of the problem. I\u2019m disappointed with the situation (and in him too), but he doesn\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s that big of a deal, saying a happy marriage is what\u2019s important, not a piece of jewelry. Advice? -- Disappointed DEAR DISAPPOINTED: My first recommendation is for you to get a second opinion from another jeweler \u2014 and bring your husband with you. His mother should be told about this; it could have ramifications for her in other ways (she might need to get other pieces of jewelry professionally appraised). She may be embarrassed, but be honest, calm and understanding. Frankly, you do sound a little bit like an ingrate; this situation is no one\u2019s fault, and, real or fake, the ring still symbolizes (or should symbolize) the exact same thing it did when it was presented to you. DEAR AMY: More on unequal wills: I was on the nonreceiving end of my mother\u2019s will because my husband and I were financially very comfortable and my brother was strapped for money with children to support. You are correct, it wasn\u2019t about the money. Her siblings desperately tried to talk her into dividing her will equally between my brother and me, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. I hate that the wonderful woman who raised me now has left a bitter feeling in my heart.

That puts me in the generation who share nearly every part of our lives online, and though I don\u2019t have children of my own, I certainly enjoy the pictures and stories my peers post about their kids (who are too young for Facebook accounts). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The trouble is, where does the cute story end and the humiliation begin? Many of my friends with children post not only \u201ccross-eyed bear\u201d anecdotes, but stories of their sons and daughters being naughty or reckless (as toddlers will), and include details that, were I that child, I would not want to be public knowledge. It\u2019s known that most social media make up a permanent digital record. And even if future colleagues and friends don\u2019t find these stories, every adult the child grows up around will know them. Since these kids won\u2019t have access to their own online identity for several years, it\u2019s a very one-sided narrative indeed. I\u2019m not sure how to talk to the parents involved about my misgivings without seeming nosy or discouraging them from sharing their experiences raising children. GENTLE READER: The urge to rescue endangered children is a noble one, and Miss Manners agrees with you that these children are in danger of being embarrassed in years to come. As you point out, they are not yet old enough to embarrass themselves. However, this is not a form of cruelty that justifies outside interference. The most you can do is to say jokingly, \u201cWow, I bet his future bosses will enjoy seeing that.\u201d DEAR MISS MANNERS: My partner is in the military, and occasionally we find ourselves in the situation of having to go out on an errand with him in uniform. We have experienced the whole gamut of responses from strangers, from disapproving stares to adorable little children approaching us and boldly asking, \u201cDo you fight bad guys?\u201d Sometimes we get the standard \u201cThank you for your service,\u201d which he appreciates and responds to with \u201cThank you for saying thank you.\u201d Most of the reactions from strangers range from tolerable to endearing (to the mother of the boy who thought he was a superhero: Your son is adorable! May he never lose his sense of wonder). Sometimes people become a little too curious and ask where he has deployed to in the past, want to know exactly what it is he does in the military, when he will be shipping out again, etc. While these are conversations we routinely have with our friends and family, I don\u2019t think it is public information any stranger in a coffee shop should be badgering us for. What response would you recommend to terminate these conversations without sounding rude or dismissive? GENTLE READER: You are fortunate in that this form of intrusiveness, unlike the general nosiness that is rampant nowadays, starts from a premise of respect. Miss Manners is not suggesting that this requires your partner to enter into such conversations, only that he can draw on that respect to excuse himself. \u201cI\u2019m on leave, and I\u2019m afraid my time is limited\u201d or, \u201cPlease excuse me, but these are matters I\u2019d rather not discuss,\u201d he can say apologetically. \n New Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on www.washingtonpost.com/advice .

Two years ago my brother and his now-wife were preparing to get married and felt so much pressure, judgment and negativity from my parents leading up to the wedding that they almost uninvited them. That relationship has since repaired a bit, though there is still a lot of tension. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t My parents are now applying the screws to my relationship, my life and all of my decisions. They disapprove. Have resorted to screaming and yelling, angry 2 a.m. e-mails, and making it blatantly clear my significant other is unwelcome at holidays. They say, \u201cBut he\u2019s welcome! I think we were very civil to him when we saw him in August\u201d \u2014 but the \u201ccivility\u201d was palpable tension and anxiety.  I\u2019ve explained boundaries to them: that if this relationship DOES work, they\u2019re making it really stressful, and if it doesn\u2019t, I will distance myself super far away from them to avoid this type of intervention in the future. I\u2019m a happy, successful, person in my early 30s, and their attitude is a major negative force in my life. How do I make it go away without cutting them out? \u2014 Concerned \n\n \n\n I appreciate the idea of a boundary, but what you set down is not a boundary, it\u2019s a pair of consequences. Consequences are an important part of boundaries, which I\u2019ll get to in a second, but they need to be immediate, concrete and directed at the people whose invasiveness you\u2019re trying to thwart. One of your consequences is so deep into the future as to be nearly abstract: If your relationship doesn\u2019t work out \u2014 in however many months or years you give it to play out \u2014 then you\u2019ll move away? Imagine a mousetrap that snaps two years post-snatching of cheese. Your other consequence is \u201cmaking it really stressful\u201d \u2014 for you . So, they snatch the cheese, and you get snapped? A viable boundary involves a cause (their behavior), an effect (your response to their behavior), a clear statement of your position, and a direct consequence: Cause: \u201cMom, Dad \u2014 recently you\u2019ve responded to my choices with pressure, judgment and negativity, and you did a similar thing to Brother as he was planning his wedding.\u201d Effect: \u201cWhen you scream, yell and send me 2 a.m. e-mails, I feel stressed and [your other feelings here].\u201d Position: \u201cI will no longer discuss my relationship or my decisions with you \u2014 not until you\u2019re ready to trust that you raised me well enough to handle my own life, including any mistakes I make.\u201d Consequence: If they keep up the hysterics, you respond calmly and decisively by .\u2009.\u2009. hanging up the phone/leaving the room/deleting the e-mail/opting out of the family holiday. This gives your parents a chance to make an immediate connection \u2014 that if they impose their opinions on you when you haven\u2019t asked for them, then you will not stick around to be badgered. Better they learn this now, in low-conflict, single-encounter-size increments, than in your abrupt overseas relocation after years of bitter arguing. \n\n Dear Carolyn: My daughter is engaged. This will be her second marriage and her fiance\u2019s first. Her first wedding was a traditional, expensive affair that my wife and I paid for. We are wondering what we should be doing for her second wedding. We are approaching retirement and need to continue throwing money there. We have a son who will probably be getting married in a year or two and another son who hopefully will be following suit in the not-distant future. First marriages for both. My daughter is in her early 30s and the fiance is a year younger. \u2014 Anonymous \n\n \n\n Short answer: Do whatever you want. Slightly less short answer: Do what you can afford and think is fair to all your kids. Preachy answer: Don\u2019t let your opinion of marriage or remarriage influence your decision. When your kids are old enough to marry, they\u2019re old enough to be spared attempts at puppeteering by purse strings. Contingent answer: Hope she doesn\u2019t expect or ask you for anything and makes this whole question a moot point. Preemptive answer for other parents with a question like this in their future: Plan ahead, and not just financially. Also prepare yourselves philosophically by figuring out how you\u2019d handle a child who remarries or doesn\u2019t marry at all; or one who can afford to pay his or her own way vs. one who can\u2019t; or one whose vision of a tasteful wedding differs vastly from yours or from a previously married sibling\u2019s; or just different kids wanting or needing different things from you. We\u2019re all familiar with the power of unintended consequences, but unintended messages pack some serious power, too.

Since then, there have been a lot of strange goings-on. I\u2019ve come home multiple times (mostly at night) to find the door ajar. I asked that it remain closed for security reasons (we are on the ground floor), and now we can hear a steady stream of guests being buzzed in at all hours of the night. There is a mysterious lockbox on the fence, and there are sometimes strange people loitering outside the front door. We believe they are selling drugs. Our landlords have investigated the situation and haven\u2019t uncovered anything strange, but we aren\u2019t convinced. We don\u2019t want to confront them and risk creating an uneasy relationship, and I don\u2019t think we have enough evidence to take the issue to the police. Short of moving, what can we do about this? -- Wary Neighbor DEAR WARY: You don\u2019t have to fully investigate the goings-on in your building in order to call the police. Investigating is their job. It is hard to fathom why your landlord isn\u2019t curious about a \u201cmysterious lockbox\u201d on the fence outside your entrance. If there are groups of people gathering at the entrance and people coming and going at all hours, you should report this to the police and ask them to drive by to take a look. DEAR AMY: When my mother was dying, she asked a lifelong family friend to be like a sister to me because my own two siblings were always mean to me, and my mother knew they would continue to be after she was gone. The friend, an only child, was great for about four years, but then she stopped returning my calls and once went several months without contacting me. Every time I want to go home, she is conveniently unable to see me and she tells me whoppers about her guest room being unavailable. I have known her since I was a baby and have listened to petty criticisms of people we both know without comment. When I told her I really wanted to come home after many years away and said I needed a connection because I am totally alone, her response was, \u201cGet used to it.\u201d I live in another state and have friends but wanted to maintain a hometown connection. How should I handle this? Why did she make the promise to my mother if she was not going to keep it? It is heartbreaking because I have no family ties left. -- Heartbroken DEAR HEARTBROKEN: It is a tough truth to impart, but I have to tell you now that nobody owes you anything. People make promises and break them. You may feel wounded, hurt, upset and depleted, but you simply cannot make someone give you what she doesn\u2019t want to give. Your job in life is to look after yourself and to find ways to get what you need \u2014 emotionally and otherwise \u2014 so that you live your best possible life, without being mired in anger and hurt over the past. And so now you need to let it go. Find a way to move on. If you don\u2019t have any family members to rely on, you\u2019ll have to create your own family from healthy relationships with friends. DEAR AMY: I am somewhat unsettled by your response to \u201cRested but Concerned.\u201d Chronic insomnia is a condition that is not so easily solved with earplugs and separate mattresses. Many other conditions contribute to this illness. It seems that punishing the mother by insisting that she return to bed with her husband is just another way of \u201ccaving to the 10-year-old\u2019s demand\u201d and validating the father\u2019s hypothetical spiteful behavior. -- Sweet Dreams DEAR SWEET DREAMS: Other readers also expressed your point of view. One solution might be for this mother to start out in the marriage bed and then move to another room later in order to sleep more soundly. I assume we all agree that the child should not co-sleep with the father. \n Amy\u2019s column appears seven days a week at www.washingtonpost.com/advice .

Last summer, my niece and nephew both participated in travel sports, which took up nearly every weekend. \n \n I know each family should do what is best for them, but this affects our entire family. Our parents are getting older and really cherish seeing all of us together. I tried to put together a Mother\u2019s Day brunch, but it was the first tournament of the year for both kids. For our parents\u2019 55th anniversary, my sister said the best they could do is a family dinner on a Tuesday. \n \n I wish I could explain to her that fitness and sports are important, but she is encouraging her kids to sacrifice family time. My own kids are in sports, too, but they are not nearly to this level of crazed involvement. \n \n Should I discuss this issue with her, or try to let it go? How much should I visit my parents to make up for her absence? \n \n Sister Overbooks \n Please stop making this about your sister\u2019s priorities. Judging her will only escalate this into a much deeper, more hurtful feud. Not to mention guarantee that one of your children will blossom into a surprising talent at some Time Consuming Pursuit, and you will be snacking on your current outrage till your own 55th. Instead, ask your sister to join you, calendars in hand, in finding dates when the whole family can get together. Even without travel athletes, it\u2019s typical for three separate families to have a hard time lining up their free time, and that gives you two choices: You can insist on special dates and open yourself to all kinds of frustration, or you can embrace the idea that sometimes Christmas will be in January and your parents\u2019 anniversary will come a month late. You, after all, in a way are sacrificing family time by insisting that you honor your mother only on Mother\u2019s Day instead of choosing a workable date. \n Re: Sister: \n \n But it really means one family essentially controls the dates because they are SO booked. We specifically keep a few weekends free to catch up on errands, relax, etc., but my family member gets annoyed when we don\u2019t jump at the few days (hours) his family is actually available outside of their sports commitments. Frustrating! \n \n Anonymous \n Sure, the busier people do drive the schedule, but that\u2019s just life, and the bigger person doesn\u2019t bean-count. Think about it \u2014 some pursuits are more time-consuming than others. Is that cause for judging? Some families have more kids and therefore more stuff on their calendars. Is that cause for judging? Some people enjoy active weekends more than they do relaxing. Is that cause for judging? It\u2019s no-win, so I strongly advise no-play. In your case, the problem isn\u2019t overbooking, it\u2019s your family member\u2019s annoyance, which is bean-counting, as well. Dropping the huffiness is his bigger-person prescription, and he\u2019s not taking it. Still, the response to that is to say, \u201cHey, we all do what we can \u2014 we\u2019ll make it work next time.\u201d Never pass up a chance to pass up a chance at a peeing contest. \n Write to Carolyn Hax, Style, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071, or tellme@washpost.com .

I am pretty sure that these cuts were the results of self-harm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t As soon as she noticed me looking at them, she covered her arm. I haven\u2019t said anything to her yet. She seems like a happy person with loving parents and supportive friends. I don\u2019t think that there is anyone bullying her (and we have a really small school, so I would know). She is generally liked and is popular. This is really worrying me, and I don\u2019t know how to handle it. I don\u2019t know if I should tell her, and if so how. Please help me to help her. -- Worried Friend DEAR WORRIED: A person can seem happy and healthy on the outside and still be insecure, anxious or in pain. You simply never really know what people are going through. The reason some people cut themselves is because they are trying to find ways to cope with feelings that are otherwise unexpressed. You should notify your school counselor about this. If it\u2019s not treated, self-harm (\u201ccutting\u201d) can progress and become even more serious. You are a very good friend to notice this and want to help; seeking help for a friend is the first step toward her healing. DEAR AMY: Two of my close friends just broke up, and I\u2019m looking for advice on how to deal with the aftermath. The breakup wasn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d \u2014 no fighting, screaming or bad-mouthing. But I still feel stuck in the middle because they\u2019re extremely uncomfortable and depressed around each other. I met these two at the exact same time (not an exaggeration \u2014 on the first day of college, we were standing next to one another in a line). There is no way I can, or would even want to, pick sides. The problem is that our friend-groups are exactly the same, and I can\u2019t think of a way of hanging out with one without the other finding out. I can\u2019t simply invite one and not the other with any hope of keeping it a secret. I\u2019m really at a loss: These two people are my closest friends in the world, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to weather the storm without making things worse. -- Stuck DEAR STUCK: Your primary job is to be honest with both friends and to cope with your own discomfort \u2014 not to change your behavior or act against your instincts to shield them from their discomfort. This is an awkward situation and will remain so until everybody settles down. Tell both friends: \u201cI know this is tough on you, but it\u2019s hard for your friends too. I\u2019m going to do my best to spend time with each of you, but I hope you will figure out a way to hang out together with the group.\u201d If you choose to spend time with one friend, and the other wants you to be exclusionary, you\u2019ll have to spell it out that you care about them equally and won\u2019t be pressured to choose between them. DEAR AMY: Your advice (about unequal bequests) to take care of family in the kindest way hit a nerve with me. My mother, in her mid-90s and of sound mind, cannot grasp the \u201cemotional equity\u201d concept of your advice. After the death of my only sibling several years ago, my mom has redone her trust twice, the latest in an effort to leave out my nephew for the indiscretion of not phoning often enough. She is about to have her first great-grandchild. If this baby is given \u201cthe right name,\u201d he or she will be written into the trust. I have brought up the inequity subject twice over the course of a few years and realized it was of no value. To inoculate my children, just in case they were expecting anything, I have told them that grandma will not be leaving anything for them in her will. To their credit, they remain loving and giving toward her (as do I). -- Frustrated Daughter DEAR DAUGHTER: Preparing your children for this legacy inequity (and carrying on regardless) is the right thing to do. \n Amy\u2019s column appears seven days a week at www.washingtonpost.com/advice .

Here is what some of you had to say: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Agnes in West Sacramento, Calif.: \u201cI used the herb ginger root to calm the stomach: two capsules a half-hour to an hour before the trip started. Then another capsule every hour or whenever I started to feel queasy.\u201d Dave, via e-mail: \u201cMy cure for motion sickness: Suck on a lemon. It worked for me as a child while riding miles in a car. It now works for my grandchildren.\u201d Grandma J., via e-mail: \u201cDid you forget ginger snaps? They taste so good. Kids love them, and they do help relieve the symptoms of motion sickness.\u201d Robert Beyer, MD, in California: \u201cAs an ophthalmologist, I sometimes have patients with this problem. Some of them obtain relief if they close or cover one of their eyes. It seems that in some individuals, motion sickness is a three-dimension motional perception problem. Restricting vision to one eye while the difficulty is occurring seems to benefit these individuals.\u201d Thank you all for writing. Most people know about ginger (in any form) to help settle a queasy stomach, but I sure never thought about closing one eye! -- Heloise TRAVEL HINT Dear Heloise: We recently got back from a trip, and I wanted to share some travel tips. Bring a jersey dress that you can accent with great accessories and wear out to dinner your first night, then let it become your beach cover-up/ bathrobe for the rest of the trip. On our trip, I bought some earrings that were delicate, and I was afraid they\u2019d get squished out of shape. For the flight home, I put them in the empty boxes of my pillbox. I was so impressed with the idea, I moved all my earrings into that container! -- Lisa C., Colorado Springs, Colo. WINDSHIELD CLEANING Dear Heloise: Cleaning the inside of the windshield is a contortionist\u2019s dream. I just learned that by wearing latex gloves, I have a better and easier grip on paper towels. -- Garry in Huber Heights, Ohio LEAF BLOWER Dear Heloise: I cringe every fall, seeing my neighbors blow or rake their leaves into the gutters, which clogs the drain systems. Almost worse are the many plastic bags full of leaves left for trucks to take to the landfills. Hasn\u2019t everyone gotten the memo by now about plastic bags? If your disposal company will not accept loose leaves in a garbage can, one large bag can be filled, then the leaves inside crushed and condensed and used for compost in flower beds. Leaves (and grass clippings) make excellent mulches and fertilizers. -- Lynn in Colorado Springs, Colo. MICROWAVE TURNTABLE Dear Heloise: Here is another use for microwave turntables: Find a place mat that matches your decor. Trim it to fit under the turntable, and place it on the floor to hold your pet\u2019s dishes. The rim will contain crumbs and spills. -- G.

I am from a family that is comfortable financially, and I have zero debt. I make reasonable money for an above-entry-level job and live within those means. \n \n \n My boyfriend moved here six months ago for two reasons \u2014 to stop being a ski bum, and to be with me (a bit of a spontaneous decision on his part). \n \n When he moved here, he was underemployed and working food service. I paid more than my share of our expenses (dinners, concert tickets), but grew resentful when it seemed like he was making decent money but was always tight-fisted. \n \n About three months in, he said he wanted to live together. The main motivation seemed to be financial, which I found offensive. However, I have come to realize that in addition to significant student loans, he has almost $8,000 in medical and credit card debt (from a skiing accident and from moving here, respectively). \n \n I revisited the idea of living together. We spend basically every night together anyway, it almost seems silly to be paying rent in two places. He has also managed to get a full-time, salaried position with benefits, and is still working food service on weekends. \n \n Still, I feel slightly torn. I love this man who moved here to be with me, but at the same time, the idea of building a future with someone with such massive financial liabilities is daunting. The student loans and medical bills are one thing, but I find credit card debt un-stomachable. Is it simply too soon to do something so radical for someone I\u2019ve only been dating six months? \n Moving in as a sensible money decision is a terrible emotional decision. There is inertia in sharing an address; as I\u2019ve said before, moving in is fun and exciting but moving out is depressing, painful and hard. When moving out is hard, people stay together who would otherwise break up. When people stay together for reasons other than being happy together, regrets ensue. It\u2019ll never be easier to say \u201cno\u201d than it is now, while \u201cyes,\u201d if it\u2019s the right answer, will stay on the table. Meanwhile, for a new couple, one of the biggest challenges is to keep your bearings amid the excitement of attraction and future promise. You, at your core, balked at moving in. Trust that \u2014 by trusting, if its promise is real, that the relationship will withstand his effort to get out of debt in his own time. Don\u2019t throw things out of balance by trying to take on his debts as your responsibility. That\u2019s for a time of deeper commitment, not for \u201cI love this man who moved here to be with me.\u201d (Which part is it that you love?) About that debt: Credit card debt is among the more troubling kinds, yes, but a onetime encounter with it can be a lesson learned. Plus, he\u2019s working it off, right? Plus, you\u2019ve never faced the choices he faced. So watch where the debt story goes, recommend the National Foundation for Credit Counseling , and judge not. You apparently love each other, you\u2019re growing closer, and you\u2019re both making good/better financial choices.

I have twice passed up the opportunity to apply for a promotion I likely would have received. My peers, staff and many of our organization\u2019s supporters would like to see me in that role and have encouraged me to go for it. The time requirements for the position are demanding, and my personal schedule just can\u2019t accommodate those demands. I have a toddler, and my husband has an unsual schedule; taking such a position would require me to hire a babysitter several times a week, which I\u2019m not willing to do. All that aside, simply put: I\u2019m happy doing what I do now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Although I have told people I am content in my current role, I am being \u201cgroomed\u201d for future opportunities, and when my situation changes, I may be open to them. Yet people express dismay at my present lack of desire to advance. When I mention my child or my schedule, I am met with groans and looks of scornful disappointment, and suggestions to hire a nanny or move closer to work. How can I tactfully put this situation to rest? \n\n Karla: \u201cI\u2019m waiting until Spike is in kindergarten,\u201d with a smile, followed by a change of subject. Bonus points if Spike is a girl. You\u2019re a parent with a full-time day job. You have every right to decline to take on more \u2014 no matter how many helpful suggestions you receive on how to upend your budget and living situation to suit someone else\u2019s idea of where you should be. End of story. \n\n Althouuuuugh ... it sounds as if you\u2019re a bit of a rock star at work. That might give you leverage to make any promotion meet your requirements \u2014 not the other way around. Let\u2019s dream: What would help that promotion work for you? A transition period working part time in the new role? Working from home? Dedicated administrative support? Your choice of focus? Maybe management would turn those down \u2014 or maybe it would find a way to make them happen for a rock star. I know you don\u2019t need anyone telling you which direction to lean. And I\u2019m not trying to. It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t get past this study by Hewlett-Packard I read about, showing that women applied for openings only if they thought they were 100 percent qualified. Meanwhile, their male colleagues went after jobs they felt at least 60 percent qualified for. You know better than I what this job requires and what you can currently offer. But when your situation changes, who knows if the opportunity will still be there? Often, the only opportunities we\u2019re 100 percent ready for are ones we\u2019ve already outgrown. \n\n Karla L.

We hit it off immediately and began a wild sexual relationship. I go to her huge home every day and spend the day in bed with her, as I lost my job last year and can\u2019t seem to find another one. She gives me hundreds of dollars in cash every week (which she calls \u201cpocket change\u201d), and I\u2019m saving lots of money for my retirement. The problem is I\u2019m feeling guilty about the whole situation, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m being used. She insists that she loves me. Should I end this relationship while I still have a little pride or should I keep taking her money until I have enough to buy a home and move to Florida? -- Confused DEAR CONFUSED: Why is this woman giving you so much money? Is it because you won\u2019t see her unless she pays you? Does she need to have power and control over you? Or is it because she loves you and is being generous? If you don\u2019t like being a gigolo, then stop acting like one. Before accepting the next weekly wad of cash, you should ask her what her motivation is. If you are in a relationship with someone who loves you (and you don\u2019t love her), and this doesn\u2019t feel right, perhaps you should return the money, reclaim your pride and find another way to get yourself to Florida. If you are spending every day in bed with her, this would seriously impede your job search. DEAR AMY: After a decade of trying to no avail to get my husband to participate in our marriage, I\u2019ve decided to call it quits. The problem is that I am the breadwinner, and it would ruin us financially to split up. We have a child in high school with some learning disabilities and social issues. I doubt she will be ready to fly the nest any time soon. I was advised by a family law attorney not to divorce for these reasons. My husband and I are mostly friends but haven\u2019t shared an intimate relationship on any level for 10 years. I stopped wearing my wedding ring and moved to another bedroom a few months ago. My plan is to remain married and living in the home but to go my own way. How do I explain this change in our relationship to friends and family? I am at peace with this decision and, in fact, am feeling unstuck and hopeful for the future for the first time in many years. -- Looking Ahead DEAR LOOKING AHEAD: Your friends and family (and your daughter) have probably noticed that you have stopped wearing your wedding ring. This gives you an opportunity to say that you and your husband are separating but have decided to continue to cohabit peacefully and co-parent your daughter. A mediator or professional counselor could help you and your husband. But there is nothing to stop your husband from seeing a lawyer; he could also initiate a divorce, split up the household and ruin you financially. You should plan ahead. DEAR AMY: \u201cLoving Mom\u201d wrote to you about her ex-husband, who is in and out of jail and recently violated their \u201cno contact\u201d court order by sending their young daughter a birthday card. While your advice was compassionate, you made a mistake when you told this mother to notify the ex that he should contact only her (and not the child). If he contacts her, she is inviting him to violate this court order. -- Concerned Reader DEAR READER: You are right. \u201cLoving Mom\u201d said her ex was not aware of the court order. I suggested that she notify him of the order and send him a copy. You are correct that for him to contact her (as I suggested he should) would be in violation; better advice would have been for me to suggest that he only go through his (or her) lawyer if he wanted to be in touch with either the mother or the child.

I\u2019m not a prude, but it makes me feel very uncomfortable. The last straw was when I received my wedding photos a few weeks ago and was dismayed to find many pictures where my in-laws were kissing and making googly eyes at each other in our wedding party (bridesmaids and groomsmen) pictures. Looking at them you would wonder why my husband and I were wearing the bride and groom\u2019s attire instead of them. I really want to say something without hurting their feelings too much, but my husband is convinced they don\u2019t know what they are doing. We are all in our late 20s and early 30s, so there is no chance that they will grow out of this behavior. GENTLE READER: You mean that they look like newlyweds, and yet will never outgrow that stage? Miss Manners finds that a rather charmingly optimistic view of marriage. It is not charming to watch, however. Prudery \u2014 so common a charge that you anticipate it \u2014 has nothing to do with it. Watching people kiss (and more) on film constitutes a great deal of our so-called entertainment. The reason that onlookers dislike this in life is because it is clear that the loving couple is not interested in others, to the extent of pretending that they are not there. Do not seat them next to each other at dinner, where couples should be separated anyway, for variety of conversation. Elsewhere, a slightly more polite way of saying \u201cget a room,\u201d at least among visiting relatives, is, \u201cIt\u2019s all right if you want to go home now and be alone.\u201d And to keep from going bonkers, stay off their Facebook pages. DEAR MISS MANNERS: During the offertory collection at my church, some form of religious musical performance takes place. It may be the choir, a soloist (vocal or instrumental) or the bell choir. At the conclusion of the performance the entire congregation applauds as though they are at a concert. To me this borders on being sacrilegious. Is this acceptable behavior? Wouldn\u2019t it be more appropriate to compliment the performers individually and informally after the service? Is this a common practice in other churches? GENTLE READER: It is, alas, increasingly common for people to regard everything as a source of entertainment. Miss Manners is grateful that you recognize that church music is indeed intended for the glory of God, not the pleasure of worshippers. Praise for the performers may certainly be delivered after the service, but it should not be allowed to interrupt praise for God. \n New Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on www.washingtonpost.com/advice .

Do you have any hints on how we can keep our carved pumpkins lasting longer? -- Paige L. in California \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Here are two hints to help preserve carved pumpkins. The first thing to do, once a pumpkin is carved, is to coat all the cut areas and the inside of the pumpkin with petroleum jelly to help prevent moisture loss. Don\u2019t forget under the lid! The other method you can use is to mix water with a tablespoon or so of bleach in a 16-ounce spray bottle. Spray the pumpkin every day to help keep it from drying out and prevent the growth of any mold, which is very important. Enjoy your pumpkins, and happy Halloween! -- Heloise P.S.: They don\u2019t last long, so take photos! SNAP A PICTURE Dear Heloise: I work at a resort in Maui, Hawaii. Sometimes parents get carried away and lose track of their child. When they come to me for help, I ask them if they have a picture on their phone from that day. That way, you can forward it to all the security people, and they will know exactly what the child is wearing and what he or she looks like. So, every time you go out in public, snap a picture for safekeeping, just in case. -- Kawika in Maui, Hawaii Brilliant! This should be a hint for all parents and grandparents for any outing!

My boyfriend is thinking of getting back in touch with a friend of his who was an alcoholic who self-destructed and refused help \u2014 at which point my boyfriend ended his friendship with him. \n \n I do not want an alcoholic in my life. I can\u2019t see how this is a good idea, and I\u2019m not comfortable with this at all. \n \n Vetoing \n Er, major piece of information missing: Has the friend since gotten sober, or he still abusing? Be careful, too, how you throw those absolutes around. \u201cI do not want an alcoholic in my life\u201d is the kind of thing that inspires people to say, \u201cI do not want judgmental people in my life.\u201d Someone who gets and stays sober is still an alcoholic; is that person also unworthy of you? \n Re: Veto: \n \n No, it is not okay to veto one of your significant other\u2019s friendships. The only thing it is okay to do is to remove yourself from situations you don\u2019t want to be in. You cannot control anything another person does/says/thinks. I believe this is Rule No. 1 of Hax. And to quote Monty Python: Rule 2, same as Rule 1. \n \n Anonymous \n Yep, that, thanks. You do have the right, in exceptional situations, to object strenuously (reference to a different kind of cinematic comedy) to a friendship and ask your partner to end it. The classic example is someone with whom your partner cheated on you, or someone else who deliberately tried to harm you or the relationship. If you are not personally injured by this objectionable friend, then I see the bar as pretty high \u2014 abuse, for example. Child pornography. Animal cruelty. Of course, when you get to any of these points, you\u2019re often right back to \u201cremove yourself from situations you don\u2019t want to be in,\u201d relationships included. \n Re: Veto: \n \n Just because the boyfriend is going to see his former friend, doesn\u2019t mean Vetoing needs to. Do they not ever socialize apart? \n \n Anonymous 2 \n True. However, if experience says that an innocent-sounding \u201cgoing to see his former friend\u201d will quickly morph into receiving wee-hours phones calls to bail out a still-drinking alcoholic friend, then I think a little leeway on this is fair. For the last word, I\u2019m throwing in a third movie reference: \u201cYou\u2019ll never be a first-class human being .\u2009.\u2009. until you\u2019ve learned to have some regard for human frailty.\u201d \n\n\n \n Dear Carolyn: \n \n My father recently passed away. My adult stepdaughter, who has always been somewhat of a challenge, has known my father just about all her life, and texted me a message of condolence. I am having a hard time with that. I know she is of the \u201csocial media\u201d generation, but isn\u2019t that taking it a bit too far? \n \n Stepparent \n I could easily agree, but instead I urge you not to look for reasons to be disappointed in people. You will always, always find them. Instead, please look for reasons to be grateful: Your always-challenging stepdaughter thought of you and expressed her sympathy. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n Write to Carolyn Hax, Style, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071, or tellme@washpost.com .

I recently watched my dear friend fall apart when her husband died unexpectedly and then I saw her family almost go under finan\u00adcially. Now I wonder if and when I should talk to my own kids about my savings, my IRAs and my life insurance in case we ever have some kind of terrible family emergency. \u00b6 Somehow, money is a challenging topic for me, and now I don\u2019t know whether I should tell my teenagers about my finances \u2014 and possibly scare them witless \u2014 or just do my yoga, take my vitamins and keep my mouth shut. \n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t A Before you say anything, you need to think a little differently. It isn\u2019t \u201cmy finances;\u201d it\u2019s \u201cour finances.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Once you have children, any money you make goes into the family pie and that pie belongs to all of you. And because it belongs to all of you, your children have the right to know approximately how much money you make unless, of course, you make so much money \u2014 or so little money \u2014 that you don\u2019t think they can handle that information too well. \n\n Your children should also know whether you have any property besides the house that you live in and the car that you drive, and whether you own any stocks. Even if you don\u2019t own any stocks, you can teach your children about the market by having the whole family read the business pages together for a week or two and then by each of you pretending to buy a stock that looks promising. Write down the price of each stock on the day that you bought it and every day thereafter for a couple of weeks so you\u2019ll know whose stock has risen the most. The winner then gets to tell the family what stock to buy (or pretend to buy). As you watch it rise and fall and, with luck, rise again, your teens will learn how the stock market works. This exercise will help your children understand the power of money, but it won\u2019t make them understand the uses of money unless you have them put 10 percent of their allowance into the family\u2019s poor box every week \u2014 for those who have less than they do \u2014 and to save another 10 percent as their cushion when times get tough. Pride is another good teacher, and your teens will be full of it when they open their own savings and checking accounts and learn how to balance their checkbooks and pay a few bills online before they go to college. \n You also should tell your teens how much life insurance you have and how it works. Your teens should know that they\u2019ll be buying their own insurance one day, and that the right policy will let them draw out some of the money if they get in a jam or need money to pay toward a big tuition bill or the birth of a baby or the down payment on a house. \n\n It may seem like you\u2019ll be giving your teens way too much financial information, but this is what they will need if you die before they do. With this possibility in mind, you should also tell your children the names of your lawyer and your insurance agent and where you keep your will and any other important papers. These papers should include your living will, in case you can\u2019t make critical medical decisions yourself, and, \n\n if you decide to have one, \n\n a broader order called the DNR ( \n\n Do Not Resuscitate), which your doctor will sign after consulting with you. Th e other papers include your health-care power of attorney with the name of someone who will make medical decisions for you and a durable power of attorney, so they\u2019ll know who should handle your financial affairs. This is a difficult thing to talk about, and none of this will be easy to explain to your teens, even though they\u2019re almost grown, but it\u2019s unfair to keep them in the dark. Too little information can be much harder on children than too much of it. It would even be good to tuck your funeral instructions in with your papers, although it will probably be years before you\u2019ll need \u2014 or want \u2014 to talk about them. \n\n 8 \n Family Almanac archive Read past columns on the Advice page in the Lifestyle section, where you can also find columns by Carolyn Hax, Ask Amy and Miss Manners. \n\n 8 \n Going Out Guide Find kid-friendly events in your area at goingoutguide.com/kids . \n\n 8 \n On Parenting Visit the blog each weekday for news and advice: washingtonpost.com/onparenting .", "topics": ["lifestyle", "advice"], "author": "Marguerite Kelly", "wordCount": 780}, {"date": "2013-10-29 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Ask Amy: Ask Amy: Young mom wonders if she should stick out relationship", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636604/s/3313f551/sc/36/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cstyle0Cask0Eamy0Eyoung0Emom0Ewonders0Eif0Eshe0Eshould0Estick0Eout0Erelationship0C20A130C10A0C220C62df64b80E380Ab0E11e30Eae460Ee4248e75c8ea0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iadvice/story01.htm", "text": "DEAR AMY: Last year I met my boyfriend. I became pregnant quickly in the relationship, and now we have a baby together. I was never completely satisfied with the relationship, but he was such a caring person that I\u2019ve tried to see it through. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t He has intense religious views that I just don\u2019t share. He originally lived an hour away but has since moved in with my mother and myself, and we all take care of the baby. I\u2019m still not satisfied with the relationship. Anything physical is completely undesirable to me. He\u2019s a good person, but he lacks initiative and any sort of drive to make himself better, even for our daughter. He cares about us both deeply, but I just don\u2019t have the feelings I think I should have for him. I also never wanted to raise a baby, but with so much pressure from him and his family I felt that there was no other way (I was interested in adoption). I now love my baby girl with my whole heart but just can\u2019t get past this distant feeling I have for him. I don\u2019t want to tell him I feel this way because I think he would be crushed, but I also don\u2019t want to spend my whole life not being entirely happy because of a slip-up I had at age 20. Should I try to stick it out or should I tell him the truth? -- Wondering DEAR WONDERING: Your primary and most important job is to be your baby\u2019s mother. This needs to come above your romantic dreams at this point. From the way you describe it, it sounds as if your boyfriend is a good person and involved dad. If he is available to be the primary caregiver in your mother\u2019s home for now (it sounds as if he is), you could pursue your education, job training or whatever outside goals you have. You are very young, and it is natural at your age to want to be \u201centirely happy.\u201d But happiness comes in many forms, and for the first year or so of your daughter\u2019s life you may have to shelve youthful happiness in favor of the satisfaction that you are doing the best thing for your child. If after six to nine more months you know you cannot make it with your boyfriend as a romantic partner, you will have to act like a responsible adult and be honest, kind and respectful as you both work out what will be best for your daughter. Eventually, you may determine that your child could do best living with the child\u2019s father and his family, with you co-parenting as you can. DEAR AMY: The mother of my young grandson \u2014 she\u2019s not married to my son \u2014 is charming and bright but lies constantly. Often the lies are about insignificant issues. She is in her early 20s. I hate to think of my grandson growing up with this role model. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach her, especially as she is a very defensive person? -- Worried Grandma DEAR GRANDMA: If this young woman lies directly to you and you catch her, then you get to call her on it. (If she lies to other people, they, not you, should respond.) The only way to do this is honestly, knowing in advance that this young mother may not respond well and it might not affect her behavior. You say, \u201cI\u2019m concerned and confused because what you are saying just isn\u2019t true. How would you feel if I wasn\u2019t honest with you? How would you feel if your little boy wasn\u2019t honest with you?\u201d DEAR AMY: \u201cConcerned Suitemate\u201d had to tolerate one guy airing his personal business through nightly Skype calls to his girlfriend in the common area. It would make much more sense for the roommates to just hand some headphones to Skyping guy and say plainly, \u201cUse these. We\u2019re tired of hearing your personal stuff.

Cohen agreed to pay $1.2\u00a0billion to settle charges that it tolerated rampant insider trading for more than a decade, a deal that could sink one of Wall Street\u2019s big success stories and crush its owner\u2019s vaunted reputation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t SAC Capital Advisors agreed to plead guilty to each of the five counts in a criminal indictment unveiled in July by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The Connecticut-based firm would stop managing the money of outside investors if the deal is approved by the courts. It can continue to manage Cohen\u2019s sizeable fortune, but would have to do so under the eye of an independent compliance consultant. The plea agreement, announced Monday, marks the culmination of a multi-year effort to close in on a storied hedge fund that has racked up stellar profits since Cohen founded it in 1992. It also represents one of the most high-profile successes in the government\u2019s aggressive push to purge Wall Street of insider trading and hold wrongdoers accountable. Since Bharara took office in August 2009, he has filed insider-trading charges against 87 defendants and convicted 75 of them \u2014 including hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, who is now behind bars, and his friend Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs board member who was found guilty of divulging boardroom secrets to Rajaratnam. Under Monday\u2019s deal, SAC agreed to pay $900\u00a0million in fines and forfeit an additional $900\u00a0million, for a total of $1.8\u00a0billion, a record for an insider- trading case. But the firm will receive a $616\u00a0million credit for civil settlements it reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March involving alleged insider trading at two SAC affiliates. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of SAC as the markets have come to know it,\u201d said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor and a former SEC enforcement lawyer. \u201cToday\u2019s plea will kick the pedestal out from under Cohen\u2019s long-enjoyed lofty status on Wall Street.\u201d In a statement, SAC said that it takes responsibility for the \u201chandful of men\u201d who have pleaded guilty to insider trading while at the firm. Early in the day, SAC\u2019s statement said that it \u201chas never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading.\u201d That language disappeared in the afternoon and the statement instead said: \u201cEven one person crossing the line into illegal behavior is too many and we greatly regret this conduct occurred.\u201d None of the cases that the government has settled with the hedge fund accuse Cohen of criminal wrongdoing. But he remains a target of a separate civil proceeding by the SEC, which recently charged him with failing to supervise two of the firm\u2019s employees in insider-trading incidents. If the SEC wins, Cohen might be banned from the industry for life. On Monday, Bharara implied that Cohen remains in his office\u2019s crosshairs, too, saying that the plea agreement does not provide criminal protection or immunity for any individuals. Bharara described the deal as a \u201cfair but steep\u201d resolution.   \u201cNo institution should rest easy in the belief that it is too big to jail,\u201d Bharara said when announcing the agreement. \u201cThat is a moral hazard that a just society can ill afford.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The deal is likely to eat into the considerable wealth amassed by Cohen, whose net worth is estimated at $9 billion by Forbes magazine. None of the $1.8 billion will be paid by outside investors, which means that Cohen or his various entities must pony up the cash, according to legal experts tracking the case. All the funds will go to the U.S. Treasury, Bharara said. Investors have pulled billions of dollars in recent months from Cohen\u2019s hedge fund, which managed $15 billion in assets at its peak. Nearly all the money left over belongs to Cohen. When prosecutors announced the criminal charges leveled against SAC in July, Bharara described the hedge fund as a \u201cveritable magnet for market cheaters.\u201d The indictment portrayed a pressure-cooker culture that encouraged illegal tips in the quest for profits. Bharara said SAC \u201cseeded itself\u201d with corrupt traders and then turned a blind eye to suspicious activity, which is why he went after the company, not just its employees. In the past few years, eight SAC employees have either been accused or convicted of insider trading that took place from 1999 through 2010. Five have pleaded guilty, and two \u2014 Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg \u2014 are fighting the allegations in court. Prosecutors say the hedge fund failed to detect any of the employees\u2019 misconduct. It even hired Richard Lee despite warnings that he had been involved in an \u201cinsider trading group\u201d at his prior firm, prosecutors said. Only once in its history did SAC identify possible insider trading at its firm, the indictment said. But it did not fire the individuals involved or report the matter to federal authorities. Prosecutors did not mention Cohen by name in the indictment. But they said that the corrupt employees at times recommended trades to the \u201cSAC owner\u201d based on illegal tips. Tying Cohen directly to insider trading has proved elusive, in part because none of the current or former employees charged turned on him. Now, all eyes are on Steinberg and Martoma, who face trial in mid-November and January, respectively. \u201cThe people who testified against Rajaratnam were lifetime friends,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School. \u201cBut people facing years in prison can give up on friendships.\u201d", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Dina ElBoghdady", "wordCount": 885}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334d5b96/sc/2/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cbusiness0Ceconomy0C20A130C110C0A40Cf0Ab611a0A0E459f0E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Lydia DePillis", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Wonkblog: The best sentences we read today", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334c8d5f/sc/38/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cezra0Eklein0Cpost0Cthe0Ebest0Esentences0Ewe0Eread0Etoday0C20A130C110C0A40C864c5a960E45ad0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Brad Plumer", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Johnson &#38; Johnson agrees to pay $2.2 billion in drug-marketing settlement", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334a987c/sc/3/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cnational0Chealth0Escience0Cjohnson0Eand0Ejohnson0Eagrees0Eto0Epay0E220Ebillion0Ein0Edrug0Emarketing0Esettlement0C20A130C110C0A40Ca70A923420E456a0E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "Johnson & Johnson will pay $2.2\u00a0billion to resolve civil and criminal allegations involving the marketing of off-label, unapproved uses for three prescription drugs, Justice Department officials announced Monday. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The cases, which date from the late 1990s through the early 2000s, involve alleged kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies to promote the antipsychotic drugs Risperdal and Invega, and a heart drug, Natrecor. The widely anticipated agreement was one of the largest health-care fraud settlements in U.S. history.  Federal investigators accused a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary of promoting Risperdal for controlling anxiety and aggression in elderly dementia patients, as well as for treating behavioral problems in other \u201cvulnerable\u201d populations, such as children and the mentally disabled, even though the Food and Drug Administration initially approved the drug only for schizophrenia. Officials said the company also promoted off-label uses for Invega and \u201cmade false and misleading statements about its safety and efficacy.\u201d In addition, Justice officials said another Johnson & Johnson subsidiary undertook an \u201caggressive campaign\u201d to market Natrecor for some patients with less severe heart disease than the drug was designed to treat. Monday\u2019s settlement included criminal fines and forfeited profits of about $485\u00a0million, as well as civil payments to the federal government and various states totaling more than $1.7\u00a0billion, the Justice Department said. \u201cThe conduct at issue in this case jeopardized the health and safety of patients and damaged the public trust,\u201d Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in announcing the settlement. \u201cThis multibillion-dollar resolution demonstrates the Justice Department\u2019s firm commitment to preventing and combating all forms of health-care fraud. And it proves our determination to hold accountable any corporation that breaks the law and enriches its bottom line at the expense of the American people.\u201d The deal also marked the latest in a string of high-profile fraud settlements that the government has sought against the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. The Justice Department said it has recovered nearly $17\u00a0billion since 2009 by bringing cases under the False Claims Act, with about $12\u00a0billion of that involving fraud against federal health-care programs. In the largest settlement, British drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline agreed last year to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay $3\u00a0billion in fines for improperly marketing numerous drugs and not reporting safety data about a diabetes medication. Federal law forbids companies from marketing drugs for uses other than those specifically approved by the FDA, although doctors may prescribe drugs for such off-label uses. \u201cWhen pharmaceutical companies interfere with FDA\u2019s mission of ensuring that drugs are safe and effective for the American public, they undermine the doctor-patient relationship and put the health and safety of patients at risk,\u201d John Roth, director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations, said Monday in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement demonstrates the government\u2019s continued focus on pharmaceutical companies that put profits ahead of the public health.\u201d In addition to the monetary penalties, Johnson & Johnson entered a five-year agreement with the government, requiring the company to change its executive compensation program so it can recoup money from employees who engage in misconduct. The agreement requires the company to submit detailed reports to federal officials about its business operations and any payments to physicians. Associate Attorney General Tony West said such nonmonetary provisions are an effort \u201cto change corporate behavior\u201d rather than to merely impose fines. \u201cIn addition to accountability,\u201d West said, \u201cwe are looking for deterrents.\u201d Johnson & Johnson said it had cooperated with government investigators during years of inquiries about the various allegations. The company said one of its subsidiaries will plead guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for the way it promoted Risperdal. But despite the hefty settlement, Johnson & Johnson said it \u201cexpressly denies the government\u2019s civil allegations.\u201d The company also said that it had previously accrued the settlement amounts, and that no other charge to earnings would be recorded. \u201cToday we reached closure on complex legal matters spanning almost a decade,\u201d Johnson & Johnson general counsel Michael Ullmann said in a statement. \u201cThis resolution allows us to move forward and continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions that improve and enhance the health and well-being of patients around the world.\u201d Monday\u2019s settlement also will result in a significant payout for whistleblowers in three states \u2014 Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and California \u2014 who officials said will receive nearly $168\u00a0million of the government\u2019s take. \n Sari Horwitz contributed to this report.", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Brady Dennis", "wordCount": 723}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Wonkblog: Here\u2019s why Central Appalachia\u2019s coal industry is dying", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334bed50/sc/30/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cezra0Eklein0Cpost0Cheres0Ewhy0Ecentral0Eappalachias0Ecoal0Eindustry0Eis0Edying0C20A130C110C0A40C9fa80A8580E459b0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Brad Plumer", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Wonkblog: Meet Preet Bharara, who just won the biggest insider trading case ever", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334b9f6d/sc/30/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cezra0Eklein0Cpost0Cmeet0Epreet0Ebharara0Ewho0Ejust0Ewon0Ethe0Ebiggest0Einsider0Etrading0Ecase0Eever0C20A130C110C0A40Ce42352d40E45970E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Lydia DePillis", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Wonkblog: The memo that could have saved Obamacare", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334b981b/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cezra0Eklein0Cpost0Cthe0Ememo0Ethat0Ecould0Ehave0Esaved0Eobamacare0C20A130C110C0A40C3520A710A60E4590A0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Ezra Klein", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "The Switch: How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334b0a95/sc/21/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cthe0Eswitch0Cpost0Chow0Ewe0Eknow0Ethe0Ensa0Ehad0Eaccess0Eto0Einternal0Egoogle0Eand0Eyahoo0Ecloud0Edata0C20A130C110C0A40C699d79f0A0E458c0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "The Switch: Yes, there actually is a huge difference between government and corporate surveillance", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636543/s/334b05c0/sc/22/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cthe0Eswitch0Cpost0Cyes0Ethere0Eactually0Eis0Ea0Ehuge0Edifference0Ebetween0Egovernment0Eand0Ecorporate0Esurveillance0C20A130C110C0A40Ca52d9a6c0E45880E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ibusiness/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["business"], "author": "Brian Fung", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "The Switch: Valve\u2019s Steam Machine is the anti-console.

Responding to questions from the House Ways and Means committee, Tavenner said the site would be functional \u201cat the end of November.\u201d \n \n Obamacare creating a larger part-time workforce? \n \n\n Critics of the health care law have warned that companies will pull back on part-time workers\u2019 hours in response to a rule requiring them to cover anyone who works more than 30 hours a week. \n New government data suggests employers are not yet taking that tack with their current employees (the percentage of employees who work between 26 and 29 hours per week has barely budged this week), however, the share of new jobs that are part-time has surged from around 10 percent to more than 60 percent. \n \n More firms planing to add health coverage \n \n Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of small business owners report that their health insurance premiums have risen this year, according to the first installment in a new three-year study by the Washington-based National Federation of Independent Business. Nevertheless, the number of small firms planning to add health coverage next year exceeds the number planning to drop their plans, the survey showed. \n \n SBA le nding holds steady \n \n The Small Business Administration supported around $30 billion in loans to small companies for the third consecutive year in fiscal 2013, the agency said last week, even as small-business lending nationwide has tapered off. While the agency\u2019s total amount of loan guarantees decreased slightly from $30.25 billion last year to $29.6 billion in 2013, the total number of loans edged up from 53,848 to 54,106. \n \n \n \n \n Small firms bracing for slow holiday season \n \n Many small-business owners worry the recent government shutdown could put a damper on the upcoming shopping season, according to newsurveys by Manta, an online small-business directory. A September poll showed that 13 percent of small companeis were expecting a slower holiday season this year, however, a second reading taken days after the shutdown ended showed that number had jumped to 40 percent. \n \n Small business employment slips \n \n It was another tough month on Main Street, according to the latest readings by payroll services provider Intuit, which showed that the number of small-business workers, their compensation and their hours all dropped in October. It marks the fourth consecutive month of employment declines and the 27th straight month in which the average number of hours worked by employees of small firms has slipped. \n \n \n What are you keeping an eye on this week?

Now he is on the cusp of becoming the next mayor of this bankrupt and beleaguered city . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Duggan, 55, holds a commanding lead in the polls over Wayne County Sheriff and former Detroit police chief Benny Napoleon, 58, going into Tuesday\u2019s election, putting him on course to become Detroit\u2019s first white mayor in four decades. It is an unlikely story for an 83\u00a0percent black city that stood at the forefront of African American political power when Coleman Young became its first black mayor in 1974. Before Young, the Motor City had two black congressmen: Charles Diggs Jr. and John Conyers Jr., Democrats who helped found the Congressional Black Caucus. That political leadership, coupled with good-paying auto industry jobs and the city\u2019s standing as the original home of Motown Records, made Detroit a hub of black influence. But before long, the jobs began to dis appear, and \n middle-class flight accelerated. Those problems were intensified in recent years by a flagrant corruption scandal involving former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick (D), who is serving a 28-year prison sentence , and the \n bankruptcy filing \n in July, which altered the city\u2019s politics. \n\n \u201cI am noticing that a lot of people are not talking about voting for somebody who looks like them but somebody who thinks like them,\u201d said Darrell Reed, 40, pastor of Spirit of Love Missionary Baptist Church, where Duggan greeted volunteers gathering for a patrol aimed at minimizing the annual spree of Halloween arsons, a long tradition here. Duggan said long-suffering voters seem less interested in his race than in his standing as a self-proclaimed turnaround expert with years of experience reviving troubled area institutions. \u201cA major part of why I have so much support is that everyone in the city understands that if you\u2019re broke, you can\u2019t deliver any services,\u201d Duggan said in an interview. \u201cSo, I think there is a strong feeling in the city that we need a mayor who can balance the budget and operate the city well financially.\u201d Although Duggan moved into Detroit\u2019s stately Palmer Woods neighborhood just last year, he was born and raised in the city and has worked here for the past 32 years. He also is familiar with its tough politics, having worked for Wayne County, which includes Detroit. His campaign has attracted strong financial backing from the city\u2019s business community, allowing him to outspend Napoleon by about 4 to 1. The outpouring for Duggan seems to have left his opponent a little stunned. Napoleon has emphasized his history as a lifelong Detroit resident and a police chief who oversaw a large reduction in crime, and as someone who will stand up to the city\u2019s emergency manager. He also argues that Detroit\u2019s problems are overstated, something he says has helped Duggan. \u201cWhen you convince people that they are desperate and their desperation is caused by somebody who looks like them, it starts people to thinking that \u2018maybe we do need to do something different,\u2019\u2009\u201d Napoleon said. \u201cAnd that is the refrain that is going out.\u201d  \n Seeking a \u2018life preserver\u2019 \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Duggan, a former Wayne County prosecutor, is credited with steering Detroit Medical Center, the city\u2019s biggest employer, to profitability. The hospital was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy after losing a half-billion dollars in the five years before Duggan took over in 2004. In 2010, it was sold to Vanguard Health Systems, a private hospital company that has pumped more than $1.5\u00a0billion into its operation. In the 1990s, as an aide to then-Wayne County Executive Ed McNamara, Duggan took the helm of the financially troubled regional bus system, eliminating a large budget deficit and improving service. Before that, he was integral to the creation of a plan to lift the county out of a long era of severe budget deficits. \u201cHow is it that Duggan, a white guy who moved into the city from Livonia, is doing so well? It seems to defy logic,\u201d said Bill Ballenger, founder of Inside Michigan Politics. \u201cBut there is a feeling of total disgust among voters about what has happened to Detroit, and there is a willingness to reach out to the most prominent life preserver. And that is Mike Duggan, based on his reputation as a Mr. Fix-It. And Detroit is desperate for a Mr. Fix-It.\u201d Still, Duggan\u2019s past challenges are nothing like what he will confront if he is elected mayor. Vast tracts of the sprawling city have been reduced to urban prairie as abandoned properties have been demolished. Tens of thousands of buildings sit vacant and unsecured, inviting squatters and drug dealers. Some 40 percent of the streetlights do not work. Violent crime remains a severe problem, and police and ambulance response times are among the worst of any big city in the country, at times stretching to nearly an hour. The population has shriveled by more than 26 percent in the past 13 years. And an estimated 42 percent of the remaining 701,000 residents \u2014 and three out of five of the city\u2019s children \u2014 live in poverty, according to census statistics and the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Topping things off, the city is an estimated $18\u00a0billion in debt. Its financial future is being hashed out in court, where a federal judge is in the middle of a hearing to determine Detroit\u2019s eligibility for bankruptcy protection. Many observers consider approval of the city\u2019s bankruptcy petition a foregone conclusion. A restructuring deal could involve the sale of valuable assets, including parts of the world-class collection at the Detroit Institute of Arts . It also is likely to mean that city employees and 23,000 retirees would lose parts of their promised pensions and retiree health-care benefits. \n A recovery plan \n Meanwhile, the city\u2019s finances and daily operations are under the control of Kevyn Orr , a former D.C. bankruptcy lawyer whom Gov. Rick Snyder (R) appointed emergency manager in March. His term runs at least until September, when a super\u00admajority of the City Council could vote him out. Duggan, who like Napoleon is a Democrat, says that if he is elected, his first order of business will be to seek a meeting with Snyder and Orr. He says that his experience as a hospital executive taught him how Detroit could cut its debt substantially by changing how retiree health benefits are delivered and that worker pensions \u2014 as well as city assets, such as its art collection \u2014 should be held sacrosanct. He also has laid out a plan to let the city more quickly seize abandoned housing and to create incentives for homeowners to move away from lightly populated blocks, allowing the land to be converted into urban gardens and recreation areas. He also is critical of Orr\u2019s running of Detroit, saying most residents tell him that services have not improved since his appointment. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has focused on the operations of the city,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cI think he has focused on the complexities of the bankruptcy.\u201d Outgoing Mayor Dave Bing (D) has complained that Orr has not consulted him on key appointments and decisions, something Duggan says he would not tolerate.

After a look at his plans, the bank\u2019s executives decided that Lovell was a good candidate for the SBA\u2019s 504 loan program, through which the agency provides partial financing (paired with capital from the bank) for real estate purchases or construction. Lovell soon secured a $6.2\u00a0million loan through John Marshall, more than $2\u00a0million of which came courtesy of the SBA. \u201cIt\u2019s a very valuable program that both the banking community and the small-business economy rely on to help grow the economy,\u201d said Bill Ridenour, president of the bank. \u201cWe have done a lot of these loans, and I know they are becoming popular with a lot of our competitors, too.\u201d From October 2012 through the end of last month, the SBA signed off on $29.6\u00a0billion in small- business loans, down slightly from $30.25\u00a0billion the year before and an all-time peak of $30.5 billion in 2011. Still, the total number of loans edged up from 53,848 last year to 54,106 in 2013. The SBA\u2019s 2013 totals include more than 5,000 loans for $745\u00a0million under the agency\u2019s relatively new Small Loan Advantage program, which is intended to get more small-dollar loans to firms in underserved communities, and 682 loans for $500\u00a0million under its CAPLines initiative, which helps entrepreneurs access short-term working capital. \u201cUnder President Obama, SBA lending has reached record levels and we continue to get more capital into the hands of small business owners than ever before,\u201d Acting SBA Administrator Jeanne Hulit said in a statement. The structure of the 504 program is somewhat unique, in that a portion of the loan comes directly from the SBA\u2019s network of community-based, nonprofit lending partners, known as Certified Development Companies. Conversely, most SBA loans are made by banks, credit unions and other private lenders with a partial guarantee from the federal government. The idea is to encourage bankers to take on more small-business loans by allowing the government to shoulder some of the risk of default. However, the programs, which once paid for themselves, no longer come cheap. Leading up to the recession, every year from 2005 to 2009, the loan fees collected by the agency outpaced the amount the department was forced to pay for oversight and default payments. In 2010 and 2011, the tides started to turn, and the agency was provided $80 million each year to cover losses in the lending programs, according to a report compiled by the Congressional Budget Office. In 2012, it ticked up to $207.1 million, and this year the agency was allotted $316 million for the loan programs, because about 4.5 percent of SBA loan recipients defaulted. Still, the agency has maintained a steady flow of loans over the past three years even as private small-business lending has tapered off . In June 2012, for instance, banks had $588 billion in outstanding loans to small firms, down 3.1 percent from the end of 2011. Meanwhile, some studies have shown that a lending decline for small companies has been ongoing for more than a decade. Michael Flynn, chief operating officer for Rockville, Md.-based Eagle Bank, said demand for small-business loans took a steep dive during and immediately following the recession but has started to rebound. However, banks often rely on sales and other financial figures from the past few years to evaluate the health of a company, so for firms seeking loans, those down years can make it difficult for them to win approval. And that, Flynn said, is why loan guarantees can make a difference. \u201cIf we have a loan application that\u2019s on the edge, if you can get the SBA guarantee, then that becomes a transaction we can do,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWithout that guarantee, some of our loans would probably never have been approved, and that\u2019s the real advantage of the SBA programs.\u201d Flynn said the programs have grown in popularity during the past two years, because the agency lowered the fees it charges on various types of loans, including its signature 7(a) loan-guarantee program, which provides general-purpose working capital to small businesses. \u201cNow when you compare the costs of an SBA loan to other sources of financing for a small business, it has become relatively attractive,\u201d Flynn said. \n\n Follow J.D.

But he called Syria \u201c the largest calamity that has befallen the world in the present millennium.\u201d If that is not \u201ca reason to intervene, to stop the bloodshed, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d Saud said.

Kerry also met here with Saudi King Abdullah II. Kerry said before the visit that he wanted to \u201cmake sure that the Saudi Arabian-U.S. relationship is on track,\u201d despite deep differences over high-profile policy issues in the region, including Syria, Iran and Egypt. \u201cThe Saudis are very, very important to all of these things,\u201d Kerry said during a stop at the U.S. Embassy. \u201cThe Saudis are sort of the senior player, if you will, in the Arab world. .\u2009.\u2009. The Saudis have an ability to be able to influence a lot of the things that we also care about and we work together on.\u201d Kerry\u2019s visit to this desert kingdom was hastily appended to a scheduled North Africa trip, after the Saudis became increasingly public in their disapproval of the Obama administration\u2019s cautious stance toward Syria\u2019s civil war, its negotiations with Iran, and its failure to fully support the Egyptian military that in the summer overthrew an elected civilian government. Both Kerry and Saud emphasized that their countries share overall policy goals in the region, including peace and stability in Syria, a nuclear-weapons-free Middle East and progress toward democracy in Egypt. But the Saudis and other Persian Gulf governments say they do not believe U.S. policies will achieve those shared objectives. They have said they are prepared to branch out on their own without U.S. leadership or coordination. At Abdullah\u2019s Royal Palace, Kerry sat to the right of the 89-year-old king. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to Washington and a close aide to Abdullah, sat between and behind the king and Kerry. Officials in the Gulf said they did not expect their differences with the United States would be resolved during Kerry\u2019s trip, which also includes a stop in the United Arab Emirates. Regional leaders have long urged greater U.S. involvement in Syria \u2014 where wealthy governments and individuals are funding and arming rebel forces \u2014 and were taken aback by President Obama\u2019s abrupt decision to cancel a planned military strike against Syria following a chemical weapons attack orchestrated by Assad. Along with Israel, the Arab nations are also concerned that the United States will strike a nuclear deal not to their liking with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main regional rival and Israel\u2019s principal outside threat. The gulf governments also were opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated leadership that was voted into power in Egypt last year in democratic elections that won some praise from the United States. The Saudis and their neighbors have objected even to the relatively mild criticism levied by Washington at the military coup that overthrew that Islamist government, and at its criticism of the new military government\u2019s crackdown against political opponents. But gulf officials have also emphasized their many shared interests with the United States on energy, counterterrorism and other matters. They said Kerry\u2019s personal diplomacy, while not substantially changing views, is likely to smooth frayed relations. From Saudi Arabia, Kerry will travel Monday evening to Poland. He will then return to the Middle East, stopping in the UAE, Jordan, Israel and the West Bank.

The Saudi man had been killed in fighting, and his corpse, with its beatific smile, was photographed and displayed in a Twitter posting inviting others to celebrate his martyrdom. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cHe always used to say: \u2018Those martyrs smile. What is it they see?\u2019\u00a0\u201d a former comrade wrote in a tribute to the fighter, identified as Abu Hamad al-Saya\u2019ri. In another post, an admirer mused about the good fortune of the fallen and speculated on what the dead must be saying: \u201cCongrats to me, congrats to me, I became a martyr.\u201d The Saudi fighter is one of hundreds of Islamist veterans of the Syrian conflict whose deaths are heralded in Web postings, many of which feature bloody \u2014 and, occasionally, smiling \u2014 portraits of the newly deceased . Although the images may strike many Westerners as macabre, they have become one of the rites of service among Syrian jihadists, as well as a popular recruiting tool. \u201cThese guys are celebrated, and to young people back in the neighborhoods, they are heroes,\u201d said Steven Stalinsky , executive director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washington nonprofit group that monitors Web sites and news media in the region. \u201cThey look at the photos and they say, \u2018I can be this guy.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The memorials for dead fighters are but one manifestation of an explosion in the use of social media by Islamists since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. Although jihadists have long used the Internet to communicate messages from leaders or spread images of battle, Syrian rebel groups are flocking to Web sites such as Twitter, Instagram and Flickr to create new ways to recruit, train, raise money, debate theology and coordinate strategy, researchers say. To some Syrian rebels and their supporters, Twitter is not just a communications tool but also an online cash machine, useful for soliciting donations or even running auctions for donated cars and jewelry. Others use Skype accounts to conduct interviews with potential recruits or to share advice on military tactics. Still others employ YouTube or Facebook to trumpet their battlefield successes or to document alleged atrocities by their opponents. The sites\u2019 growing popularity among the more extremist Syrian rebel groups \u2014 including some with ties to al-Qaeda \u2014 has prompted calls for more stringent policing by the U.S. companies that own them. A handful of accounts have been blocked, but the vast majority continue to operate, providing a rare window into the thinking, planning and tactics of jihadist groups in Syria and beyond, analysts say. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting in the age of Twitter is that the normal jihadi cultural material \u2014 previously confined to private discussion forums \u2014 is being broadcast more widely where everyone can see it,\u201d said William McCants, a Brookings Institution scholar who studies the Islamists\u2019 use of the Internet. \u201cThe closed jihadi community is coming out into the light of day and inviting others to join.\u201d  \n Tributes, testimonials \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Among the most striking features of the Syrian conflict is the profusion of social-media postings devoted to individual fighters, both living and dead. Since the arrival of the first foreign jihadists in Syria more than two years ago, rebel volunteers have used Facebook and Twitter accounts to keep their friends and relatives updated about their experiences, just as U.S. troops stationed in war zones do. When fighters are killed, the same Web sites offer a way to spread the news to family and friends and pay tribute to the fallen, researchers say. With flowery language and photographs that sometimes border on ghoulish, the online tributes seek to reinforce the Islamist belief in martyrdom as a high calling \u2014 a noble death that guarantees a place in paradise. Last year, Stalinsky\u2019s group began to catalogue the \u201cmartyrdom\u201d tributes showing up on Facebook and Twitter. But a year later, Stalinsky said, there were so many postings that the organization could not keep up. Many of the postings include images and allusions intended to resonate with the Muslim faithful. In some photos, bodies with grievous wounds are posed so that they appear to be smiling or, in some cases, pointing to heaven. Dead rebels with wide, toothy grins elicit admiring comments, as was the case when the image of a lightly bearded youth was displayed on a Twitter account in April. \u201cWe have seen many martyrs smiling when they meet with their God, but we haven\u2019t seen a smile this wide,\u201d responded a man writing under the Twitter name FahadJabbar1. \u201cWhat did he see to make this beautiful smile? Oh Allah, grant us martyrdom.\u201d A common belief among jihadists is that martyrdom brings special rewards in paradise, including the affections of 72 \u201chouris\u201d \u2014 black-eyed virgins promised to men in the afterlife \u2014 as well as an ability to win entry to heaven for the martyr\u2019s relatives. Jihadist teaching also holds that the martyr\u2019s corpse resists decay and exudes a perfume-like smell. Thus, many of the photos of the dead are accompanied by testimonials claiming that the bodies possessed an otherworldly aura. \n\n \n \u201cThe scent of musk emanated from his pure body, and it was smelled by the mujahideen,\u201d Twitter member Albaraibnmalik1 said of a dead fighter whose smiling, bearded face was featured in an online posting in March. \u201cWomen trilled loudly after they smelled the musk emanating from his body.\u201d \n Propaganda mechanism \n Until recently, when a terrorist leader such as Osama bin Laden sought to convey a message , he would send videotapes via couriers to trusted assistants who would post them on Islamic Web sites \u2014 a process involving delays of several days or even weeks. By contrast, rebel commanders in Syria have instant access to thousands of followers. Groups in Kuwait that support the Syrian rebels have used Twitter to run increasingly elaborate fundraising drives , including online auctions that accept cash bids for donated luxury goods, including Land Rover SUVs, diamond necklaces and resort properties. Others use social networking sites to distribute not only resources but also ideas. Some of Syria\u2019s larger rebel groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra, an Islamist faction linked to al-Qaeda, use Twitter and Facebook in much the same way that corporations and government agencies in the United States do. The groups run sophisticated media outreach programs that allow them to better manage their public image, said Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group , a private company that monitors jihadists\u2019 Web postings. Jabhat al-Nusra, which has been labeled a terrorist organization by the Obama administration, has sought to counter that image with an aggressive social-media campaign that seeks to cast the group in a softer light, Katz said. Some recent postings on YouTube showed Jabhat al-Nusra fighters handing out food and blankets or clearing trash from rubble-strewn Syrian neighborhoods. \u201cClearly this new style of media propaganda is very different from the old fighting images affiliated with the jihadist outlets,\u201d Katz said. Such efforts reflect an ambition to \u201cwin hearts and minds of the local population as well as the international community,\u201d she said. Such messaging depends on services and networks run by U.S. firms. Twitter, a San \u00adFrancisco-based company, is the preferred platform for many of the groups in Syria. It is also regularly used by top al-Qaeda terrorists, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, the group\u2019s leader since the death of bin Laden. Twitter in recent months has taken steps to shut down a number of accounts linked to known terrorists, but company officials have said that they lack the resources to monitor the estimated 500 million registered users and 340 million messages posted on a typical day. Although attempts to police the sites are laudable, Katz said, \u201cin most cases, they fail to make a significant dent.\u201d", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Joby Warrick", "wordCount": 1270}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "WorldViews: Germany is only now exposing many Stasi spies.

I refuse to be tried by this court.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Morsi and his co-defendants, who like him are loyal to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, then began chanting to disrupt the proceedings. Presiding Judge Ahmed Sabry Youssef responded by adjourning the trial for two months. It is scheduled to resume on Jan. 8. Morsi, Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president, has been charged with murder and incitement to violence. He has been held virtually incommunicado since he was deposed in a July 3 military coup, and he was brought to the trial in a military helicopter. After the trial was postponed, state television reported that Morsi was being transferred to a prison in the coastal city of Alexandria. It was unclear why. Cameras and recording devices were prohibited inside the courtroom. That meant that the proceedings unfolded out of sight from the nation that chose Morsi as its leader in 2012. Silent video footage released later showed Morsi wearing a suit with no tie as he entered the cage-like docket to the applause of his co-defendants. His co-defendants, dressed in white, stood with their backs to the judges, their hands held high in a four-fingered salute that has become a symbol of solidarity for those opposed to the military coup. The salute recalls a raid on the Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp in August in which hundreds were killed; the word \u201cRabaa\u201d means four in Arabic, and so activists use the four-fingered salute to recall the massacre. The symbol has become ubiquitous on signs and pins at protests, and as an avatar on social media. In the footage, lawyers and Egyptian journalists appeared to be shouting from the audience. Witnesses said two journalists called loudly for Morsi\u2019s execution, reflecting the strong anti-Brotherhood stance adopted by both state-run and private media in Egypt since the coup. Morsi was originally supposed to be tried at Cairo\u2019s notorious Tora Prison. But officials said Sunday that the proceedings were being moved to the police academy, a compound ringed by high walls and concertina wire. Morsi\u2019s supporters said the shift, away from a cluster of neighborhoods where Morsi still commands wide popularity, made it more difficult for protesters to demonstrate in force. Because Morsi \u201cdoes not accept the terms of the trial,\u201d he has refused to accept legal representation, said Nasser Soliman, one of a group of several dozen defense attorneys who are loyal to the former president. Still, dozens of lawyers came to the police academy and demanded access to Morsi and his co-defendants,and the evidence against them. The lawyers said they applied for permits to attend the trial, but mostly had been denied. \u201cThere is not a single attorney for Mohamed Morsi,\u201d one lawyer yelled at police officers through the barbed wire barrier, his face red and distorted in fury. \u201cGo check with your commanders. We are the defense committee.\u201d   But the protest outside the military academy was small. Participants said the turnout reflected the mounting challenges facing an anti-coup movement, which has been decapitated by large-scale arrests, close monitoring and a campaign of intimidation by security forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cIt has gotten much more difficult because anyone who wants to oppose the current regime gets taken [by security] immediately,\u201d said Soad Mohamed, a university student who stood amongst the protesters as they chanted, \u201cDown with military rule.\u201d Since the coup, Egypt\u2019s government has killed more than a thousand Morsi supporters , and imprisoned thousands more, including some of the Brotherhood\u2019s longtime lawyers. Rights groups say it is the fiercest security crackdown on a political group in Egypt in decades. The charges against Morsi relate to several days of clashes between Brotherhood supporters and their opponents during protests against a new constitution, which unfolded outside the presidential palace in December, 2012. London-based watchdog Amnesty International said Sunday that the conditions of Morsi\u2019s secret detention \u201camount to forced disappearance\u201d and lend significant doubt to the prospect of due process. \u201cMohamed Morsi was denied access to his lawyers while he was being interrogated and investigated. This significantly undermines his right to a fair trial,\u201d Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International\u2019s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. Egypt\u2019s justice system has long been marred by politics, corruption and general dysfunction. Courtrooms are often the scene of chaotic, theatrical shouting matches, and it is common for trials to be adjourned repeatedly due to lack of evidence, the absence of lawyers, witnesses, or defendants, or complaints from various parties. Hosni Mubarak, the longtime autocrat whose 2011 ouster set the stage for Morsi\u2019s ascension, is currently in the middle of a lengthy retrial, after an initial prosecution on charges of corruption and killing protesters was aborted for lack of evidence. It is the first time in Egyptian history that two former presidents are on trial concurrently. Rights activists and lawyers say there is a stark contrast between the military-backed government\u2019s swift prosecution of Morsi and his supporters and the slow pace of justice for Mubarak and members of his regime, who are accused of running a corrupt and abusive police state for three decades. Mubarak was released from prison on August 22, after an appeal against his detention was granted. At least three other Mubarak-era politicians who were charged in the wake of the 2011 uprising have also been freed pending trial or seen the charges against them dropped in the months since Morsi was removed. \n\n Ahmed Ezz , the steel monopolist and former head of Mubarak\u2019s ruling party, and one of the chief popular villains of the 2011 uprising, was cleared of corruption charges in August. In early October, a court unfroze the assets of Hussein Salem, a longtime Mubarak business associate who had also been charged with corruption. \n Sharaf al-Hourani in Cairo contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Abigail Hauslohner and Erin Cunningham", "wordCount": 986}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "WorldViews: Would the world blame Israel if Iranian nuclear talks fail?", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/334a8cc5/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cblogpost0Cpost0Cwould0Ethe0Eworld0Eblame0Eisrael0Eif0Eiranian0Enuclear0Etalks0Efail0C20A130C110C0A40C312a61740E457c0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Max Fisher", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "WorldViews: Wow: Nearly half of Egyptians support suspending TV satirist Bassem Youssef", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/33497176/sc/40/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cblogpost0Cpost0Cwow0Enearly0Ehalf0Eof0Eegyptians0Esupport0Esuspending0Etv0Esatirist0Ebassem0Eyoussef0C20A130C110C0A40Cbc6d3fe20E4570A0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Max Fisher", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Musharraf granted bail in Red Mosque murder case, should end house arrest", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/3348176c/sc/11/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cmusharraf0Egranted0Ebail0Ein0Ered0Emosque0Emurder0Ecase0Eshould0Eend0Ehouse0Earrest0C20A130C110C0A40C6685e37c0E454d0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Former military ruler Pervez Musharraf was granted bail Monday in a criminal case involving his alleged role in the killing of a radical Islamic cleric during a 2007 siege at a mosque. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The court decision brings Musharraf a step closer to being able to move freely about Pakistan, after six months of house arrest. Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup and stepped down in 2008, must post two bonds roughly equivalent to $1,000 each. His attorneys said he plans to do so on Tuesday. The former ruler has been under house arrest since April after being charged in a string of cases related to his dictatorship, including alleged involvement in the murder of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, the killing of Baloch separatist leader Akbar Bugti and detention of Pakistani judges. Over the summer, bail was granted on all those charges. The court hearing on Monday involved a murder charge against Musharraf for his oversight of an eight-day siege at the Red Mosque in 2007, when the military sought to dislodge hard-line Islamic students barricaded inside. The students had been terrorizing Islamabad, targeting alleged brothels, music stores and massage parlors as part of an anti-vulgarity campaign, the government said. About 100 people were killed in the siege, including cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi. Prosecutors say Musharraf recklessly deployed security forces, but his lawyers argue that his role in the matter was limited. \u201cMy client is a free man now, as he has been granted bail in the last case against him,\u201d Ilyas Siddiqi, Musharraf\u2019s lawyer, told reporters. \u201cMusharraf was granted bail because no proof of his involvement in the killing of Abdul Rashid Ghazi could be found.\u201d While under house arrest, Musharraf has been detained at his home on the outskirts of Islamabad. Even with bail, his travels will probably remain limited. Under the orders from the Pakistani government, he\u2019s not able to leave the country. Musharraf is also facing death threats, including from Taliban militants. Musharraf returned to Islamabad in March after years of self-imposed exile. He has vowed to remain in Pakistan, and perhaps to reenter politics. \u201cHe will face all the cases, as he has been doing until now,\u201d said Afshan Adil, a member of Musharraf\u2019s legal team. \n Tim Craig contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Shaiq Hussain", "wordCount": 378}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "As U.S. withdraws from Afghanistan, poppy trade it spent billions fighting still flourishes", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/33424685/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cnational0Esecurity0Cas0Eus0Ewithdraws0Efrom0Eafghanistan0Epoppy0Etrade0Eit0Espent0Ebillions0Efighting0Estill0Eflourishes0C20A130C110C0A30C55cc99d60E43130E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "The United States is withdrawing troops from Afghanistan having lost its battle against the country\u2019s narcotics industry, marking one of the starkest failures of the 2009 strategy the Obama administration pursued in an effort to turn around the war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Despite a U.S. investment of nearly $7\u00a0billion since 2002 to combat it, the country\u2019s opium market is booming, propelled by steady demand and an insurgency that has assumed an increasingly hands-on role in the trade, according to law enforcement officials and counternarcotics experts. As the war economy contracts, opium poppies, which are processed into heroin, are poised to play an ever larger role in the country\u2019s economy and politics, undercutting two key U.S. goals: fighting corruption and weakening the link between the insurgency and the drug trade. The Afghan army opted this spring for the first time in several years not to provide security to eradication teams in key regions, forgoing a dangerous mission that has long embittered rural Afghans who depend on the crop for their livelihoods. Experts say that, in the end, efforts over the past decade to rein in cultivation were stymied by entrenched insecurity in much of the country, poverty, and the ambivalence \u2014 and, at times, collusion \u2014 of the country\u2019s ruling class. With a presidential election just months away, political will for anti-drug initiatives is weak among members of the Afghan elite, many of whom have become increasingly dependent on the proceeds of drugs as foreign funding dries up, said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, who heads the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Afghanistan. \u201cMoney is less and less available within the licit economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real danger is the weakened resistance to corruption and to involvement in a distorted political economy, which weakens your resistance to collusion with the enemy.\u201d As U.S. forces have withdrawn from Afghanistan \u2014 roughly 51,000 American troops are left, down from a peak of 100,000 \u2014 insurgents have fought particularly hard to reclaim lost ground in Helmand province, the center of Afghanistan\u2019s poppy industry, U.S. military officials have said. In its latest progress report on Afghanistan to Congress , the Pentagon warned that the 2013 poppy harvest was expected to be \u201cconsiderably\u201d bigger than 2012\u2019s, citing warmer early-season weather, the drawdown of NATO troops and the high price for poppies. The July report characterized the reach of counternarcotics efforts by the Afghan government and its foreign partners as \u201csmall but not insignificant.\u201d The report noted that demand remains high, drug-smuggling networks remain resilient, and \u201cinsurgent penetration of that market is extensive and expanding.\u201d \nThe UNODC is scheduled to release its yearly Afghan opium survey report next week. Experts and Western diplomats in Kabul have said they expect the report to show a dramatic expansion of cultivation from 2012, when the agency estimated that 154,000 hectares of land were used to harvest poppy. U.S. officials say they have established a competent, well-trained Afghan counternarcotics police agency and a special drug court to discourage the trade. But the long-term sustainability of those efforts is uncertain as the West reassesses spending levels in Afghanistan after 2014, when the U.S. combat mission is due to end, and continues to shift increasing responsibility for security to the Afghans.   American officials say they have established a competent, well-trained Afghan counternarcotics police agency and a special drug court to discourage the trade. But the long-term sustainability of those efforts is uncertain as the West reassesses spending levels in Afghanistan after 2014 \u2014 when the U.S. combat mission is due to end \u2014 and continues to shift increasing responsibility for security to the Afghans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Haroon Rashid Sherzad, Afghanistan\u2019s deputy counternarcotics minister, said getting at the root causes of Afghanistan\u2019s drug problem would take a generation and vastly expanded regional cooperation. \u201cThe concern I have is whether the international community realizes the importance of this problem for global instability and security,\u201d he said in an interview, singling out regional neighbors, in particular. \u201cThey should understand that the drug economy is fueling terrorism, destabilizing the region and the global village. It is vanishing the achievements of the past 10 years.\u201d Soon after Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 election, as his administration weighed a Pentagon request to deploy tens of thousands of additional troops to the worsening conflict, the White House set out to overhaul its approach to counternarcotics. Until then, the United States and its allies in Afghanistan had turned a blind eye to the drug links of several warlords they backed. \n\n Richard Holbrooke , who would become President Obama\u2019s top envoy for the region, argued that the United States needed a robust interagency approach to fight the drug trade. It would include aggressive interdiction, strengthening rule-of-law institutions and taking down the heads of the trade \u2014 even if that meant pursuing senior government officials. The Drug Enforcement Administration, which had just more than a dozen agents in Afghanistan, deployed several dozen more to the war zone, embedding small teams in U.S. military bases. DEA officials said they became alarmed by how intertwined the trade and the insurgency had become. Taliban leaders had long taxed poppy farmers, but more insurgents were running drug labs and smuggling networks, investigators found. \u201cAt first, they saw it as a means to achieve their ends, as a funding source,\u201d a senior DEA official in Kabul said in an interview. \u201cAs so often happens with drugs, it corrupted them. You get money and power and influence and all those things through drug trafficking, not to mention houses and fancy cars.\u201d The booming trade had a peculiar feature that stunned agents who had tackled cartels in Colombia and Southeast Asia. Unlike drug networks in those regions, where rivalry among kingpins often turned violent, Afghan drug traffickers were surprisingly collaborative. \u201cThey seem to operate more as a collective,\u201d said the DEA official, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity to provide a candid assessment of the problem. \u201cThey\u2019ll share land. They\u2019ll share labs, chemists. It was surprising to those of us who came from areas where that was a problem.\u201d The DEA and members of Afghanistan\u2019s counternarcotics police had considerable success in interdiction operations and brought a steady stream of cases to a drug tribunal funded by the U.S. and British governments. But few top kingpins were prosecuted. Extraditing cartel chiefs to the United States was not an option, because Kabul and Washington do not have an extradition treaty.   The State Department funded manual eradication initiatives that were run by provincial officials. It also established a monetary rewards system for governors of provinces that remained poppy-free or had significant declines in cultivation. The U.S. Agency for International Development, meanwhile, launched programs to increase the appeal of alternative crops. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Critics of the West\u2019s counternarcotics policies say that while some of those initiatives were well thought out, ultimately they were too little, too late. The office of the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction noted in its latest quarterly report that drug interdictions have dropped as the U.S. drawdown has gained steam. The DEA operations, the report added, will be largely constrained to Kabul; without the military, agents will have limited ability to move around the country safely. Drug trafficking is all but guaranteed to flourish unimpeded in Kandahar and Helmand, the southern provinces where the largest share of U.S. troops were killed during the war, the auditing agency warned. \u201cPoor security, a small Afghan [counternarcotics] security force, minimal assets and lack of intelligence to identify opium production networks are likely to allow drug traffickers to move and operate largely unimpeded in these important provinces,\u201d the inspector general warned in the September report. Hajji Sha Wali, an elder in Helmand province, said poppy farmers were once open to heeding the calls from Kabul and international officials suggesting they plant alternative crops. \u201cThey told us they would give us alternatives, build bridges for us, but they didn\u2019t keep their promises,\u201d Wali said in a phone interview from his home district, Marja. Most ordinary Afghans dislike the drug trade, he added, but a growing number are turning to it out of necessity or coercion. \u201cBut people are very impoverished, and costs are rising every day. Meanwhile, the armed opposition forces are getting people to plant poppy so they can make money from it.\u201d The senior DEA agent said the fight against drugs will probably become more challenging in the years ahead. \u201cThis is going to be the Afghans\u2019 fight to carry forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to be here in some numbers to support and assist them and continue to advise, but it definitely has to be turned over to them.\u201d Lemahieu, the U.N. official, said the counternarcotics institutions the West is leaving behind represent a model of the type of effort that could ultimately make a dent. But they lack political support and remain woefully small, he said. \u201cIf you leave 2,700 counternarcotics police to clean up Afghanistan of drug activity, good luck,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Ernesto Londo\u00f1o", "wordCount": 1466}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Kerry in Cairo: Egypt aid suspension \u2018not a punishment\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/333f685c/sc/40/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cmiddle0Ieast0Ckerry0Ein0Ecairo0Eegypt0Eaid0Esuspension0Enot0Ea0Epunishment0C20A130C110C0A30Cf5b142420E44910E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "CAIRO \u2014 Secretary of State John F. Kerry said here Sunday that the suspension of some U.S. assistance to Egypt \u201cis not a punishment\u201d and that aid was \u201ca very small issue between us\u201d compared with the many interests the two countries share. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Kerry, who made an unannounced stop in Cairo at the beginning of an 11-day trip through the Middle East and North Africa, is the most senior U.S. official to visit since the Egyptian military ousted elected President Mohamed Morsi in the summer. Morsi is scheduled to go on trial Monday. In public comments surrounding meetings with Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi and the leaders of an interim military-appointed civilian government, Kerry sought to balance the long-term U.S. commitment to Egypt with what he described as temporary concerns about human and civil rights and the promised return to full civilian rule under an elected government. \u201cOur hope is that we can make the progress\u201d needed to restore all elements \n of a $1.3 billion annual military assistance program, \u201cand then we will march together hand in hand into the future with Egypt playing the vital role it has played traditionally\u201d in the Arab world, Kerry said at a news conference with interim Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy. Fahmy, who last month described U.S.-Egyptian relations as being in a \u201cturbulent\u201d state, was equally effusive in his praise for strong bilateral ties. But he emphasized that Egypt would act \u201cbased on our own priorities.\u201d The July 3 overthrow of Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood-led government put the administration in the uncomfortable position of disapproving the undemocratic action but reluctant to undermine ties with a key Arab partner. U.S. relations with Morsi had been stormy, and the administration has pushed for a quick military retreat back to the barracks and a return to full civilian rule. Egypt\u2019s military and interim government have made progress on implementing a road map in that direction. But in the months since the coup, Egyptian security forces have led the harshest crackdown on political opponents in decades \n, throwing thousands behind bars and shooting hundreds of anti-coup protesters in the streets. More recently, the state has begun to go after secular politicians and activists who had backed the coup but have grown critical. A senior State Department official traveling with Kerry said the issue of Morsi\u2019s trial on murder charges was not raised in his talks with Sissi or Adly Mansour, the interim president. But Kerry pressed both to be more \u201cinclusive\u201d of those who disagree with them and said \u201cthere should be an outreach\u201d to members of the Muslim Brotherhood and others not involved in violence, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door talks. Kerry also urged them not to extend a military-declared state of emergency due to expire Nov.\u00a014\u00a0and stick to plans for a new constitution \u2014 due in draft form by Dec. 3 \u2014 and early parliamentary and presidential elections. Sissi, the official said, asked the United States for \u201cpatience\u201d while the government navigates the current upheaval.   Administration arguments will be enhanced if Kerry can persuade military leaders here to temper some of the more extreme crackdowns and implement economic reforms that Morsi resisted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Kerry has been seeking more progress on civilian rights, including \u201cfreedom of assembly, freedom of the press, the human rights issues, the participation of civil society in government,\u201d and assurances that Egypt is \u201cheading for a credible, transparent political transition with reform of the constitution\u2026parliamentary elections, presidential elections,\u201d said a senior State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door diplomatic talks. In addition to meeting government and military leaders, Kerry sat down with representatives from a cross-section of faith-based, human rights, you and labor groups to discuss political and economic reform. \u201cIt is no secret that this has been a difficult time and these have been a turbulent couple of years,\u201d Kerry said at the news conference. Egyptian upheaval began in early 2011 with the U.S.-backed removal of long-time president Hosni Mubarak after weeks of massive popular protests. But, Kerry said, \u201cWe are committed to work with, and we will continue our cooperation with the interim government.\u201d \u201cThe U.S.-Egyptian relationship should not be defined by assistance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are much bigger issues that matter to us, that concern us, that define the relationship.\u201d At least one-third of the Arab world\u2019s population lives in Egypt, Kerry noted, and Egypt continues as a U.S. partner on counterterrorism issues, security in the Sinai and along Egypt\u2019s border with the Gaza Strip, and administration efforts to promote peace between the Arabs and Israel. Powerful Persian Gulf countries welcomed the ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood. The amount of aid withheld by the United States pales beside $12 billion that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have contributed to Egypt since the coup. Officials from those countries have also more generally criticized U.S. policy in the region, including the administration\u2019s reluctance to become directly involved in Syria\u2019s civil war and the attempted rapprochement with Iran. Kerry took strong exception Sunday to reports of that criticism, which he said were \u201cwithout any foundation whatever to the fact of what is actually happening in relations\u201d between the United States and regional partners. \u201cWe can have a difference on a policy [or] on the tactics of a policy. For instance, some countries in the region that wanted the United States to do one thing with respect to Syria, and we have done something else,\u201d Kerry said. But \u201cwe all share the same goal\u2026the salvation of the state of Syria and the transition government put in place\u2026that can give the people of Syria the opportunity to choose their future.\u201d \u201cLet me be crystal clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States of America is deeply engaged in the peace process\u201d that Kerry is shepherding between the Israelis and Palestinians and is \u201cdeeply involved in supporting the defensive capacity of many countries in the region,\u201d he said, mentioning Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and others and adding that \u201cwe will not allow those countries to be attacked from the outside, we will stand with them.\u201d The United States, Kerry said, is also \u201cthe principal interlocutor with respect to\u2026.sanctions toward Iran\u201d and \u201cguarantees that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.\u201d He cited the United States\u2019 leading role in providing humanitarian aid to war-displaced Syrian civilians, and in working with Russia toward a Syrian peace conference and on the successful dismantlement of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Karen DeYoung", "wordCount": 1061}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Rebels lose ground to Assad forces in Syria war; Free Syrian Army official Akaidi resigns", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/33413b81/sc/20/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Crebels0Elose0Eground0Eto0Eassad0Eforces0Ein0Esyria0Ewar0Efree0Esyrian0Earmy0Eofficial0Eakaidi0Eresigns0C20A130C110C0A30Ce3ecbf440E44bb0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "KILIS, Turkey \u2014 Forces loyal to Syria\u2019s government are taking advantage of deepening rifts among the country\u2019s rebels to advance into rebel-held territory in northern Syria, overturning some long-held assumptions about the war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The resignation Sunday of a top leader in the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army further underscored the extent to which rebel infighting is undermining the effort not only to topple President Bashar al-Assad but also to hold on to territories won by the opposition in more than two years of conflict. Col. Abdul Jabbar Akaidi, one of the chief recipients of the limited U.S. aid provided to the opposition, said he was standing down to protest the rebel bickering, which he blamed for the capture Friday by Assad loyalists of the strategic town of Safira , southeast of the key city of Aleppo. The fall of Safira restored a vital supply link between Damascus and government forces holding out in the divided northern city and put regime loyalists on track to challenge other opposition strongholds in Aleppo province, almost all of which has been under rebel control for more than a year. Opposition commanders said Safira fell after Islamist brigades failed to respond to a call for reinforcements by the Taw\u00adheed Brigade, Aleppo\u2019s biggest rebel battalion, which was forced to flee under a withering bombardment by the Syrian air force. \n Peace talks at stake \n The government\u2019s advances in the north call into question some of the received wisdom about the state of play on the Syrian battlefield, a constantly shifting procession of skirmishes, sieges, offensives and counteroffensives that for many months has amounted to a stalemate. While the government has reinforced its hold over the central provinces of Homs and Damascus in recent months, the rebels have been consolidating their grip in the north, a divide that is expected to underpin peace talks that the United States and Russia are hoping to sponsor in Geneva this month. The battle of Safira is unlikely to signal a decisive shift in the pattern. The government\u2019s supply lines are long and vulnerable to rebel ambush. But it does suggest that the rebels are more vulnerable than had been thought in the vast swaths of northern territory that they captured last year, analysts say. If the rebels are unable even to hold ground in the north, the calculus of the Geneva peace conference also will shift, said an opposition figure who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive. The opposition will be less inclined to attend if it is losing, he said, and \u201cAssad will have no reason to compromise at all.\u201d Panic spread across rebel-held Aleppo over the weekend as residents who thought the government had been expelled for good contemplated the prospect that their neighborhoods could be contested again. \u201cPeople are so scared,\u201d said Zakaria Ahmed, 39, an Aleppo businessman who traveled Sunday to the Turkish border town of Kilis after a night of intense shelling by government forces triggered fears of an imminent offensive. \u201cIt seems the Free Syrian Army is incapable of defending even themselves, let alone the people.\u201d  \n \u2018Lack of unity\u2019 \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The capture of Safira fit a pattern in recent months in which the government has managed to reverse rebel gains with the help of an influx of thousands of Shiite fighters from Iran, Iraq and the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, reinforced by steady supplies of weapons from Russia and Iran. The rebels complain that they receive barely a fraction of such support from their Western and Persian Gulf backers, known as the \u201cFriends of Syria.\u201d  But rebel defeats in the north can be attributed as much to disarray within the ranks of the opposition as to the fighting capacities of the government, analysts say. \u201cIt\u2019s a consequence of their lack of unity of command and purpose. The regime is united and purposeful,\u201d said Jeff White, defense analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Clashes have been erupting with increasing frequency between mainstream units of the Free Syrian Army and fighters with the al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq, which has expanded rapidly across the rebel-held north in recent months. Units loyal to Gen. Salim Idriss , the U.S.-backed leader of the Free Syrian Army\u2019s Supreme Military Council, \u201chave been fighting a two-front war, which has seriously hampered their efforts against the regime,\u201d the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week. \n At the same time, powerful Islamist battalions that do not adhere to al-Qaeda\u2019s ideology but fall outside the structures of the Supreme Military Council have been forming new alliances dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state, rather than a democracy. They have received the lion\u2019s share of funding from wealthy Persian Gulf countries and are positioning themselves to receive more in the wake of pledges by Saudi Arabia to counter American inaction in Syria by increasing aid to the rebels. At a gathering of top commanders at a remote hotel outside the southern Turkish city of Reyhanli last week, the moderate Free Syrian Army representatives rebuffed an attempt by the Islamists to join the military council, accusing them of seeking to shoulder aside the mainstream units, with their inferior resources. But commanders at the meeting also acknowledged that they are increasingly outgunned and outmanned by the Islamist brigades. Akaidi, among those whose influence has waned as the Islamists have expanded, criticized the stream of meetings that are being held to thrash out the differences. \u201cYou warlords .\u2009.\u2009. stop chasing positions and stature, and only caring about being famous,\u201d he said in a video posted on YouTube. \u201cReturn to the battlefield, and leave behind your egos.\u201d", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Liz Sly", "wordCount": 933}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "India to launch Mars mission as international space race grows more competitive", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/334095dd/sc/39/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Casia0Ipacific0Cindia0Elaunches0Emars0Emission0Eas0Einternational0Espace0Erace0Egrows0Emore0Ecompetitive0C20A130C110C0A30C34f4b7960E44b90E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s space agency has begun its formal countdown for the launch of its unmanned orbiter to Mars \u2014 a voyage that India hopes will help contribute to the growing body of scientific data on the far-off planet. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t On Tuesday afternoon, if all goes as planned, India will launch the spacecraft \u2014 called Mangalyaan, or Mars Orbiter Mission probe \u2014 from a small island near Chennai on the country\u2019s southern coast. The craft will take 11 months to reach the atmosphere of the cold, forbidding planet, traveling 140 million miles from Earth. India\u2019s prime minister, Manmohan Singh, announced plans for the mission during a major address in August 2012, a few months after rival China\u2019s attempt to send an orbiter on a Russian mission failed, raising talk of a new space race in Asia. But Deviprasad Karnik, a spokesman for India\u2019s space agency, said the primary objective of the trip is to \u201cshowcase technological capability to reach Mars\u201d and collect data for future space missions. India\u2019s space program, which is a half-century old, has long been a source of national pride , especially in recent years as the rapidly modernizing country raised its ambitions beyond satellite technology to lunar and other planetary travel. An unmanned probe that India sent to the moon in 2008 contained an instrument \u2014 financed by the United States \u2014 that detected water trapped in lunar rocks. But as India enters the ranks of nations that have successfully sent spacecraft to Mars, the program has not been without its critics, who wonder why the country is spending $74\u00a0million on interplanetary travel while millions of its people remain poor and malnourished. \u201cIt\u2019s a national milestone for the country to conquer territories beyond planet Earth,\u201d said Bharath Gopalaswamy, a Chennai native who is the deputy director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council. \u201cIndia has its own ambitions. Just because we\u2019re poor doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t have any ambitions. That\u2019s not the way we think about ourselves, right?\u201d The program\u2019s defenders have said that it helped develop satellite technology for India that was used for the benefit of the underserved, bringing classrooms and health care to remote areas and mapping water resources for wells. \n\n India is entering the Mars arena as the international space race has grown far more competitive and globalized and a growing number of countries and commercial entities have set their sights on sending a manned mission to Mars sometime in the next two decades. NASA head Charles Bolden has said that a human mission to Mars \u2014 that the U.S. space agency hopes to launch by 2030 \u2014 is a priority for the agency and that the \u201centire exploration program is aligned to support this goal.\u201d Close on the heels of the India launch, NASA will launch its newest Mars probe , called MAVEN, from Cape Canaveral on Nov. 18, which scientists hope will lend insights into climate changes that can help them understand climate shifts on Earth. Meanwhile, the United States has been losing its historical dominance in the arena as funding has slumped and other nations have jumped into the fray. Scientists say that the India mission will help continue to map the surface of Mars, which in many ways remains a mystery. \u201cDespite the existing data, we really do not understand the planet\u2019s history and its potential for life,\u201d Jeff Plescia, a scientist with the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an e-mail. Plescia said previous spacecraft have seen small channels forming, dusty material moving around the planet\u2019s surface, craters from asteroids forming, and ice being exposed and evaporating. \u201cHaving more sensors in orbit provides a better understanding of those events and how they occur,\u201d he said. If all goes as scheduled, the Mangalyaan spacecraft is expected to reach Mars\u2019s orbit by September, making India the fourth nation or group to reach Mars, after the United States, Russia (and the former Soviet Union), Japan and the European Space Agency. But NASA\u2019s director of planetary science, Jim Green, said the Indian mission faces long odds. Of 40 missions to Mars by various countries, he says, only 16 have been successful. \u201cThe track record tells us Mars is very, very hard,\u201d Green said. He noted that some missions have missed the planet entirely and that some have crashed into it. India\u2019s orbiter \u2014 should it make it all the way there \u2014 will carry a sensor that could help detect the presence of methane, a gas produced by living microbes. If found, the presence of methane could answer the question that has dogged scientists for years: Is there life on Mars? Although NASA scientists think they found methane in earlier experiments, the Mars rover, Curiosity, which landed on the cratered surface last year, has not found any. But they have not given up hope. \u201cWe are seeking signs of life, and methane can be one of those signatures,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to know if Mars is currently harboring life that\u2019s generating methane now, so the India mission is a great step.\u201d \n Suhasini Raj contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Annie Gowen", "wordCount": 838}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In Tehran, \u2018death to America\u2019 still rings 34 years later", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/333e9ece/sc/20/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cmiddle0Ieast0Cin0Etehran0Edeath0Eto0Eamerica0Estill0Erings0E340Eyears0Elater0C20A130C110C0A20C414fe2620E423f0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "TEHRAN \u2014 Despite recent indications of a thaw in relations between Washington and Tehran, Iran is going ahead with a 34-year-old November ritual: anti-U.S. demonstrations to commemorate the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t With each passing year, the annual protests have diminished in their impact. But the anniversary still symbolizes tensions and mistrust at the center of the U.S.-Iran relationship, and hardline conservatives are calling for \u201cdeath to America\u201d chants to occupy center stage at the Nov. 4 event. Now under the control of the hardline Student Basij Organization, the old embassy grounds remain known here as the \u201cDen of Espionage,\u2019\u2019 and anti-American propaganda still fills the walls both inside and outside the compound. The property, which is bordered by an imposing brick wall that hundreds of students scaled that day in 1979, seizing the embassy and its occupants, is a vast piece of prime real estate in what was then the commercial center of the city. Only rarely is the compound open to the public, but the doors have been flung open in the week leading up to the anniversary, and foreign visitors \u2014 including a few Americans \u2014 joined in a tour. \u201cWhy not?\u2019\u2019 a guide, Mohammad Reza Shoghi joked when the Americans asked if they could see a bit more of the grounds. \u201cIt belongs to you.\u2019\u2019 Against the backdrop of recent warm words between the American and Iranian president, what is on display inside the compound can seem relics of a different era: an American flag painted on the driveway, cracked down the middle; a replica of the Statue of Liberty whose midsection is made up of prison bars trapping a pair of doves; the crest of the United States, mangled by a chisel but still recognizable; and countless posters recounting alleged American atrocities around the world. The street that ran alongside the embassy was named Roosevelt under the shah. Now it is called Mofatteh after a revolutionary cleric and university professor. \n\n\nThe lone building now open to visitors was once the former consular section, the top floor of which, say its current occupiers, housed a secret CIA unit dedicated to spying on Iranians. Past a series of doors and corridors are rooms filled with communication equipment \u2014 high-tech at that time \u2014 along with documents, many of them pieced back together from shreds. Revolutionary loyalists have long contended that the contents of this building provide ample evidence of U.S. spying activities during the 1970s. Shoghi, the guide, works for the organization that oversees the property, and he is adept in spelling out Iran\u2019s official version of events. He explains that the American hostages were treated well during their 444 days of captivity, even though, he says, all 52 of those who were held were working as spies. One of the former hostages, John Limbert, served briefly under President Obama as the country\u2019s first deputy assistant secretary of state for Iranian affairs. He has called for more open communication between Washington and Tehran as a step toward renewing ties between the two countries. But he also continues to say that what he and the 51 other hostages endured cannot be justified.   Now a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, Limbert said in an e-mail exchange that the hostage takers are guilty of \u201cviolating a trust and ignoring responsibility for safety of guests in their midst. No amount of rationalization can change that reality.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n \u2018Never regretted what we did\u2019 \n A number of former hostage-takers were contacted for this report, but none agreed to answer questions related to those events. In the past, they have argued that their actions were necessary under the circumstances. Masoumeh Ebtekar, the fluent English speaking spokeswoman of the hostage-takers, said in a panel discussion earlier this year that she and others who took over the embassy \u201cnever regretted what we did and our action must be assessed based on the situation of that period. \u201cI think the decision was the best thing we could do to protect the revolution,\u2019\u2019 Ebtekar said at the event, organized to promote discussion of \u201cArgo\u201d the Academy Award winning film that told the story of a CIA mission that allowed several U.S. foreign service workers, hidden by Canadian diplomats, to escape Tehran. Ebtekar, who was just a teenager at the time, went on to become the highest ranking female official in the Islamic republic\u2019s history, and she later wrote a book, in English, on the hostage crisis called \u201cTakeover in Tehran.\u201d Her attitude about the events, according to another chronicler of the hostage crisis, is shared by many of her cohorts. \u201cWhile some certainly regretted the reverberations their action set off, they dismissed the judgment of international law in favor of demanding justice in their immediate situation,\u201d said David Harris, whose 2004 book \u201cThe Crisis: The President, the Prophet and the Shah,\u201d is based on interviews with most of the principals on both sides of the ordeal. \n Chance for rapprochement \n This year, the run-up to the Nov. 4 demonstrations has included some public debate in Iran about whether it is time to put an end to the \u201cDeath to America\u2019\u2019 chants. But hard-liners who are uncomfortable with the recent warming of relations have called instead for the slogan to receive special emphasis. Limbert and other former hostages say such rhetoric cannot be permitted to stand in the way of rapprochement. \u201cFor those of us on the political side, we were originally in Tehran because we believed then, in 1979, that the U.S. and the new revolutionary Iran needed to talk,\u201d Limbert said in the interview. He wrote in a recent article for the Middle East Institute that he still feels the same way, three and a half decades later. He predicted that when relations eventually normalize, U.S. and Iranian officials will wonder: \u201cWhat was all the fuss about, and why did we waste 34 years quarreling?\u201d", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Jason Rezaian", "wordCount": 965}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In midst of Syrian war, giant Jesus statue is raised", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/333b5058/sc/20/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cin0Emidst0Eof0Esyrian0Ewar0Egiant0Ejesus0Estatue0Earises0C20A130C110C0A20C96b9df9e0E43ef0E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "BEIRUT \u2014 In the midst of a conflict rife with sectarianism, a giant bronze statue of Jesus has gone up on a Syrian mountain, apparently under cover of a truce among three factions in the country\u2019s civil war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Jesus stands, arms outstretched, on the Cherubim mountain, overlooking a route pilgrims took from Constantinople to Jerusalem in ancient times. The statue is 40 feet tall and stands on a base that brings its height to 105 feet, organizers of the project estimate. That the statue made it to Syria and went up without incident Oct. 14 is remarkable. The project took eight years and was set back by the civil war that followed the March 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Christians and other minorities are all targets in the conflict, and the statue \u2019s safety is by no means guaranteed. It stands among villages where some fighters have little sympathy for Christians. So why put up a giant statue of Christ in the midst of such setbacks and so much danger? Because \u201cJesus would have done it,\u201d organizer Samir al-Ghadban quoted a Christian church leader as telling him. The backers\u2019 success in overcoming the obstacles shows the complexity of civil war, where sometimes, despite the atrocities, the warring parties can reach short-term truces. Ghadban said that the main armed groups in the area \u2014 Syrian government forces, rebels and the local militias of Sednaya, the Christian town near the project site \u2014 halted their fire while organizers set up the statue. Rebels and government forces occasionally agree to cease-fires to allow the movement of goods, but they typically do not admit to them. It took three days to raise the statue. Photos provided by organizers show it being hauled in two pieces by farm tractors, then lifted into place by a crane. Smaller statues of Adam and Eve stand nearby. The project, called \u201cI Have Come to Save the World,\u201d is run by the London-based St. Paul and St. George Foundation, which Ghadban directs. Ghadban said most of the financing came from private donors, but did not give further details. Russians have been a driving force behind the project \u2014 not surprising given that the Kremlin is Assad\u2019s chief ally and that the Orthodox churches in Russia and Syria have close ties. Ghadban, who spoke from Moscow, is Syrian Russian and lives in both countries. Ghadban said he began the project in 2005, hoping the statue would be an inspiration for Syria\u2019s Christians. He said he was inspired by Rio de Janeiro\u2019s towering Christ the Redeemer statue. \u201cIt was a miracle,\u201d Ghadban said. \u201cNobody who participated in this expected this to succeed.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Associated Press\n\n \n \n AP writers Raphael Satter in London and Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Diaa Hadid", "wordCount": 446}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Egypt considers expanded powers for military in new constitution", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/333b4e8c/sc/20/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cmiddle0Ieast0Cegypt0Econsiders0Eexpanded0Epowers0Efor0Emilitary0Ein0Enew0Econstitution0C20A130C110C0A20Ccf0Ab3c8e0E41a70E11e30E8b740Ed89d714ca4dd0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "CAIRO \u2014 The committee writing Egypt\u2019s constitution is enmeshed in a contentious debate over provisions that would grant the military special privileges, including the power to try civilians in secret military courts amid a widespread crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The head of the 50-member committee, former foreign minister and Arab League chief Amr Moussa, has held a series of closed-door meetings with top military officials, who are pushing to persuade delegates to include such a clause. The army says it needs the ability to prosecute civilians who harm its interests as militant attacks increase. A final draft of the constitution is expected to be finished by Dec.\u00a03. But the provisions would further entrench and expand the military\u2019s already considerable authority. With its troops on the streets and a military-appointed government in power \u2014 after a July coup that ousted President Mohamed Morsi, who is set to go on trial Monday \u2014 the army is the country\u2019s dominant political actor. \u201cThis is not a moment where there is any likelihood of limiting the military\u2019s privileges\u201d in the constitution, said Heba Morayef, Egypt director for the New York-based Human Rights Watch. \u201cThey see the civilian justice system as an infringement. And one of the privileges the military has clung to very consistently is the broad discretion to punish and try people as they choose. They really care about maintaining that.\u201d Now, the army can indict anyone for any crime in which an officer is involved, sending defendants to secret trials that lack the basic tenets of due process. Military judges regularly mete out harsh punishments that cannot be appealed and bar detainees from access to legal counsel. The 2012 constitution, drafted under the Brotherhood-backed Morsi, also gave the military wide discretion to indict civilians for vaguely defined \u201ccrimes that harm the armed forces.\u201d And in the period following the 2011 uprising against former strongman Hosni Mubarak \u2014 which many protesters thought would usher in a new era of democratic rule \u2014 the country\u2019s interim military council put some 12,000 civilians on trial in special army courts. But rights advocates had hoped they could use Morsi\u2019s ouster, facilitated by mammoth grass-roots protests, to overturn or at least restrict the military\u2019s power to prosecute. \u201cWe wanted the committee to support a complete ban on the use of military trials for civilians, even in cases where one of the parties is a military officer,\u201d said Mona Seif, co-founder of the No Military Trials advocacy group, established in 2011. But Seif said the pro-army political climate and recent violence \u2014 in which at least 1,000 people have died and militants stage regular bomb attacks \u2014 have created broad support for the military\u2019s requests for harsh security measures. Seif was called on to brief the committee but said she was later sidelined in the panel\u2019s closed-door discussions with the military. Seif and Morayef said the generals are insisting on an article with similar wording to the 2012 constitution that would give the military wide-ranging authority .   \u201cThe army knows that having this in the constitution makes their use of military trials much more legitimate,\u201d Seif said. \u201cNow we know they will never give it up. It\u2019s their most powerful tool.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The military has stepped up its use of special tribunals to quickly prosecute Morsi supporters and opponents of the government it installed following the July coup. At least 300 people are facing military trials in Ismailia province, according to Seif, whose group tracks civilians in military detention. An army court sentenced 60 others, mostly in the city of Suez, to 5 to 25 years in prison for offenses such as violating the army\u2019s nightly curfew. The committee\u2019s spokesman, Mohamed Salmany, said its members are working to draft a provision that would safeguard the military from terrorist attacks while addressing the concerns of rights groups.\n \u201cThe people want military trials, they do not want chaos,\u201d said 43-year-old Sayed, a street vendor in downtown Cairo who said he was afraid to give his full name. \u201cNot only should these people go on trial, they should also be hanged in public squares. The only thing that works for us is military rule.\u201d But rights groups warn that such broad power will have unintended consequences. On Wednesday, a Cairo military court sentenced a journalist with the el-Watan newspaper to a year in prison for \u201cimpersonating an army officer,\u201d the publication said on its Web site. It was unclear under what circumstances the reporter, Hatem Aboul-Nour, had been arrested. Because troops are stationed across the country, policing volatile areas and manning checkpoints on major highways, the army can arrest citizens easily, Morayef said. \u201cThey\u2019re in the streets, they are the law enforcement,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if a military officer thinks you have insulted him at a checkpoint, you can be brought to a tribunal. If you are arrested by a military officer, you can be brought to a tribunal.\u201d And sometimes, rights activists say, nobody even knows you\u2019re there. \u201cThis will have very serious consequences for all civilians, and not just political activists,\u201d said Karim Medhat Ennarah, security sector researcher at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people \u2014 ordinary people \u2014 who get caught up at a military checkpoint and are never heard from again.\u201d \n Sharaf al-Hourani contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Erin Cunningham", "wordCount": 863}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Syrian conflict: Persian Gulf officials, tired of waiting for U.S., move to boost aid to rebels", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/333c325d/sc/20/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cnational0Esecurity0Csyrian0Econflict0Epersian0Egulf0Eofficials0Etired0Eof0Ewaiting0Efor0Eus0Emove0Eto0Eboost0Eaid0Eto0Erebels0C20A130C110C0A20Caf0Ac85540E43240E11e30E8b740Ed89d714ca4dd0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "Persian Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, are moving to strengthen their military support for Syrian rebels and develop policy options independent from the United States in the wake of what they see as a failure of U.S. leadership following President Obama\u2019s decision not to launch airstrikes against Syria, according to senior gulf officials. Although the Saudis and others in the region have been supplying weapons to the rebels since the fighting in Syria began more than two years ago and have cooperated with a slow-starting CIA operation to train and arm the opposition, officials said they have largely given up on the United States as the leader and coordinator of their efforts. Instead, the Saudis plan to expand training facilities they operate in Jordan and increase the firepower of arms sent to rebel groups that are fighting extremist elements among them even as they battle the Syrian government, according to gulf officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve comity with the United States. What officials described as a parallel operation independent of U.S. efforts is being discussed by the Saudis with other countries in the region, according to officials from several governments that have been involved in the talks. Unhappiness over Syria is only one element of what officials said are varying degrees of disenchantment in the region with much of the administration\u2019s Middle East policy, including its nuclear negotiations with Iran and criticism of Egypt\u2019s new government. Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrives in Saudi Arabia on Sunday on a hastily arranged visit \u2014 to include his first-ever meeting with King Abdullah on Monday \u2014 that is designed to smooth increasingly frayed U.S. relations with the kingdom. Kerry will also stop in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Israel, all of which have expressed concerned at what they see as a weakened U.S. posture in the region. The 11-day trip also includes visits to the West Bank, Poland, Algeria and Morocco. Egyptian state media reported Friday that Kerry will begin his trip with a brief stop Sunday in Egypt, his first visit there since the military ousted President Mohamed Morsi this summer. The State Department declined to confirm the visit. Officials in several countries that had pledged to support a U.S. strike on Syrian targets after confirmation that President Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons described their stunned reaction to Obama\u2019s abrupt decision in late August to cancel the operation just days before its planned launch so he could ask for congressional agreement. \u201cWe agreed to everything that we were asked . . . as part of what was going to take place,\u201d said a senior Saudi official reached by telephone in the kingdom. Instead of the 10-to-12-hour warning before launch that the Americans had promised, the official said that Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan \u201cdid not know about [the cancellation]. . . . We found out about it from CNN.\u201d Although the current policy differences are unlikely to be resolved soon, if at all, the Saudis derive part of their standing as a regional leader from their close ties to Washington. Kerry\u2019s visit, in large part, is designed to publicly stroke that aspect of the Saudi image.   Gulf officials emphasized that the U.S.-Saudi relationship, spanning eight decades since the kingdom\u2019s founding, is based on a range of issues, including energy, counterterrorism, military ties, trade and investment, that remain important to both. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Any major attempt at outside intervention in Syria on behalf of the opposition would be limited without the participation of U.S. equipment, personnel, and command and control. Although France, for example, shares some of the Saudi concerns and the French defense minister met with King Abdullah and discussed major new defense contracts in Riyadh early this month, the United States\u2019 partners in Europe have long expressed reluctance to intervene in Syria without a mandate from the United Nations or NATO. In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s support for the U.S. strike option being prepared this summer was abandoned when Parliament voted against any participation. Turkey, a NATO partner that has long protested what it sees as Obama\u2019s tepid Syria policy, has branched off on its own in terms of support for the rebels. Although the administration has long described Iranian support for Assad as crucial to the Syrian president\u2019s survival, foreign ministers from Turkey and Iran met in Ankara last week to voice their shared concerns about the increasingly sectarian nature of the war. Sunni Saudi Arabia has no interest in reaching out to Shiite Iran, which it sees as its primary rival for influence in the region. The Saudis are convinced that the United States is so eager to make a deal with Iran that it has already signed on to an arrangement that its allies in the region \u2014 including Israel \u2014 are sure to disapprove of. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the senior Saudi official said. Saudi distress over the Obama administration\u2019s engagement with the new leadership in Iran may be even more fundamental to the current strain in relations than differences over Syria and also Egypt. The Saudis, who see Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood as a threat, believe the administration is hypocritical in its concern that the military rulers who overthrew Morsi are using too heavy a hand in cracking down on Morsi\u2019s Brotherhood organization. The United States, said one gulf official, expressed little concern over similar abuses under Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whom the United States supported before he was overthrown in early 2011. With new U.S. arms shipments to Egypt suspended, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait have given the new Egyptian government $12\u00a0billion to defray expenses, and officials said they plan to contribute at least another $3\u00a0billion in the coming days. While the United States and its gulf allies share the same objectives in the region \u2014 a stable Egypt, a non-nuclear Iran and a peaceful Syria without Assad \u2014 one official said those allies have concluded that none of those objectives will be reached with Obama\u2019s current policy. Israel, which shares their concerns, has been relatively reticent in expressing its worries in public, as have the UAE, Jordan and others. But the Saudis have been unusually public in voicing their dissatisfaction. In a speech in Washington this month, former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal described Obama\u2019s Syria policies as \u201clamentable.\u201d Last month, the Saudis canceled their annual speech at the U.N. General Assembly and later turned down their first election to a Security Council seat in what they made clear was a protest against inaction in Syria and outreach to Iran. \u201cWhen you commit to something and then you don\u2019t deliver on it, that\u2019s when you have a problem,\u201d the Saudi official said. \u201cIt is an accumulation of these type of cases, incidents, and on and on.\u201d", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Karen DeYoung and Bob Woodward", "wordCount": 1111}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Pakistani officials rebuke U.S. for drone strike", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/333b43f2/sc/3/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Casia0Ipacific0Cpakistani0Eofficials0Erebuke0Eus0Efor0Edrone0Estrike0C20A130C110C0A20Ce740A99b40E43f20E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The U.S. drone strike that killed the head of the Pakistani Taliban drew expressions of outrage from political officials here Saturday, capped by a public rebuke of the Obama administration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t A day after three missiles were fired into a vehicle in northwestern Pakistan, senior Taliban members confirmed Saturday that Hakimullah Mehsud and four others had been killed in the attack, a major victory in the decade-old U.S. campaign targeting Islamist militants. But after they had buried their former chief, Pakistani Taliban leaders began to regroup, vowing retaliatory strikes against U.S. interests. With security heightened across Pakistan, the sharpest effect so far has been the derailment, at least temporarily, of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s efforts to engage Mehsud and other Taliban leaders in peace talks . In an angry, hour-long, televised press conference Saturday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan accused the United States of \u201cambushing\u201d the Sharif government\u2019s efforts by authorizing the strike. \u201cThe government of Pakistan does not see the drone attack as an attack on an individual, but as an attack on the peace process,\u201d he said. After Khan spoke, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry lodged a formal protest with U.S. Ambassador Richard G. Olson, saying the attack had violated Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty. The Foreign Ministry also plans to protest to the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. When Sharif returns here after spending the weekend in London, he and his national security team will reexamine \u201cthe entire perspective\u201d of future relations with the United States, including NATO\u2019s use of Pakistani highways to transport equipment to and from Afghanistan, Khan said. U.S. officials had no immediate comment Saturday, although a White House official noted Friday that Mehsud was linked to a 2010 plot to bomb Times Square in New York. Mehsud, who Taliban leaders said was buried early Saturday in North Waziristan, was also implicated in a 2009 attack on a CIA outpost in eastern Afghanistan that killed seven Americans. The United States posted a $5 million bounty for him, as well as for another senior Pakistani Taliban leader, Wali ur-Rehman, who was killed in a drone strike in May. Several analysts said those killings represent a major setback for the militant group, which comprises dozens of factions and is loosely affiliated with al-Qaeda as well as with the Afghan Taliban. But Pakistani Taliban leaders met Saturday to try to select a new leader and shake off suggestions that Mehsud\u2019s death will have a lasting impact on the group. Some Taliban officials said that Khan Said, the group\u2019s second-in-command, has emerged as a front-runner to succeed Mehsud. But two Taliban members who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the group has decided to appoint Sheheryar Mehsud, a little-known 33-year-old militant who has fought in both Kashmir and Afghanistan, as its temporary leader. Other officials said that a final decision could come as early as Sunday.   Saifullah Mehsud of the Islamabad-based FATA Research Center, which investigates terrorism organizations, said that whoever is chosen is likely to be less rigid than Hakimullah Mehsud, who was controversial even among Taliban sympathizers for authorizing attacks on civilians. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cThe first reaction [from the Pakistani Taliban] is going to be one of retaliation, and they will want revenge, and they may call off the peace talks, but in the long run, having a figure like him not being around is going to make it easier for all parties involved,\u201d Saifullah Mehsud said.  Several Pakistani cities, including the capital, Islamabad, were on high alert Saturday, and an Interior Ministry official said additional precautions were being taken around diplomatic compounds. \u201cEvery drop of Hakimullah\u2019s blood will turn into a suicide bomber,\u201d Azam Tariq, a local Taliban spokesman, told reporters in South Waziristan. But Khan, the interior minister, blamed the United States for Pakistan\u2019s security problems, saying that the drone campaign is fueling instability in the country. He said Sharif had asked Obama during a White House meeting last month for assurances that the United States would not interfere in the planned talks with the Taliban. \u201cIs this how you support the dialogue?\u201d Khan said. \u201cOne day before discussions are supposed to start, you take out the leader who was supposed to talk?\u201d Also expressing outrage, the chief political leader of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said Saturday that he will immediately press for a blockade of NATO supply routes through Pakistan. \u201cWe will not allow it. Even if our government falls, then let it be so,\u201d said Imran Khan, the leader of the Movement for Justice party, which heads the local government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a main route for NATO convoys to and from Afghanistan. But Zahid Hussain, a military analyst based in Islamabad, said that much of Pakistan\u2019s military and political establishment is privately \u201cquite happy\u201d that the country\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 most-wanted man\u201d is dead. Neither the military nor the powerful intelligence service commented on Hakimullah Mehsud\u2019s death Saturday. \u201cThey knew the peace talks were never going to go anywhere,\u201d Hussain said. \n Haq Nawaz Khan, Shaiq Hussain and Saleem Mehsud contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Tim Craig", "wordCount": 834}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Drone kills Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud; Pakistan accuses U.S. of derailing peace talks", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/33332e5f/sc/11/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Casia0Ipacific0Cpakistani0Eofficial0Eaccuses0Eus0Eof0Esabotage0Eas0Edrone0Etargets0Etaliban0Eleaders0Ein0Enorthwest0C20A130C110C0A10C1463d0Ac20E431d0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s interior minister on Friday accused the United States of attempting to \u201csabotage\u201defforts to hold peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban after a suspected U.S. drone strike targeted senior leaders of the militant group, including the group's leader. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The strike, the second in northwestern Pakistan this week, occurred Friday evening in North Waziristan. According to local intelligence officials, several Taliban commanders, including leader Hakimullah Mehsud, were meeting at a house there to discuss how to proceed with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s effort to hold peace talks.  Local officials said Mehsud was killed in the strike, although Pakistani leaders said they could not verify those reports. Mehsud took over as head of the Pakistani Taliban in 2009 after the group\u2019s previous leader, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Hakimullah Mehsud has also been reported killed on several occasions, only to quickly resurface. The United States has a $5\u00a0million bounty on Hakimullah Mehsud for his alleged role in a 2009 attack on a CIA outpost in eastern Afghanistan that killed seven Americans. In May, a U.S. drone killed Wali ur-Rehman, then the second-ranking member of the militant group. He also had a U.S. bounty on him for his alleged role in the CIA outpost attack. Local intelligence officials said six people were killed in Friday\u2019s attack, including Hakimullah Mehsud\u2019s bodyguard and driver. They said that the other four bodies are unrecognizable but that they suspect Mehsud is among the dead. \u201cHis vehicle and close aides\u2019 killings are the indications that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in the attack,\u201d one of the officials said. If his death is confirmed, the strike could severely undermine Sharif\u2019s plan for talks to try to end years of internal strife that has claimed the lives of more than 45,000 Pakistanis. On Thursday, while on an official visit to London, Sharif announced that the long-awaited talks were set to begin. In a statement after the drone strike Friday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said a delegation had planned to travel Saturday morning to extend a formal invitation to Taliban leaders to meet for talks. \u201cThe drone strike in North Waziristan is a conspiracy to sabotage the peace talks with the Taliban,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe were about to send a three-member delegation to the Taliban.\u201d Khan added that it was \u201ctoo early to say anything\u201d about whether Hakimullah had been killed. \u201cWe are still receiving initial reports,\u201d he said. The strike could also undermine relations between the United States and Pakistan just a week after Sharif and Obama met at the White House and pledged closer cooperation between the two countries. Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement late Friday strongly condemning the latest strike, saying such attacks \u201cset dangerous precedents\u201d for foreign ties. \u201cThese drone strikes have a negative impact on the mutual desire of both countries to forge a cordial and cooperative relationship and to ensure peace and stability in the region,\u201d it said. On Friday, the senior political leader in Pakistan\u2019s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, former international cricket star Imran Khan, threatened to cut off NATO supply routes through the province if U.S. drone strikes interfered with the peace process. \n Shaiq Hussain contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Tim Craig and Haq Nawaz Khan", "wordCount": 528}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In volatile Congo, a new U.N. force with teeth", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/333782e3/sc/20/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cafrica0Cin0Evolatile0Econgo0Ea0Enew0Eun0Eforce0Ewith0Eteeth0C20A130C110C0A10C0Acda650Ac0E423f0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "Kilimanyoke, Congo \u2014 With shells flying overhead, the Congolese soldiers pressed forward on a desolate stretch of road near the Rwandan border. Ahead of them was a rebel army, firing relentlessly. Behind them, a new U.N. combat brigade waited in white armored vehicles, ready to serve as backup. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The U.N. soldiers are in Congo with an ambitious goal: to reverse the trajectory of one of the world\u2019s most horrific and complex conflicts, one that has killed more than 5 million people since 1998, the deadliest war since World War II. They are also here to rescue the image of the troubled U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Congo.  \u201cTo be a peacekeeper doesn\u2019t mean you need to be passive,\u201d a top commander, Gen. Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, said hours before the offensive began. \u201cTo be a peacekeeper, you need to take action. The way to protect the civilians is to take action. If you see the history of atrocities here, it justifies action.\u201d Inaction is precisely what the U.N. mission here has been criticized for in the 14 years since the United Nations dispatched soldiers to Congo, the first members of what has become the largest peacekeeping force in U.N. history. Now, the U.N. Security Council has launched the Forward Intervention Brigade in a bold attempt to defeat the dozens of militias that pillage this mineral-rich central African country, which is roughly the size of Western Europe. The brigade, composed of 3,000 soldiers, is the United Nations\u2019 first offensive combat force and is seen as a possible model for defusing crises in other chaotic parts of the world. But the force is also an unparalleled gamble for the United Nations that challenges the basic principles of peacekeeping. It has orders to react offensively to enforce peace, essentially transforming peacekeepers into combatants. And it is openly supporting Congolese government forces, a move away from the principle of neutrality that has guided other U.N. missions. That could affect the United Nations\u2019 ability to negotiate peace deals with the militias and risks deepening conflicts. Humanitarian agencies are worried that Congo\u2019s brutal militias could see the entire U.N. mission, which also includes aid workers, monitors and civilian experts, as non-neutral potential targets. There are also concerns that the U.N. force is propping up a corrupt government and aiding an undisciplined military that has a history of human-rights abuses, including mass rapes. Many Congolese remain skeptical of the new brigade\u2019s potential to eradicate the militias. Others have lofty expectations that could bring disappointment and further antagonism toward the U.N. mission. But senior U.N. civilian and military officials, as well as some analysts, say the brigade could be the United Nations\u2019 best chance to help bring meaningful change, and perhaps even a sustainable peace, to Congo. This week, the Congolese and U.N. forces pushed the rebels of the M23 movement out of major towns, including their last primary stronghold of Bunagana, near the Ugandan border. The remarkably swift military defeat of the rebels, who only last year briefly seized the eastern city of Goma, represented the first significant victory for the force.   \u201cEverybody is impatient,\u201d said Martin Kobler, the special U.N. envoy to Congo. \u201cThe atrocities going on, the rapes of women and the use of child soldiers, this is just unacceptable. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good development to have the intervention brigade here. This is teeth.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Years of conflict \n Congo has been plagued by conflict since the fall of its longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 following an ethnic rebellion triggered by the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. A succession of rebel militias have fought over the eastern part of the country, bordering Rwanda and Uganda, and its valuable resources, which including vast deposits of tin, gold and coltan, an ore that yields elements used in cellphones and laptops. In 1999, the United Nations launched an observer mission here. Confronted with a bloody conflict that became known as Africa\u2019s first \u201cworld war,\u201d involving nine nations and dozens of rebel groups, the mission was steadily enlarged and its mandate expanded. But the peacekeepers remained unable or unwilling to prevent rebel groups from killing, raping and terrorizing the population or from seizing entire towns in eastern Congo. \u201cThe population was expecting a solution from the U.N. for many years, but there was not even the beginning of a solution,\u201d said Gautier Muhindo Misonia, a human rights activist and president of a collection of local nongovernmental organizations. \n Kobler said that without the peacekeepers, the country would have been gripped by more violence and instability. The primary responsibility for bringing peace, said Kobler, lay with the Congolese government. For more than a year, the highest-profile rebel militia has been the M23 movement. It was launched in April 2012 by disaffected Congolese soldiers who wanted the government to honor the terms of a 2009 peace deal following a previous rebellion. U.N. investigators allege that Rwanda is financing and arming the rebels, who are mostly Tutsis, the same ethnicity as the Rwandan leadership. Rwanda has publicly denied the allegation. Last year, several hundred M23 rebels seized Goma for 10 days before withdrawing voluntarily, embarrassing the U.N. mission. That prompted France\u2019s foreign minister to declare it \u201cabsurd\u201d that 17,000 U.N. soldiers could not protect the city, and he urged a review of the U.N. mandate. Massive demonstrations erupted in Goma, and U.N. vehicles were stoned. On Twitter, critics began referring to the mission, whose name is abbreviated in French as MONUSCO, with the hashtag #MONUSELESS. The capture of Goma prompted the U.N. Security Council to approve the intervention brigade this year, giving it a mandate to \u201cneutralize\u201d all of Congo\u2019s militias. The force, made up of troops from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania, became operational this summer. In late August, the brigade went into action for the first time, backing Congolese government forces by firing artillery shells at M23 rebel positions a few miles north of Goma in the town of Kibati. The fighting drove the rebels back a few miles, preventing them from shelling Goma and convincing them to enter peace talks in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, in September.   Still, many Congolese are unconvinced that the brigade, known as FIB here, would be different from other U.N. peacekeeping forces. Two days after the Kibati clashes, an angry crowd stormed the U.N. mission\u2019s base in Goma claiming the United Nations had not done enough to protect them. Two protesters were killed in the chaos and a U.N. car was reportedly set on fire. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t During a routine patrol last week through the streets of Goma, the intervention brigade was taunted by residents: \u201cYou have no job. You have no job.\u201d \u201cThe population is questioning whether 3,000 soldiers from the FIB can do a job that 17,000 U.N. peacekeepers have failed to accomplish,\u201d said Danny Kayege, a historian. \u201cThe population does not have any confidence in them.\u201d \n\n In Kilimanyoke last week , some Congolese soldiers dismissed the new brigade\u2019s fighting capabilities. \u201cThey stand behind us and shell. But we are the ones fighting on the front line, face to face with the enemy,\u201d said Jean Luc Basunga, a Congolese government soldier. \u201cEven if the FIB doesn\u2019t help us, we can defeat the enemy.\u201d But in a visit to Kibati last week, most residents interviewed said the new brigade was more committed to protecting them than other U.N. peacekeepers have been. \u201cThe FIB is not like the other MONUSCO soldiers,\u201d said Nsengiyunva Mudyango, 35, a farmer, standing near several destroyed houses. \u201cI see they are strong, and here to help us.\u201d \n More challenges ahead \n Even with the capture of Bunagana and the possible demise of M23 as a military force, many challenges remain for the intervention brigade and the U.N. mission. The country\u2019s political institutions are crumbling, corruption and poverty is widespread and ethnic divisions run deep. U.N. officials say a political solution is still the best path forward, but in a phone interview last week, Amani Kabasha, the rebels\u2019 political spokesman, said his group had lost trust in the U.N. mission because it was supporting Congolese forces. \u201cEven if they kill all of the M23, another group will rise in our place,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe are survivors. We will never surrender to our cause.\u201d The intervention brigade is expected to go after more than 40 other militias who are committing atrocities, stealing Congo\u2019s mineral wealth and preventing the government from functioning \u2014 a task that seems virtually impossible. There is also the problem of perception. The Enough Project, a human-rights group, said in a report last week that the brigade \u201crisks being seen, or being used, as a pawn of Kinshasa,\u201d the capital. Both Kobler and Cruz said the brigade would not work with any Congolese army units that have committed human-rights abuses. They also said the brigade would work at times on its own. U.N. and other humanitarian aid workers said in interviews that they remain worried about the new brigade. \u201cThe presence of the FIB is a problem for all the humanitarian actors,\u201d said Francesca Mangia, the head of Doctors Without Borders France in Goma. \u201cWhen the population sees a white car, they don\u2019t differentiate between whether it is us, the U.N. or FIB. It makes us military targets. \u201c Near the front line, the significance of their mission was not lost on members of the intervention brigade. Maj. Vic Vrolik, their South African commander, said that eliminating the M23 was the first step to \u201cstart concentrating on the other armed groups.\u201d \u201cIf we succeed, it will show that the U.N. can solve problems in war-torn areas,\u201d he said.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Sudarsan Raghavan", "wordCount": 1576}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Germany looks at keeping its Internet, e-mail traffic inside its borders", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/332ed348/sc/21/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Ceurope0Cgermany0Elooks0Eat0Ekeeping0Eits0Einternet0Ee0Email0Etraffic0Einside0Eits0Eborders0C20A130C10A0C310C98110A4fe0E424f0E11e30Ea7510Ef0A32898f2dbc0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "BERLIN \u2014 The news that the National Security Agency has its eye on much of the world\u2019s electronic communications has shocked Germans who have memories of Nazi and Cold War-era spying. Now, an alliance of German phone and Internet companies claims it has a solution: German e-mail and Internet, transmitted within German borders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The proposals \u2014 one for Internet, one for e-mail \u2014 aim to boost the security of Germany\u2019s internal communications by preventing them from bouncing outside the country, which has far stricter privacy regulations than the United States. If a German customer wants to call up a German Web site, there is no reason the data must pass through a server in Virginia, exposing the information to potential surveillance along the way, the advocates say. The same goes for e-mails within Germany. Some security professionals say the efforts are little more than a marketing gimmick, since Germans would still want to surf American Web pages \u2014 Facebook, anyone? \u2014 and the Germany-only plans wouldn\u2019t make doing so any more secure. The NSA could also still theoretically access German data on German soil, as could Germany\u2019s own intelligence agencies. But for Germans who have been infuriated by a steady drip-drop of NSA allegations, including that Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cellphone had been monitored for more than a decade, the initiatives may be attractive. And in the United States, technology industry advocates say they are bracing for tough competition from foreign companies that boast they are freer from U.S. intrusion and monitoring than American counterparts. \u201cYou have to make sure that your data is exclusively stored in Germany, on German ground,\u201d said Jan Oetjen, the chief executive of GMX, one of Germany\u2019s largest e-mail companies, which has teamed with the two other top German e-mail companies to offer a service called \u201cE-Mail made in Germany.\u201d \u201cGermans tend to be very sensitive to the use of their data, I think due to German history. Germans get taught at school to be cautious of a super-powerful state,\u201d he said. Google\u2019s and Yahoo \u2019s main bridges to the Internet were cracked by the NSA , allowing full access to all the traffic passing through them, according to documents leaked to The Washington Post by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. And, also based on Snowden documents, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported this week that spying was being conducted from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, just steps from the Brandenburg Gate. The efforts to nationalize Internet traffic go beyond Germany. In Brazil, where President Dilma Rousseff was also allegedly monitored by the NSA, the government has pushed to require U.S. companies to store data about Brazilian customers inside Brazil. European Union leaders have advocated that their 28 nations develop \u201ccloud\u201d data storage that is independent from the United States. The accusation last week that the NSA had monitored Merkel\u2019s cellphone was for some Germans the final blow to an already strained alliance. Both U.S. and German officials have said privately that relations as a result may be the worst they have been in a decade, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was a firm opponent of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.  \n Unpleasant memories \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Part of the problem, analysts say, is that the revelations stir up memories of surveillance by the Nazis and by the fearsome Stasi, the secret police of Communist East Germany, who tapped phones, read correspondence, and jailed and tortured people based on the information they uncovered. Another issue is that Germans feel that Americans have treated them with tremendous distrust. \u201cGoodbye, Friends!\u201d read the lead headline Thursday in the weekly Die Zeit newspaper. The front page featured a heart, broken in two, with the U.S. flag on one half and the German flag on the other. \u201c The U.S. secret service has treated the chancellor as if she was an enemy herself,\u201d Heinrich Wefing wrote in the lead article. \u201cThis is exactly why \u2018cellphone-gate\u2019 marks a fundamental rupture.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n Suspicions that the U.S. government is examining every scrap of data handed to \n American Internet companies may also have tough economic consequences, analysts say. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a very negative trajectory where consumers and businesses, especially foreign businesses, will be reluctant to use U.S. services,\u201d said Daniel Castro, an analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group that is funded in part by the technology industry. Castro published a report in August estimating that U.S. data cloud providers could lose $21.5 billion to $35 billion in business over the next three years. \n\n In Germany, Deutsche Telekom, the country\u2019s largest Internet and telephone company, is collaborating on the e-mail project. In October, it also unveiled an effort to keep German Internet traffic within the country as much as possible. It asked its competitors to sign agreements to route information between German senders and recipients on exclusively German data lines. Data from and to the United States and other countries would flow as usual. \n \n\n \n\n \u201cIt would be much more difficult for foreign intelligence services to get the traffic if it were routed within Germany,\u201d said Philipp Blank, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom. \n\n \n\n The company, which is 32 percent owned by the German government, has received praise from top German officials, who have said they would consider legislation to ensure that the initiative happens. German privacy and eavesdropping laws require court approval for each individual eavesdropping target, meaning that German intelligence agencies are prohibited from doing large-scale, indiscriminate data collection such as that done by the NSA. \n\n \n \u201cWe must make our own networks safer,\u201d Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said in a Wednesday interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper. \u201cWhy should an e-mail from Munich to Berlin run through the USA? We need an autonomous European Internet infrastructure.\u201d \n\n \n A marketing ploy? \n \n\n But security analysts in Germany and elsewhere question whether the initiatives will truly protect users, and Deutsche Telekom\u2019s competitors have largely dismissed the Internet effort as an attempt to win market share without providing major security gains. \n\n Routing German Internet traffic within Germany \u201cmakes it a little more difficult for the NSA to look into our data,\u201d said Norbert Pohlmann , the director of the Institute for Internet Security at the Westphalia University of Applied Sciences in Gelsenkirchen. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a solution to the problem we have at the moment with the NSA.

But questions remained about how and where that would be possible. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The suggestion came the same day that Germany\u2019s top security official said he was open to making it possible to take testimony from Snowden about allegations that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cellphone for more than 10 years. Snowden has been living in Russia, which granted him temporary asylum for a year after the United States revoked his passport.  Snowden\u2019s apparent interest in going to Germany \u2014 if the country could give him assurances it would grant him shelter and not send him on to the United States \u2014 puts Merkel into a tight spot. German voters are furious with the U.S. government over the spying revelations, and allowing Snowden into Germany would be a popular move. But the Obama administration has made clear that it is willing to go to great lengths to retrieve Snowden \u2014 including, said Bolivian President Evo Morales this summer, forcing the leader of a sovereign country to make an emergency landing because of suspicions that Snowden was on his jet. Some German officials voiced discomfort Friday at being trapped between the two sides. \u201cIf there were the possibility to hear Snowden as a witness \u2014 without bringing him into danger and completely ruining the German-USA relationship \u2014 we should use it,\u201d said Thomas Oppermann, a Social Democrat who heads the parliamentary intelligence oversight committee, on Twitter. German lawmakers appeared split about how best to proceed, although many seemed interested in hearing from Snowden even if he does not step foot in Berlin. \u201cIf Mr. Snowden is willing to talk with German officials, we will find ways to make this conversation possible,\u201d German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Die Zeit newspaper. \u201cAny enlightenment, all information and facts that we can get, is good.\u201d Friedrich also said this week that if U.S. diplomats were found to have been complicit in spying on Germany, they should be expelled. In a letter that Snowden gave German lawmaker Hans-Christian Stroebele on Thursday, Snowden wrote that he was interested in speaking out further about what he sees as instances of overreaching by the U.S. intelligence establishment, but that the U.S. government had forced him into \u201cexile.\u201d In the letter, which was addressed \u201cto whom it may concern\u201d but which Stroebele said was intended for Merkel and Germany\u2019s chief prosecutor, Snowden wrote , \u201cI look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved\u201d \u2014 a reference to the felony charges against him in the United States. Stroebele, a veteran member of the opposition Greens and the longest-serving lawmaker on the parliamentary intelligence oversight committee, told reporters in Berlin on Friday that he believed it was possible for Snowden to testify if German lawmakers had the \u201ccourage\u201d to make it so. Snowden \u201ccan imagine coming to Germany if it is assured that afterwards he will be able to stay in Germany or a similar country and will be safe there,\u201d Stroebele said. \u201cThat means, legally speaking, safe passage, and then asylum or a right to residence. .\u2009.\u2009. Under these circumstances, if all this is clarified, he would be willing to come here.\u201d Stroebele said Snowden was wary about testifying inside Russia. \u201cHe is having strong doubts, which I cannot and must not explain further, but which one can imagine,\u201d Stroebele said. Snowden\u2019s Kremlin-friendly Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told the Interfax news service Friday that the American was \u201cfree to decide whom to talk to and when,\u201d including German lawmakers. But he also made clear that Snowden would lose his status in Russia if he were to leave the country and said that the American had not released any new secrets since he arrived in Russia. The lawyer said Thursday that Snowden has taken a job at a major Russian Internet firm, although he did not say which one. Stroebele said that he had arranged the secretive visit to Snowden directly with him and that he had not coordinated it with Russian officials. Stroebele and two German reporters were picked up by a van with tinted windows and brought to Snowden, he said. He added that he left his cellphone in his hotel room and that he did not know where Snowden was living. Asked a question about Snowden\u2019s life in Moscow, the German lawmaker said he could not answer in detail \u2014 but that the American had said he was free to go shopping. \n Petra Krischok contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Michael Birnbaum", "wordCount": 764}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "WorldViews: \u2018They just can\u2019t get it done\u2019: A report card for post-withdrawal Iraq", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/3333d28c/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cblogpost0Cpost0Cthey0Ejust0Ecant0Eget0Eit0Edone0Ea0Ereport0Ecard0Efor0Epost0Ewithdrawal0Eiraq0C20A130C110C0A10Cdb0A454fa0E433a0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Max Fisher", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "WorldViews: How anti-NSA backlash could fracture the Internet along national borders", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/33324bb3/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cblogpost0Cpost0Chow0Eanti0Ensa0Ebacklash0Ecould0Efracture0Ethe0Einternet0Ealong0Enational0Eborders0C20A130C110C0A10C86e6bcd80E43160E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Max Fisher", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In Britain, era of \u2018green Conservative\u2019 withers", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636708/s/3331b19c/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cin0Ebritain0Eera0Eof0Egreen0Econservative0Ewithers0C20A130C110C0A10C2a0Aea2fe0E424f0E11e30Eb0A280Ede922d7a3f470Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Iworld/story01.htm", "text": "LONDON \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron once dog-sledded across a shrinking Norwegian glacier to showcase his concern for global warming. Now, environmentalists say, his pledge to lead a new era of the \u201cGreen Conservative\u201d is in danger of melting away. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Cameron\u2019s troubled road on the environment illustrates the potential pitfalls ahead for any Republican leader who might try to emulate his grab for the political center. Even as he maintains a tough stance on fiscal discipline, Cameron has sought to appeal to moderates by supporting issues ranging from gay marriage to combating climate change. But he has paid with a series of political backlashes that have, at times, forced him to curtail his ambitions.  In few areas is that more true, environmentalists say, than on the issue of climate change. The latest blow, they say, came when Cameron recently called for a rollback of \u201cgreen taxes\u201d in British energy bills that help pay for, among other things, better insulation in low-income homes and subsidies for alternative energies. Cameron did not elaborate on his idea. But advocates described it as the latest setback on what he once promised would be the \u201cgreenest\u201d government in British history. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed at the opportunities wasted and the risks ahead for green policy,\u201d said Alastair Harper, head of politics at the Green Alliance, Britain\u2019s largest environmental think tank. \u201cThere is a way for Conservatives to show they care about the climate change and the environment, but at the moment, they are not able or willing to articulate a way forward.\u201d Some on the right point to a number of green milestones in which Cameron\u2019s support has set new benchmarks for a Conservative-led government. His government is backing, for example, a bill aimed at reforming and updating Britain\u2019s energy sector that could generate millions of dollars\u2019 worth of new \u201cgreen\u201d investment by guaranteeing minimum prices for wind and other types of renewables. A \u201ccarbon budget\u201d for Britain approved last year with the government\u2019s support also sticks to legally binding targets for cutting carbon emissions by the middle of the century. But Cameron, they concede, is also facing a conundrum \u2013 how to remain true to his word to be \u201cgreen\u201d while addressing Conservative concerns that the threat from climate change is being overstated even as green policies weigh on consumers\u2019 pocketbooks and the British economy. \u201cDavid Cameron said he wanted to lead the greenest government ever, and he accepted quite challenging targets for cutting greenhouse gas admissions,\u201d said Tim Yeo, a Conservative member of Parliament involved in energy policy. \u201cBut now he finds the cost of some of those policies to meet those targets is raising an issue about energy bills. So if he wants to do more for consumers, he\u2019s likely going to have to sacrifice some of his green credentials.\u201d \n Behaving \u2018more conservative\u2019 \n At the same time, his critics are charging Cameron with a long list of green disappointments. Since taking office almost four years ago, Cameron has been far less vocal on climate change than a string of other world leaders, including President Obama or even Chinese President Xi Jinping. Some Conservatives here are also now angling to water down Britain\u2019s emission goals and arguing against adhering to ambitious guidelines set by the European Union.   Environmentalists, meanwhile, have been horrified to see the elevation of officials they view as climate change skeptics to key government positions. Last year, for instance, Cameron named Owen Paterson as secretary for the Environment and Rural Affairs. In September, Paterson issued the latest in a series of comments arguing against overreaction to climate change, saying Britons should remember that \u201cfor humans, the biggest cause of death is cold in winter, far bigger than heat in summer.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Analysts say Cameron\u2019s moves are at least in part a response to demands from his right wing that he start behaving \u201cmore conservative\u201d in the face of a growing threat: the United Kingdom Independence Party. A political force that has been winning over disenfranchised voters on the political right in local elections, UKIP is viewed by many as a major threat to the Conservative Party\u2019s chances in the next elections.  \u201cThe economic downturn and the emergence of UKIP have started to worry a lot of Conservative backbenchers,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy director for climate change at the London School of Economics, referring to the rank and file members of Parliament. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a worrying line coming out from Conservatives suggesting that climate change targets are threatening economic growth in the U.K.\u201d \n \u2018Green taxes\u2019 rollback \n Last week, environmentalists cried foul when Cameron called for a roll back in the \u201cgreen taxes\u201d that help pay for insulating British homes and subsidizing renewable energies but add as much as 9 percent annually to British electricity bills. Downing Street officials would not elaborate on the prime minister\u2019s plan. But some Conservatives are backing an idea to roll back or eliminate green taxes currently fixed to power bills, while potentially making up for at least some of the lost revenue by increasing taxes elsewhere. Environmentalists, however, counter that green taxes were attached to energy bills precisely so that they could act as a disincentive to power consumption and lead consumers to reduce their carbon footprints. In comments last week, Cameron sought to defend his record: \u201cI think this has been a very sound government in terms of the environment, but we do have to make progress on this issue of energy and electricity prices, and there are some plain facts that we have to deal with,\u201d Cameron said during a press conference. His move came as the opposition Labor leader, Ed Miliband, has scored big political points in recent weeks by tapping into public anger over fast-rising energy bills. For his part, Miliband, has floated a plan to freeze energy bills for two years should Labor win the next elections. Even John Major, the last Conservative prime minister before Cameron, has called for an emergency tax on rising profits at energy companies. Cameron\u2019s call to roll back green taxes has also brought him into direct confrontation with the junior members of his coalition government, the centrist Liberal Democrats, who have vowed to block any attempt to decouple green taxes from power bills. It comes a time of growing strains within the coalition and is further dividing two parties that always made strange bed-fellows. \u201cI am not going to give up on renewable energy,\u201d Ed Davey, Britain\u2019s energy secretary and a Liberal Democrat, told the Guardian this week. \u201cThey are not going to touch it.\u201d \n Karla Adam contributed to this report.", "topics": ["world"], "author": "Anthony Faiola", "wordCount": 1084}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "WorldViews: Washington thinks pro-Israel groups are all-powerful.

The reigning Hart Trophy winner is expected back in the lineup Tuesday night against the Islanders after missing two games with a right shoulder injury, so the Capitals can afford to smile. Washington will need the league\u2019s third-leading goal scorer (in the fewest games, 12, of any player in the top 20) if it hopes to turn the weekend\u2019s stabilizing wins into a much-needed hot streak. \u201cTo win two games, it\u2019s right now scary to go back to the line and mess up the lines, you know?\u201d said Ovechkin, who watched his teammates explode for seven goals against the Flyers before surviving the Panthers in a shootout over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Ovechkin suffered the unspecified shoulder injury in last week\u2019s game against Vancouver when he was tripped by Canucks defenseman Alexander Edler and fell hard into goaltender Roberto Luongo. The 28-year-old practiced fully Monday after a hard, shooting-filled skate Saturday morning, and said that he and the Capitals\u2019 training staff decided he\u2019s \u201cprobably going to play\u201d Tuesday. Coach Adam Oates wouldn\u2019t commit just yet, though, declaring Ovechkin a \u201cgame-time decision\u201d against the Islanders at Verizon Center. \u201cHe feels obviously a lot better, he got through a full practice, and we just make sure [Tuesday] everything\u2019s okay,\u201d Oates said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t play him if I thought it was something that could linger. .\u2009.\u2009. It doesn\u2019t make sense to play a guy right now with something that\u2019s lingering, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201d While Ovechkin may have been joking about \u201cmessing up the lines,\u201d his return does require a reshuffling of trios that had allowed previously underutilized Erat to build a rapport with Nicklas Backstrom as the top line\u2019s left wing, a combination the Capitals had been searching for this year after Marcus Johansson hasn\u2019t clicked quite as well in that slot as he did down the stretch last season. Erat, a consistent 20-goals-a-year, top-six forward when healthy, had been limited to fourth-line ice time for the first month of the season until moving to the first line after Ovechkin\u2019s injury. He tallied two of his five points this season with two assists Friday, one of which set up a Backstrom goal. Oates changed his lines for Monday\u2019s practice in anticipation of Ovechkin\u2019s return, dropping Erat back to the fourth line in favor of Brooks Laich at first-line left wing. That move initially garnered confusion before Oates explained that Erat was \u201ca little beat up\u201d after Saturday\u2019s win over the Panthers, and that he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d skate for the entire practice, so he slid him off the top line. Oates wouldn\u2019t commit to Erat at left wing against the Islanders, but the 32-year-old seemed wholly unconcerned about his line placement after practice, saying he\u2019d spoken to his coach prior to practice and that was \u201call good.\u201d If Tuesday\u2019s lines do feature Laich as top-line left winger \u2014 a move he said he wasn\u2019t expecting before showing up to practice \u2014 Ovechkin may wish he\u2019d never made the suggestion that the Capitals could move on without him. \u201cI saw [Ovechkin] this morning and I saw the lines and I said to him, \u2018Ovi, whenever you get the puck, just think: give it to me,\u2019\u201d Laich said. \u201cHe just started laughing. I was obviously joking.\u201d \n\n Capitals note: Forward Jason Chimera tallied a league-leading six points last week on two goals and four assists, a performance that earned him the NHL\u2019s third star of the week honor along with first star Jason Pominville of the Wild and second star Marc-Andre Fleury of the Penguins. Three of Chimera\u2019s assists came to Joel Ward, who recorded a hat trick Friday night, tying Chimera\u2019s career-high total for helpers in a single game, accomplished first in 2007.", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Chelsea Janes", "wordCount": 658}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Washington Redskins running game keyed offense in victory over San Diego Chargers", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/334c9432/sc/13/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Credskins0Cwashington0Eredskins0Erunning0Egame0Ekeyed0Eoffense0Ein0Evictory0Eover0Esan0Ediego0Echargers0C20A130C110C0A40C1fb89b260E45aa0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "The Washington Redskins got their groove back on offense Sunday thanks to a renewed emphasis on the running game, accompanied by a number of creative wrinkles from offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan\u2019s playbook. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t For the second time this season, the Redskins ran the ball at least 40 times and topped the 200-yard mark on the ground en route to victory. Washington had 40 carries for 209 yards in the 30-24 overtime win over San Diego . The only other time the Redskins\u2019 run game eclipsed the 40-carry, 200-yard mark came on Oct. 20 against Chicago, when they had 43 carries for 209 yards in a 45-41 win over the Bears . The Bears game saw the return of Robert Griffin III as a weapon in the zone-read attack. His 11 carries for 84 yards in Week 7 complemented Alfred Morris\u2019s 19-carry, 95-yard effort, and Roy Helu Jr. served as a third weapon with 11 carries for 41 yards and three touchdowns. On Sunday, Morris had his best game of the season, carrying the ball 25 times for 121 yards and a touchdown. Another five players combined for 88 more rushing yards. The Redskins again broke out the option attack against the Chargers, but they added a twist, using the triple option to keep their opponents off balance. Three times Washington went to the triple option \u2014 first on Washington\u2019s third offensive play when Griffin drew safety Eric Weddle to him and then pitched to tight end Jordan Reed, who had come in motion, set up in the backfield and proceeded to pick up 18 yards on the play. In the third quarter, the Redskins went back to the play, but this time using slot receiver Santana Moss, who trailed Griffin as he rolled out to the right, drew safety Marcus Gilchrist to him and then pitched to Moss, who also picked up 18 yards on his run. \u201cWe were just trying to switch it up,\u201d Griffin said of the plays. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out there and have people know what you\u2019re doing all the time, so as an offense, you have to switch things up, keep the defense off balance and that\u2019s what we did as an offense. The one thing you don\u2019t want to do is become predictable. Whenever we\u2019ve been on throughout the whole season, we\u2019ve done a better job of just mixing things up \u2013 run, pass, giving them different looks. Give them something to think about.\u201d Until Sunday, the Redskins hadn\u2019t featured much of the triple-option attack since last season. They had shown that look a couple of times this season, but didn\u2019t run any of the pitches. But that didn\u2019t represent the only wrinkle added to the playbook this week. The Redskins also sported a couple of unbalanced line formations against San Diego. On one play, tight end Logan Paulsen line up at the end of the line next to left guard Kory Lichtensteiger and left tackle Trent Williams lined up at the opposite end, next to right tackle Tyler Polumbus. Chargers defenders appeared to be keying on the right side of the line, but Washington ran a handoff to Morris, who ran through a hole created by Paulsen and Lichtensteiger on the left side and gained 26 yards \u2014 his longest run of the game. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the game plan,\u201d Coach Mike Shanahan said. \u201cThe key is to have it in your offense. You don\u2019t have to run it a lot, but if you do have it in there and you feel like it\u2019s going well, you can keep on running it. And if not, it\u2019ll open something else. I think the more you can do as an offense to keep people off-balance, the better off you are.\u201d With an effective running game, Washington\u2019s pass attack benefitted. The Chargers didn\u2019t blitz as aggressively as other opponents have because they had to respect the run, and for the first time all season, the Redskins\u2019 offensive line didn\u2019t surrender a sack. Griffin completed a season-best 71.9 percent of his passes. The Redskins also excelled on third downs \u2014 usually an area of weakness this season \u2014 converting 12 of 17 attempts for first downs. Griffin completed 6 of 10 third-down passes for first downs, and he also had a 10-yard run on third and nine. \u201cThe great quarterbacks are the guys that are consistent on third down, and I thought Robert had his best game of the year,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cAny time that you\u2019re over 70 percent in third down conversions, your quarterback is playing extremely well. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Mike Jones", "wordCount": 757}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Washington Wizards have 0-3 record for fifth time in last seven seasons", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/334c92cb/sc/35/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Cwizards0Cwashington0Ewizards0Ehave0E0A0E30Erecord0Efor0Efifth0Etime0Ein0Elast0Eseven0Eseasons0C20A130C110C0A40C440A8a53e0E45a50E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "The head coach\u2019s wallet is $20,000 lighter after he was fined for cursing his team\u2019s effort on defense \u2014 after the second game of the season.

In the 10 seasons since Ernie Grunfeld took over as general manager, the Wizards have had a winning record after three games only three times. Even in their most recent playoff season, in 2007-08, the team started 0-5 before going on to finish the regular season 43-39.  \u201cThere is still a lot of things we can improve on, and we will improve on, it\u2019s early in the season,\u201d second-year shooting guard Bradley Beal said. \u201cWe still got a lot of strides to make. We\u2019ve got more than enough time to do it.\u201d Beal is third on the team in scoring at 15.3 points per game but he has gotten off to a rough start shooting. He has missed 34 of his 50 field goal attempts and leads the team with 13 turnovers, which has resulted in a personal efficiency rating of 3.7, nearly 11 points below the league average. Teams have crowded the 20-year-old Beal and gotten physical with him, but he\u2019s confident that he can adjust. \u201cWhat frustrates me is the fact that I can\u2019t get the shot that I necessarily want,\u201d Beal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of respect. But it\u2019s a sign that I need to learn to move without the ball more and find my teammates as well. I was moving to the open spots and just shooting with confidence.\u201d The NBA fined Wittman on Monday for using coarse language on Friday to explain that the Wizards lost their first two games because of a failure to commit on defense. The Wizards entered Monday\u2019s games ranked last in the NBA in opponent\u2019s field goal percentage (51.2) and 29th in points allowed per game (108.3) . But after the Wizards allowed the two-time defending champion Miami Heat to shoot 52.9 percent from the field during a 103-93 loss on Sunday , Wittman praised his players for sticking to his defensive principles. The Wizards held Miami to 36 points in the paint after surrendering 130 in the first two games. LeBron James \u201chit three threes, one a step-back. I would rather have him taking that shot than taking us to the basket,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cThey made some shots. Sometimes you got to tip your hat to the other team. I don\u2019t think it was so much our defense. We got them to take perimeter shots and kept them out of the paint and they knocked them down. That\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Injuries, too are going to happen and they have already cost Nene two games after he strained his left calf in the season opener against Detroit. When the pain spread to his Achilles\u2019 tendon, Nene decided that he should get an MRI exam to make sure the injury isn\u2019t too serious. He has been an almost indispensable piece for the Wizards since he arrived from Denver in a 2012 trade, with the team going 7-30 when he is unable to play. Forward Trevor Booker said his injured finger, which bent back awkwardly in Miami, is \u201cfine.\u201d John Wall hasn\u2019t missed any time because of his back problems but he recently accepted responsibility for the franchise\u2019s latest slow start. \u201cIt starts with me. I\u2019m the head of the snake on defense and offense,\u201d said Wall, who leads the team with 19 points and 8.7 assists per game. \u201cWe know what we\u2019ve got to do. It\u2019s play defense. That\u2019s what our team is. We ain\u2019t playing no defense and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t win no games.\u201d", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Michael Lee", "wordCount": 854}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Josh Smith ready to travel with Georgetown basketball to face Oregon in South Korea", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/334dec61/sc/35/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Ccolleges0Cjosh0Esmith0Eready0Eto0Etravel0Ewith0Egeorgetown0Ebasketball0Eto0Eface0Eoregon0Ein0Esouth0Ekorea0C20A130C110C0A40Cdfafcd240E45ae0E11e30Ebf0Ac0Ecebf37c6f4840Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "When Georgetown tips off its 2013-14 basketball season Friday in South Korea, it will have been nearly a year \u2014 348 days, to be precise \u2014 since Josh Smith last appeared in a college lineup. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t That\u2019s the longest Smith recalls going without playing a competitive game. And as he and his fellow Hoyas prepare for their season opener against No. 19 Oregon, to be played at Camp Humphreys, a U.S. military base, the 6-foot-10 Smith said Monday that he considered himself \u201cblessed\u201d to be able to take part. The prodigiously gifted center transferred from UCLA last January. He learned just two weeks ago that NCAA officials had cleared him to compete for the full season, ending his mandated time on the sideline sooner than expected. In a departure from traditional practice, the NCAA also granted him two seasons of eligibility despite the fact that he played six games for the Bruins as a junior \u2014 a ruling that, in effect, extended his college career to 4 1 / \n 2 seasons. \u201cKnowing that I can play, it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders,\u201d Smith told reporters at McDonough Arena, where the Hoyas held one last practice before boarding the 14-hour flight to South Korea on Tuesday. \u201cI really love this team, I love this university and I love playing here. I haven\u2019t played a game since I don\u2019t remember, and just being able to go to South Korea and play Oregon, a team I\u2019m used to, it\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d Coach John Thompson III wouldn\u2019t say whether Smith would start against Oregon or speculate about how many minutes he would play. But he voiced satisfaction with Smith\u2019s progress these last months \u2014 particularly in terms of his fitness and conditioning, which was his undoing at UCLA. \u201cHe\u2019s not where he needs to be,\u201d Thompson said, \u201cbut he\u2019s working hard, and he\u2019s getting there.\u201d A former McDonald\u2019s all-American, Smith has practiced and worked out with the Hoyas for nearly a year. The result, said senior guard Markel Starks, is a player who is in far better shape than he was this time a year ago, when Georgetown toppled UCLA at Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center in what proved the waning days of Smith\u2019s career with the Bruins. \u201cHe\u2019s in a lot better shape,\u201d Starks said. \u201cHow he looks running \u2014 he looks a lot better. Everybody is concerned about his weight; we\u2019re more concerned about his productivity, and he has been consistent every single day. Just looking at him right now, he looks 20 pounds lighter to me.\u201d Smith, who\u2019s listed at 350 pounds, declined to say where his weight stands but attested to a difference on court. \u201cI\u2019ve just noticed a really, really big change from being able to go just a little bit in practice to now being able to go full practice and feel better running up and down the floor,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019m on step to get there.\u201d Given the void left by Otto Porter Jr., who led the Hoyas in points (16.3), rebounds (7.4) and minutes per game (35.4), Georgetown sorely needs Smith\u2019s big body, scoring ability and passing skill. And with a tough nonconference schedule in store, his services are needed at the outset. Oregon, which finished 28-9 last season, is one of three currently ranked teams the Hoyas are scheduled to face outside the Big East, along with No. 5 Kansas (Dec. 21) and No. 2 Michigan State (Feb. 1). Depending how the Puerto Rico Classic unfolds, the Hoyas could also face No. 7 Michigan and No. 14 Virginia Commonwealth.", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Liz Clarke", "wordCount": 585}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Frank Beamer backs Logan Thomas as starting quarterback at Virginia Tech", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/334cb5c3/sc/35/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Ccolleges0Cfrank0Ebeamer0Ebacks0Elogan0Ethomas0Eas0Estarting0Equarterback0Eat0Evirginia0Etech0C20A130C110C0A40C43fbb440A0E41be0E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "BLACKSBURG, Va. \u2014 Coach Frank Beamer tried put to rest any doubts about Logan Thomas\u2019s status as Virginia Tech \u2019s starting quarterback on Monday. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cAbsolutely, he\u2019s the quarterback. There\u2019s no question in our mind he\u2019s the guy,\u201d Beamer said emphatically at a news conference at Lane Stadium. \u201cHe\u2019s had a rough outing, but as far as what he\u2019s all about and him being our quarterback, that\u2019s not in question.\u201d Thomas threw for a career-high 391 yards Saturday against Boston College, but two fumbles and two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, were deciding factors in Virginia Tech\u2019s 34-27 loss. It came a week after the redshirt senior threw a career-high four interceptions in an upset loss to Duke at Lane Stadium. The slide has prompted a faction of fans to call for Virginia Tech to give redshirt junior Mark Leal, Thomas\u2019s primary backup the past three seasons, a chance. \n\n Thomas was asked after the Boston College game if he ever considered whether his struggles might land him on the bench at some point. He bristled, quickly responding, \u201cNext question.\u201d On Monday, Thomas, usually reserved with reporters, answered his critics defiantly. \u201cYou can go ahead and ask anybody in this building now, can walk across the street to [the team\u2019s practice facility] and ask anybody over there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can ask anybody that\u2019s a part of this program if they think there\u2019s any chance of me being taken out for a series and it\u2019d be a quick \u2018No.\u2019 \u201cI feel the exact same way, so wherever that question comes from, you can go ahead and throw that out.\u201d Thomas has an ACC-high 12 interceptions through nine games. According to ESPN, his 33 turnovers since the start of last season are tied for the most by a Football Bowl Subdivision player. He had gone three games and 116 consecutive pass attempts without a turnover before the last two games. Wide receiver Josh Stanford remained adamant Monday \u201ca great deal of the interceptions fall on us as receivers.\u201d That, though, hasn\u2019t been enough to satisfy disgruntled fans that have taken to message boards and Twitter to voice their displeasure with a polarizing player that will leave Virginia Tech with most of the school\u2019s records associated with quarterbacks. Beamer was quick to point out that if he listened to all the naysayers, \u201cWe\u2019d be all over the place.\u201d His quarterback agreed. \n\n \u201cPeople are gonna say what they\u2019re gonna say,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIf they want to say something after they come sit in the meeting room with me and come out on the practice field with me, then you can say whatever you want to.

But Coach Tony Bennett started practice in September the same way he always does: with a meticulous tutorial on his trademark \u201cpack line\u201d defense, a variation on a sagging man-to-man. Mitchell has been doing this for four years, \u201cbut you always learn little things.\u201d Among those: His coach has no plans on changing the brand of basketball being played in Charlottesville this season, no matter how high the expectations. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna say it over and over again, the focus is still rely on this pack line right here and keep people from scoring,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe\u2019re still gonna be a defensive team.\u201d But how Bennett balances this roster full of weapons with his own regimented style will be a compelling story line throughout the season, and perhaps will define his tenure at Virginia. Bennett, 44, has enjoyed modest success since arriving on campus before the 2009-10 campaign. He has a 76-53 record and earned one NCAA tournament berth (2011) despite considerable program attrition. Now, though, the Cavaliers return their top five scorers, including first-team all-ACC selection Joe Harris, from a team that barely missed an at-large berth on Selection Sunday. They also add forward Anthony Gill , a transfer from South Carolina, and guard Malcolm Brogdon (medical redshirt in 2012-13) to the mix. And with a rotation that could feature 11 players \u2014 just three of whom are upperclassmen \u2014 Bennett has set the stage for the sort of sustained prosperity Virginia fans have craved. He just wants it to come on his own terms, playing a more modern version of the methodical style his father, former Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett , pioneered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give away the core of what we do,\u201d Bennett said last month. Said Harris: \u201cWe certainly have the ability to put more points on the board, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna change the way we play a whole lot. Defense is always gonna remain constant as long as Coach Bennett is there. That\u2019s a focal point. That\u2019s what we feel is gonna give us the best chance to win games.\u201d Still, Bennett has installed slight offensive adjustments \u2014 he calls it \u201cfine-tuning\u201d \u2014 hopeful his team can create more points through offensive rebounding and more free throws. Last year, the Cavaliers finished within the top 40 nationally in offensive efficiency, but averaged the second-fewest points per game in the ACC. It\u2019s why there is a perception Bennett\u2019s system isn\u2019t conducive to offensive players, an assumption his players say isn\u2019t accurate. \u201cI think we do have the chance to be the best offensive team, probably, the program has seen in my three years because we just have so many options at this point in terms of scoring,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cAnd I think everybody will be able to flourish in this program because Coach Bennett allows guys to play with freedom. If you demonstrate that you can do something well, he lets you do it.\u201d Bennett, though, is known for being honest to a fault, especially during end-of-season meetings in which he explains in great detail a player\u2019s weaknesses and what his role should be on the team. He realizes the blunt approach may be behind why nine players have transferred during his time at Virginia. Nonetheless, he has taken that a step further this season, admitting at the team\u2019s media day to being harsher with his veterans this year, well aware they haven\u2019t accomplished anything just yet despite preseason optimism. In Bennett\u2019s mind, there is a process, and even with better personnel, it hasn\u2019t changed this year. \u201cI think as I do this longer, I become more honest with what I see, and that probably has cost me some recruits .\u2009.\u2009. Right or wrong, I\u2019m not changing on that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can say a lot of things about me, and even the players that have left, \u2018I didn\u2019t fit.\u2019 \u201cBut they can\u2019t say they were misled when they came to this program.

The Miami Dolphins suspended Incognito overnight, and that\u2019s merely a good start. This guy is no mere \u201cbully\u201d; that\u2019s a schoolyard word that doesn\u2019t come close to describing the racist, menacing, strong-arm shakedown of his own teammate, Jonathan Martin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Imagine if you received threatening text messages from a colleague at work, hurling vile racial epithets at you along with a promise to \u201ckill you.\u201d What would you do? First, you would call company security, and then you might call the cops. But because this was the NFL, second-year player Martin thought he had to take it, otherwise he would be called soft. Finally, Martin simply walked away from the Miami Dolphins \u2014 an act that is looking more manly and dignified by the second.  Turns out the real tough guy is Martin, whose decision to rebel against a vicious culture in the Dolphins locker room has triggered a league-level investigation of Incognito, and, if reports are true, needs to extend to other veteran players and management as well. Let\u2019s be clear: This isn\u2019t about the wussifcation of football, or about some light hazing of rookies, short-sheeting their beds or shaving their heads. It\u2019s about an image the league has been trying desperately to change in recent years, and that Incognito personifies: players as conscienceless gangsters who play a game of uncontrolled violence, with sadism and excess as byproducts. The worst part of this story for the NFL is the suggestion that there is a lingering subterranean culture in which thuggery is not just tolerated but rewarded, while restraint is seen as weak. Martin, a second-year starter out of Stanford, was for days characterized by his own management as an oversensitive victim who couldn\u2019t take petty lunchtime bullying and had left the team with an emotional \u201cillness.\u201d But the Dolphins suddenly went into crisis mode Sunday, suspending Incognito around midnight for \u201cconduct detrimental to the team\u201d and asked for a full NFL investigation. That\u2019s because they finally realized what they have on their hands: Couple Incognito\u2019s threatening messages to Martin with complaints from Dolphins rookies to the Miami Herald that they were pressured to pick up tabs of $30,000 for veteran players\u2019 binges at strip clubs, and an ESPN report that Incognito forced Martin to pay $15,000 for a trip to Las Vegas, and this doesn\u2019t look like \u201chazing\u201d anymore. It looks like extortion and intimidation. What\u2019s next, Incognito will feed the snitch into a cement mixer and bury him in a parking lot? This story has sickened people across all boundaries in the league, as well it should. Prediction: Incognito\u2019s case won\u2019t produce the kind of player-commissioner tension we\u2019ve seen over other disciplinary issues. If Roger Goodell wreaks his full powers on Incognito, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone complaining he is too harsh. Incognito deserves due process, but the documentary evidence of his abusive threats to Martin is apparently plain and incontrovertible, and so is his past.   Fellow players annually vote him one of the dirtiest competitors in the league, an eye-gouger who has had issues on virtually every team he ever played for. He was suspended for off-field behavior at Nebraska, and in four years with the St. Louis Rams, he was penalized 38 times, including seven times for unnecessary roughness and was waived in 2009 after earning head-butting penalties and getting in a screaming match with then-coach Steve Spagnuolo. He has been fined and warned by the league that he was courting suspension. Now this. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The NFL is a hard enough profession without guys like Incognito making it harder. The NFL Players Association has worked for years to build solidarity and persuade older players to teach younger ones how to take care of themselves and their money, given the rate at which their health is shattered. Union head DeMaurice Smith has said, \u201cAll players have a responsibility to each other.\u201d The league executive office has done the same under vice president Troy Vincent, who has worked exhaustively on \u201cplayer engagement\u201d programs that preach mentorship and a sense of mutual responsibility.  Incognito\u2019s abuse of a talented young player, a teammate who literally had to stand side by side with him every day, must be equally appalling to both sides, as must be the fact that he was actually a team leader and his attitude appeared to be catching. The saddest part of all? Rookies under the last collective bargaining agreement actually surrendered millions of dollars in income to support older players. Jonathan Martin was already paying Incognito, without a shakedown. Yet no one on the Dolphins roster seems to recognize that. Recently fourth-year Miami player Jared Odrick tweeted a picture of a Henry VIII-sized banquet table loaded with food, and wrote, \u201cEverything tastes better when a rookie pays for it.\u201d In an interview with the Herald, one young Dolphin player anonymously claimed he is literally going broke as a result of the system Dolphin vets called a \u201cvirgin tax,\u201d because he felt unable to say \u201cno\u201d to demands for payment from guys such as Incognito. Incognito and his ilk are not the NFL\u2019s Representative Men \u2014 you hope. In any other profession, someone who threatened and extorted a co-worker would be unemployable. The league is full of good guys and good teammates who play football with exquisite self-control, including the half-dozen players who have signed on to nationwide anti-bullying campaigns. If anyone is representative of the league\u2019s best side, it\u2019s Martin, who had the strength to walk away, even knowing what people might say.

Oh, baby! \n \n\n Depending on your allegiance, you either A) for the first time in this once-crummy season feel like it is indeed now on like Donkey Kong or B) fully understand why there is mandatory drug-testing in the NFL. To be fair to Cofield, I used all the hope-is-alive things he told The Washington Post\u2019s Mark Maske and the Richmond Times-Dispatch\u2019s Paul Woody on Sunday in the sanctuary of a very redemptive FedEx Field locker room, things that pretty much play into every gullible fan\u2019s fantasy that nothing is over \u2014 nothing. \n\n I could have also used Cofield saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say it\u2019s saved,\u201d which, okay, it\u2019s not precisely saying the season is saved. Or, \u201cSo we\u2019ll see,\u201d which is more noncommittal than George Clooney and Derek Jeter. Heck, I could have gone with, \u201cFor now, it\u2019s just a great feeling and we\u2019ve got to carry it on into Minnesota.\u201d But like other facts that get in the way of our opinion, we chose to disregard Cofield\u2019s one-game-at-a-time player-speak \u2014 because we know Coach Mike Shanahan has programmed him to say Thursday night\u2019s nationally broadcast walkover in Minneapolis against the 1-7 Vikings is the biggest game of the season. Also, unlike like laser-focused players and coaches, we media jackals think way ahead. (For example, The Post\u2019s Jason Reid has Washington 12-4 next season.) Anyhow, by inches on Sunday it\u2019s easy for some to assume 3-5 is a blessing rather than a problem. So after the Minnesota win, Philly will be bulldozed the following week at Lincoln Financial Field to get Robert Griffin III and the fellas back to .500. The 49ers are no doubt a rough test on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d after that, but if it can win a real physical scrap, most observers like Washington beating the Giants by at least two touchdowns on Sunday the following week. That puts Shanny\u2019s guys at 7-5, the only team standing between Kansas City and 13-0. You have to think Shanahan will get up for Andy Reid simply for fleecing him on the Donovan McNabb deal. While running the table is very unlikely, conservatively Washington could easily go 10-6 and repeat as division champion. What? They\u2019ve got to lose once more. This is what happens in most cities when homercentrism takes hold after just one godsend gift of a victory, that fork-in-the-road replay that decided Danny Woodhead doesn\u2019t touch the pylon to complete a fourth-quarter collapse. Homercentrism, of course, is judging an opposing team solely by the values and standards of one\u2019s own team. Homercentric fans, hence, only gauge an opponent\u2019s ability to lose to their team in a season\u2019s remaining games. As a parenthetical example, some big dummy of a Post columnist said the Wizards would win 43 games even though they have yet to win one (43 more to go, guys!). Media members and fans who view seasons through homercentric glasses discard the fact that the Vikings retain the rights to Adrian Peterson and can\u2019t be that bad. Or they don\u2019t comprehend that the physically menacing 49ers and the pass rush of the Chiefs frighten current and retired NFL quarterbacks. If you\u2019re actually someone with perspective, if you\u2019re scoring at home in the real world, nothing translates to the next week in the NFL this season \u2014 nothing. While that San Diego win may seem like a major galvanizing force, there are simply no gimmes in the NFL. There are only choices made each week to be good and consistent or unfocused and unworthy of the postseason. Look, fine lines in sports and life are simply glorious to behold. And if that Chargers game qualifies, amen to everyone. Whether that win by his chinny-chin-chin elevates Shanahan to something more rewarding and his team eventually to the postseason can\u2019t be known for at least another few weeks. \n\n Bottom line, it\u2019s probably best to wait on immortalizing the part of Cofield\u2019s quote that mentioned \u201cparade\u201d and focus more on the \u201cso we\u2019ll see\u201d part, however boring and non-committa \n l that might \n seem after Sunday. \n For more by Mike Wise, visit washingtonpost.com/wise .", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Mike Wise", "wordCount": 757}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Football: Flint Hill wins MAC, earns VISAA playoff berth; Perry Street Prep rolles into CAFC final; St. John\u2019s upsets Gonzaga", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/334a9674/sc/35/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Chighschools0Cfootball0Eflint0Ehill0Ewins0Emac0Eearns0Evisaa0Eplayoff0Eberth0Eperry0Estreet0Eprep0Erolles0Einto0Ecafc0Efinal0Est0Ejohns0Eupsets0Egonzaga0C20A130C110C0A40C618a1e960E455d0E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "Early in the season, defending Mid-Atlantic Conference champion Flint Hill\u2019s record didn\u2019t make the Huskies look like a team destined for a 2013 repeat. At 1-3 after four games, Flint Hill looked vulnerable, perhaps not quite as dominating as during their championship year, and that left other MAC teams like last year's runner up the Potomac School (7-2, 3-1) and Sidwell Friends (5-3, 2-2) hoping they could knock the Huskies from the top. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But those three losses had come against the league\u2019s toughest non-conference schedule, a slate of games Flint Hill Coach Tom Verbanic scheduled to challenge his team in preparation for the MAC schedule and, hopefully, the state tournament that would follow if his Huskies got that far.  The plan worked, as the Huskies (6-3, 4-0) cruised through MAC play and Saturday clinched both a second straight MAC title and a berth in the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association Division I playoffs with a 48-15 win over Sidwell Friends. \u201cAny time you can win a championship that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s something our kids worked really hard for,\u201d said Verbanic, whose team won its four MAC games by an average of 29 points each. \u201cEven though we went through a stretch of games where we didn\u2019t play as well as we would\u2019ve hoped, I think it means we hung in there pretty well and just kept getting better.\u201d The Huskies now move on to the semifinals of the VISAA tournament this weekend, when they\u2019ll take on the Collegiate School in Richmond, a team that beat them 30-7 in the regular season. \n Cadets upend Gonzaga \n While some might argue that Sunday\u2019s Washington Catholic Athletic Conference semifinal contest between Gonzaga and St. John\u2019s is the one that matters most, the 4,000-plus fans who gathered at Montgomery Blair last Saturday for the rivals\u2019 83rd regular-season matchup helped ensure that the contest took on a playoff-like feel. With both offenses sputtering, the Cadets ultimately relied on their defense to recover a fumble and make goal-line stand in the second half that sealed a 17-10 win against the Eagles. A day after receiving his Under Armour All-America jersey, Cadets senior and Maryland recruit Will Ulmer sparked his team with a 53-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. Gonzaga\u2019s attempts to respond were hindered by the absence of quarterback Nick Johns and wide receiver Jabari Greenwood , who were both sidelined by injury. It wasn\u2019t until the third quarter that the Eagles put together a long drive, ending in a 1-yard touchdown run by quarterback James Orfini . Gonzaga forced a punt and threatened to take its first lead, but the Eagles muffed the catch and Tyler Strycharz pounced on the ball in the end zone to push St. John\u2019s back ahead, 17-10. The Eagles threatened a late rally when Reggie Corbin broke off a long run up the middle and into Cadet territory. The junior tailback wasn\u2019t so successful a few plays later, as St. John\u2019s defense stuffed Corbin at the 1-yard line on fourth down to snap a three-game losing streak in the series. The two teams will meet again Sunday at 12:30 p.m. at Byrd Stadium with a trip to the WCAC final on the line. \n Panthers reach CAFC title game \n \n\n Perry Street Prep (7-3, 6-2) turned in a statement win against Avalon (5-5, 2-2) in the Capital Area Football Conference semifinals, beating the Black Knights 50-20 in a rematch of a game the Pride lost 34-14 in the regular season. \u201cI was shocked at the 30-point margin of victory,\u201d said Riverdale Baptist Coach Bob Shields, whose Crusaders (10-0, 6-0) will play Perry Street in the CAFC championship this weekend after a 20-0 win over Cesar Chavez (4-6, 2-4) Friday. \u201cWhat that means to me is [Perry Street Coach] Eric Knight, who\u2019s been around this business for 30, 40 years, has that team ready to play at the right time. For them to beat Avalon the way they did.\u2009.\u2009. we\u2019re in for a dogfight.\u201d The Pride racked up 467 yards rushing in the win, 282 of them on just 12 carries by running back Morris Ray , who scored three touchdowns in the win.

The Raiders (6-4) had just taken a 13-3 lead over the Yellow Jackets and were preparing to boot the extra point when an offsides penalty against Osbourn Park moved the ball three feet closer to the goal line. That prompted Raiders Coach Mike Dougherty to green-light the team\u2019s \u201cTimmah\u201d package, which it had installed for just a situation. \u201cEver since freshman or sophomore year, I was always telling coach, \u2018just give me the ball,\u2019\u201d Settle said. The 310-pound, highly-coveted Football Bowl Subdivision recruit set up in the shotgun, flanked by a wing-back in a truly unique expression of the wildcat formation. Settle, who says he excelled as a ball carrier throughout his youth \u2013 especially at quarterback \u2013 saw defenders\u2019 eyes widen as they stacked the box, anticipating a keeper right up the gut. Instead, Settle caught the snap and steered right, taking his only carry through the four-hole between the guard and tackle. \u201c[The defenders] were so confused, they just put everybody up on the line,\u201d Settle said. \u201cI had to lower my shoulder and just kinda push myself through there. I knew I didn\u2019t have that far to go.\u201d As the special teams unit jogged off the field \u2014 15-3 lead in tow \u2013 the expected chuckles and cheers of \u201cBig Timmy\u201d erupted from the Raiders sideline. \u201cThey were laughing,\u201d Settle said. \u201cEven I thought it was funny. But anything to help my team win.\u201d \n\n First-year place kicker carries Forest Park \n\n \n\n Forest Park senior Julian Ayala didn\u2019t show for any of the Bruins\u2019 offseason weightlifting or conditioning sessions. The soccer lifer seldom thought about trying another sport and admits he had a tenuous grasp of football rules before this fall. A week before two-a-days started back in August, Ayala finally caved to his buddy Ebenezer Agyemang \u2019s incessant coaxing to try out for the team\u2019s kick vacancy. \u201cI figured, if I don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll just stop trying out,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cI ended up falling in love with the sport. I liked the hustle, and I liked the intensity of it.\u201d And his skill set was just what the Bruins needed. In Friday\u2019s 20-18 win over Woodbridge, Ayala drilled two field goals, including a 45-yard game winner inside the final minute. Even though Forest Park (7-2) was facing a fourth-and-nine situation, it still took a leap of faith from Coach David Coccoli to call upon Ayala. \u201cThat\u2019s way over his range,\u201d Coccoli said. \u201cIn practice, he\u2019s never made anything over 38 yards. When he makes a 37-yarder, he clears it by 10 yards. It was always like a glass ceiling. Whenever we\u2019d put the ball back any farther, he\u2019d never make it.\u201d Coccoli tried to dole out some 11th-hour encouragement to Ayala before he took the field. Ayala doesn\u2019t remember that. He had tunnel vision. \u201cI was just thinking one thing only, and that was to just make it in,\u201d Ayala said. He made it with five yards to spare.", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Joey LoMonaco", "wordCount": 515}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Redskins Blog: Redskins\u2019 position-by-position review: How the option opens up other plays", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/3349706f/sc/13/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cfootball0Einsider0Cpost0Credskins0Eposition0Eby0Eposition0Ereview0Ehow0Ethe0Eoption0Eopens0Eup0Eother0Eplays0C20A130C110C0A40Ca4d3e5e0A0E456e0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Mark Bullock", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Josh Sweet leads Woodgrove past Broad Run with 48 carries in win", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/33496f2d/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Chighschools0Cjosh0Esweet0Eleads0Ewoodgrove0Epast0Ebroad0Erun0Ewith0E480Ecarries0Ein0Ewin0C20A130C110C0A40C1eb35d8c0E45650E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "Late in the fourth quarter Friday night, Woodgrove running back Josh Sweet\u2019s helmet popped off after a four-yard run. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rules required Sweet to sit out the next play, but that would be the only one he missed. \n\n The Cornell recruit \n carried the ball a career-high 48 times in Woodgrove\u2019s 24-23 win over Broad Run \n. His 274 yards were 23 short of a career-best. \n \u201cI just wanted to win,\u201d Sweet said with a laugh in a Sunday phone interview. \u201cI had no idea I ran for that many yards. I just wanted to get the victory on senior night. It was huge.\u201d The Wolverines (6-3, 4-1 Dulles District) controlled the time of possession with their downhill running game. They were on offense for 38 minutes compared to just 10 minutes for Broad Run (6-3, 2-1 Potomac District). After beating a tough Broad Run team it hadn\u2019t faced in its four years of existence, Woodgrove is likely to move up the 4A North playoff rankings. They sat ninth entering the weekend. This season will produce a second consecutive playoff berth for the Wolverines, who are far removed from their inaugural 2-8 season in 2010. Much of that credit goes to Sweet and the other 16 seniors that represent the school\u2019s first four-year graduating class. The one-point victory against Broad Run proved to the Wolverines that they could excel in close games. Their smallest margin of victory in their five previous wins was 28 points. Woodgrove could have another tough game coming up this week when it faces cross-town rival Loudoun Valley (8-1, 5-0 Dulles) in the regular season finale Friday. The schools are separated by less than four miles. \u201cThere\u2019s no motivation needed for Valley week,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited. This is a big rivalry in Loudoun [County]. We\u2019re ready for the challenge. We both have great teams this year.\u201d \n Stone Bridge finds a way against Fairfax \n When No. 14 Stone Bridge has a 17-point lead on a Liberty District opponent, it usually feels like the result is a done deal. The Bulldogs (7-2, 6-0 Liberty District) hadn\u2019t trailed in a district game all season, but they ran into Nick Scott and Fairfax (6-3, 4-2) on Friday. Scott threw for 226 passing yards and rushed for 138 yards to account for four touchdowns as Fairfax rallied to take a 28-27 lead late in the fourth quarter. But Stone Bridge answered with 57 seconds left on a four-yard touchdown run by Collin Buckley to escape with a 33-28 win.

And by the time Trevor Ariza eventually got fed up and collected a flagrant foul for tossing backup Heat center Chris Andersen to the ground, the Wizards had already been overrun by LeBron James \u2019s skillful display of passing and three-pointers and Dwyane Wade \u2019s arsenal of floaters and dunks.  After Andersen made his free throws, the Wizards trailed by 23 points and were well on their way to a 103-93 loss and third consecutive 0-3 start. But they managed to rally and forced Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra to reinsert James and Chris Bosh for the finish with a fourth quarter that left Wittman more encouraged by his team. \u201cThis was a game I thought they hit us and we took the punch. We kept fighting the whole way through,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cThis is how we need to play, learning and moving forward. Nobody wants to lose, but we took some steps in the right direction.\u201d \n\n Bradley Beal snapped out of his early doldrums to lead the Wizards with 19 points and matched his total from the first two games with four three-pointers. John Wall recovered from back spasms that flared up in the previous loss to Philadelphia and finished with 11 points and nine assists, and Ariza and Martell Webster \n had 13 points each. Trevor Booker jammed his left index finger in the third quarter after scoring eight points with six rebounds but didn\u2019t return. Afterward, Booker said his finger was \u201cfine.\u201d But the Wizards were once again without Nene, who missed his second straight game with a strained left calf. Nene said he planned to have an MRI exam on Monday when the Wizards return to Washington. The Wizards continued to struggle without him, dropping to 7-30 in games that he\u2019s missed since arriving in trade deadline deal with Denver in March 2012. Marcin Gortat got his second start with the Wizards and posted 15 points and 11 rebounds, his first double-double of the season. Gortat also nailed his third career three-pointer \u2014 and first in three seasons \u2014 to bring the Wizards within 61-48 at halftime. \u201cWe never got down on ourselves about the score,\u201d Webster said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing about this game. There\u2019s opportunities and teams will give you a chance to get back into the game. It was a little too late.\u201d Wittman told his team at halftime that the Heat (2-2) has been complacent in the early part of the season, losing both to Philadelphia and Brooklyn after leading by double digits. The Heat didn\u2019t have that problem in the third quarter, when it took advantage of a series of Wizards miscues and missed shots and closed out the period on an 18-7 run. \n The Wizards had 21 turnovers, which the Heat turned into 25 points. \u201cIt hurt us,\u201d Wittman said of the turnovers. \u201cTwenty-one turnovers is far too many. They are one of the best, turning turnovers into points. But we kept battling and making plays. Our energy level for 48 minutes was really good.\u201d Ariza picked up three fouls in the first half and also missed his first eight field goals before scoring 11 points in the fourth quarter, when the Wizards eventually got within seven. He was clearly fueled by his act of frustration late in the third quarter. While trying to close out on Heat forward Shane Battier in the left corner, Ariza got blocked off by Andersen, who appeared to be making a moving screen. Ariza shoved Andersen and accepted his flagrant foul with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll say, they\u2019re already a good team. They don\u2019t need no help,\u201d said Ariza. \u201cWe just stayed in the game. Kept playing. That\u2019s about it.\u201d The Wizards may have caught the Heat at the wrong time, since it had stumbled to a 1-2 start. Wade compared the Heat\u2019s early problems to a relationship in which one partner gets neglectful and stops doing all the little things. Miami was certainly more alert when it came to sharing the ball, as it had 32 assists on 37 made baskets. James led all scorers with 25 points, Bosh had 24 and Wade chipped in with 20. Washington probably had a hint that the night wouldn\u2019t go their way in the first half, when Wall drove into the lane and James clobbered him as Wall found Beal wide open in the corner. Flat on his belly, Wall watched as Beal buried a three-pointer that would\u2019ve brought the Wizards within nine points \u2014 but James was whistled for a foul, waving off the points. The Wizards\u2019 possession ended with Wall being forced to take a shot from 25 feet as the shot clock expired. \u201cI was surprised they called the foul. I made the pass, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t shoot it and I look, it\u2019s going in and they call the foul late, so that\u2019s how it goes,\u201d said Wall, who was still pleased with the team\u2019s ability to stay with it. \u201cYou never want to say a loss is good, but this one is, because we improved.\u201d", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Michael Lee", "wordCount": 890}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Sluggish Baltimore Ravens lose, 24-18, to the Browns in Cleveland", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/3348ffcd/sc/13/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0C20A130C110C0A30C63db7c40A0E44df0E11e30Ebf0Ac0Ecebf37c6f4840Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "CLEVELAND \u2014 With every unproductive run, ill-advised penalty and blown assignment, the Baltimore Ravens hammered home the point Cleveland Browns cornerback Joe Haden made during the week. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t These Ravens are not the Ravens of old. Those teams got better as the season went on, made key plays late in games and played their best football after the bye week. They also always beat the Browns. These Ravens proved incapable of accomplishing any of those things Sunday, and as a result, their sagging playoff hopes took another hit. A 24-18 loss to Cleveland before an announced 71,513 at First Energy Stadium featured all of the same elements that pop up every week and have been the difference in the Ravens (3-5) losing close games. On offense, the running game and pass protection was nonexistent. On defense, communication errors hurt the Ravens early, and a failure to get off the field late ended the team\u2019s comeback hopes. A muffed punt by returner Tandon Doss led to a Browns touchdown and completed the breakdown of all three phases. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t been good enough,\u201d said battered Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who hit rookie Marlon Brown for two touchdowns as part of an uneven day. Flacco\u2019s status as the team\u2019s leading rusher summed up the afternoon almost as well as his fluttering second-quarter interception in which he badly underthrew Jacoby Jones. \u201cThey were better than us,\u201d Flacco said. With their third quarterback of the season, Jason Campbell, encountering little resistance at times driving his team down the field, the Browns built a 14-3 lead early in the second quarter thanks to two Davone Bess touchdown catches. Cleveland took a 21-10 lead into the fourth quarter, and it held off the reigning Super Bowl champions from there, draining all but 14 seconds off the clock in its final drive before former Ravens place kicker Billy Cundiff made a 22-yard field goal to give the home team a 24-18 lead. The victory represented the Browns\u2019 first over a team coached by John Harbaugh and quarterbacked by Flacco. It was the Browns\u2019 first win over the Ravens since Nov. 18, 2007. But beyond that, it was the Ravens\u2019 third straight loss and their fourth in five games. \u201cWe have to win a game,\u201d Ravens defensive end Chris Canty said. \u201cThat\u2019s as simple as I can put it. We\u2019re in a situation where we have to win a game. That\u2019s our focus.\u201d The Ravens fell into third place in the AFC North behind the Browns (4-5). Baltimore hosts the first-place Cincinnati Bengals (6-3) on Sunday. The Ravens, who entered the week ranked 28th in rushing yards per game, gained just 55 on 21 carries. Ray Rice had just 17 on 11 carries. \u201cWe got to figure that out,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cWe cannot run the ball right now.\u201d Flacco was battered for much of the game, sacked five times and hit eight total times as the offense again wasn\u2019t able to get anything going until late in the second quarter when Brown caught a 19-yard touchdown to cut Cleveland\u2019s lead to 14-10 heading into halftime. Things went from bad to worse for the visitors about midway through the third quarter when Doss muffed a punt, giving the Browns the ball at the 11-yard line. Two plays later, Campbell hit reserve tight end Gary Barnidge for a four-yard touchdown and a 21-10 Cleveland lead. \u201cWe\u2019re 3-5,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThe math says it\u2019s going to be a challenge. We\u2019re going to have to win some games. We\u2019re going to have to start winning close games. That\u2019s the No. 1 thing we\u2019ve got to get done, and you do that first of all by not losing the game. You can\u2019t make the mistakes that create opportunities for your opponent, and we\u2019ve done way too much of that.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Baltimore Sun", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Jeff Zrebiec", "wordCount": 622}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Redskins vs. Chargers: Darrel Young helps spark resurgent running game", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/3348ffb9/sc/13/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Credskins0Credskins0Evs0Echargers0Edarrel0Eyoung0Ehelps0Espark0Eresurgent0Erunning0Egame0C20A130C110C0A30C349c7c120E43c80E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Isports/story01.htm", "text": "The moment after Darrel Young came crashing down into the end-zone turf, sending the Washington Redskins to an emotional 30-24 overtime victory against San Diego on Sunday at FedEx Field, he hurriedly got up and made the short run toward the stands. With the frenzied fans bracing for a leap and his teammates jubilantly chasing him, it was anybody\u2019s guess as to what the 248-pound fullback would do to celebrate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But even though it had been nearly two years since Young last ran for a score and even longer since he had put together a three-touchdown performance like Sunday\u2019s, the fourth-year pro simply handed the ball to a fan and turned his back toward the sideline as if he\u2019d done it all before. Bobby Turner, the Redskins\u2019 running backs coach, \u201cdoesn\u2019t like that,\u201d Young said. \u201cRemember that he\u2019s old school, man. [He wants you] to just give the ball to a fan and walk back to the sideline. I\u2019m good. I want to keep my job.\u201d Young saw his duties expand Sunday, carrying the ball a career-high five times for 12 yards and scoring three times on third-and-one situations. Alfred Morris found relatively similar success on the ground, recording season highs of 25 carries on 121 yards.\n On Washington\u2019s game-winning drive, the Redskins handed the ball to Morris six times before calling on Young to rush four yards for the decisive touchdown. The play-calling marked a stark contrast from last week\u2019s 45-21 loss in Denver , when Morris tallied just five carries after the Redskins had built a 21-7 third-quarter lead\n. The Redskins are 10-1 when Morris records 20 or more rushing attempts. \u201cThird downs have been a problem for us. When we started going to that run last year, third down was actually on our side,\u201d Young said. \u201cAnd for them to give me the ball on third down, that\u2019s a lot of trust and I appreciate the coaches just allowing me to be in that situation.\u201d Young said that the push to incorporate him into the offense more has been weeks in the making. The plan culminated Sunday with Coach Mike Shanahan telling Young that on the team\u2019s first trip to the red zone, he would call his fullback\u2019s number. That moment came at the end of the third quarter with the Redskins on the San Diego 8-yard line. After running off tackle to the left for three yards, Washington went back to Young two plays later for a one-yard push into the end zone. Though Washington\u2019s 40 rushing attempts were well above its season average of nearly 28 per game, the Chargers entered Sunday\u2019s game knowing that they could see a heavy dose of the running game. \u201cWith the Redskins, you\u2019ve got to be prepared for everything,\u201d Chargers defensive lineman Sean Lissemore said. \u201cThey\u2019re just a multidimensional offense. They can do everything.\u201d What Washington hadn\u2019t been able to do consistently prior to Sunday\u2019s contest was convert on third downs. Behind Young\u2019s three third-down touchdowns, however, the Redskins found success on 12 of their 17 third-down attempts, their highest conversion rate since a 2005 win against Seattle. Whether that means more carries for Young in the future is unclear, but he is prepared to contribute in any way he can. \u201cIt\u2019s just giving [defenses] something else to think about and doing something that we\u2019re good at,\u201d Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III said about the message their ground success sends to opponents. \u201cWe trust [Young] with the ball. He\u2019s always had a pretty good rushing average for us. Three touchdowns, it\u2019s probably one yard per carry, but hey, he doesn\u2019t really care about that as long as he\u2019s helping us win.\u201d", "topics": ["sports"], "author": "Brandon Parker", "wordCount": 602}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Senate Advances Employment Non-Discrimination Act", "url": "http://www.npr.org/2013/11/05/243155146/senate-advances-employment-non-discrimination-act?ft=1&f=1014", "text": "With a vote of 61-30, the Senate voted to move forward on legislation that would prohibit workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Mike Michaud talks to an Associated Press reporter Monday in Portland, Maine, about his public announcement that he is gay.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n The final chapter in the history of bombshells of the closeted-gay-politician variety may have been written Monday by Rep. Mike Michaud, a Maine Democrat running for governor.  Michaud, 58, announced in a column published in two state newspapers and by the Associated Press that he is a gay man, and followed it with the question: \"But why should it matter?\"  Judging from immediate reaction in Maine, where Michaud next year will be competing to become the first governor in U.S. history elected as an openly gay man, the answer seemed to be that it probably won't.  \"I don't think this will be a defining issue,\" says MaryEllen FitzGerald, president of the Portland, Maine-based Critical Insights market research and polling firm. \"And I don't think most people are surprised by his announcement.\"  Wrote the Bangor Daily News in an editorial headline: \"Mike Michaud is gay. Welcome this truth and move on.\"  Those on the ground in Maine are predicting that the expected three-way race in 2014 between Michaud, Republican Gov. Paul LePage, and progressive Independent Eliot Cutler remains competitive \u2014 and largely unchanged \u2014 after Monday's not-so-big reveal.  More Help Than Hurt?  One effect, however, could come in the money race. Michaud, the seventh openly gay or bisexual member (all Democrats) currently serving in the House, now becomes a symbol for LGBT supporters nationwide, says Mike Tipping of the Maine People's Resource Center, a non-profit that conducts regular polling and public opinion research.  The congressman's announcement, he says, will likely increase his ability to raise money nationally, and potentially help him siphon some support from Cutler.  \"This is more likely to help him electorally than hurt him,\" Tipping says. \"LePage has locked up conservative support, but there's more fluidity among moderate and progressive voters, going between Michaud and Cutler.\"  \"If anything, this will help him among that voting bloc,\" he says.  Michaud's announcement comes a day before LePage, 65, a Tea Party favorite with high statewide negative ratings, has plans to announce that he'll seek a second term. Cutler, 67, a wealthy environmental lawyer who finished second to LePage in a three-way race in 2010, announced in September that he would run again.  Poll averages show Michaud, a Franco-American Catholic who has held elective office since 1980, leading in both a three-way matchup and in a two-candidate race with LePage.  State of Play  Maine voters last year legalized same-sex marriage, by a vote of 53-47 percent, three years after they had rejected a similar effort. Michaud and Cutler supported the legalization effort; LePage has said that he personally opposes gay marriage, but that it should be up to voters to decide.  Though there remains significant polarization over gay marriage, the antipathy does not appear to extend to candidates' sexual orientation, says FitzGerald, of the Portland market research firm.  \"Mainers have shown tolerance on this and intolerance toward those trying the make that type of thing an issue,\" she said. \"This candidate has a long track record in public service that people can judge him on.\"  Writing in the Portland Press Herald, political reporter Steve Mistler noted that \"rumors about Michaud's sexual orientation have followed the former mill worker throughout his 33-year political career, but have never been reported.\"  Michaud served two terms in the state House, and five in the state Senate. He came to Washington in 2003 after what would prove to be his only close race for Congress \u2014 a 52 to 48 percent victory over Republican Kevin Raye.  He has since easily won re-election in the more rural and conservative of the state's two congressional districts.  \"He worked in a mill, drove a forklift, he doesn't have a college degree, and has among the least personal wealth of anyone in Congress,\" Tipping says. \"There are some other identity politics in this race.\"  In his coming-out column, Michaud suggested that his hand was forced by opponents' \"whisper campaigns, insinuations, and push-polls.\"  The notion that he was somehow outed, however, struck FitzGerald as a bit funny.  \"This is Maine, where nobody is whispering,\" she said. \"This is just one large small town.\"  A town in which Michaud's announcement, whatever prompted it, came as little surprise and, a year from now, may have a marginal effect on what's expected to be a hotly contested election.", "topics": [], "author": "Liz Halloran", "wordCount": 758}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Employment Non-Discrimination Act Passes First Senate Hurdle", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/11/04/243023548/senate-poised-to-pass-employment-non-discrimination-act?ft=1&f=1014", "text": "Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Sen.

Heller announced his support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act on Monday.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n The Senate is expected to vote Monday evening for cloture on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), a bill that would forbid employers with at least 15 employees from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.  The measure, which has been around in various forms for decades, has more Senate support than ever before \u2014 but likely not enough in the GOP-controlled House to become law.  Politico reported Monday that House Speaker John Boehner opposes the legislation, and believes it would cost jobs and lead to frivolous lawsuits.  So far, every Democratic senator and both independents have said they will vote for the bill this year. And there are two Republican co-sponsors, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.  Still, at least five Senate Republicans will have to support ENDA to defeat a filibuster.  Two Republicans \u2014 Orrin Hatch of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 are also expected to support ENDA, although neither has officially stated they will. Both voted for the Senate bill in its current form this summer, when it passed the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this summer.  On Monday, Republican Dean Heller of Nevada added his support for the bill. \"After listening to Nevadans' concerns about this issue from a variety of viewpoints and after numerous conversations with my colleagues, I feel that supporting this legislation is the right thing to do,\" Heller said in a statement.  That puts the tentative vote count at 60, just enough to defeat a filibuster. The bill's advocates hope even more Republicans will throw their support behind the legislation, which they believe would send a strong message of bipartisan support for LGBT protections.  Fred Sainz, the vice president of communications and marketing at the Human Rights Campaign, said the organization has focused its efforts on getting support from Heller, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio.  \"We are cautiously optimistic that we'll be there [on Monday], but we're not taking anything for granted,\" said Sainz. \"Nothing is sure until the vote takes place.\"  Sainz said organizers in seven states have held 150 events to garner grassroots support for ENDA. So far, these events have generated over 200,000 constituent contacts to these prospective senators in support of the bill. Supporters of the legislation have been targeting Portman, in particular, who came out in support of same-sex marriage earlier this year.  Caitlin Dunn, Portman's press secretary, said in an email that the Senator \"agrees with the underlying principle of ENDA and supports ending unjust discrimination based on one's sexual orientation. He doesn't think one of his constituents should be able to be fired just because he or she is gay. The bill as it stands, however, is not perfect, and he continues to discuss his concerns with the bill's sponsors and is exploring ways to strengthen the bill, including its religious liberties provisions.\"  The last time ENDA faced a vote in the Senate was in 1996, when Republicans held the majority. It failed with a final vote of 49-50.  Currently, 29 states have no legislation banning employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and 33 states are without gender identity employment protections.  Federal employment protections that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, and genetic information are already in place.

Charlie Crist announces that he will run for governor as a Democrat on Monday at Albert Whitted Park in St. Petersburg.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Florida's governor's race just got more interesting. The state's former Republican governor, Charlie Crist, announced in St. Petersburg on Monday that he's entering the race as a Democrat.  Crist is running against Florida's current Republican governor, Rick Scott, a conservative elected with strong Tea Party support.  At a rally to kick off his campaign at a park overlooking Tampa Bay, Crist was unapologetic about his change in parties.  \"Yeah, I'm running as a Democrat,\" he said. \"And I am proud to do it.\"  There have been a lot of changes for Crist over the last three years. In his first term as governor, he decided to run for Florida's open Senate seat.  But that was just after \"the hug\" \u2014 when Crist welcomed President Obama to Florida with a half-embrace. It became a symbol for conservative Republicans of what they didn't like about Crist. Even more, it helped Marco Rubio galvanize Tea Party support and win the Republican nomination for the Senate.  Crist left the Republican Party to run \u2014 and lose \u2014 as an independent.  Now he's back looking for his old job as governor \u2014 this time, as a Democrat. He says he's entered the race because he doesn't like what he sees from Scott, his conservative Republican successor.  \"The more I watched Rick Scott govern,\" Crist said, \"the partisanship, the deals, always putting the special interests ahead of your interests, and the more I heard from you the people, I knew it was time to take Florida in a better direction.\"  Scott is a former hospital executive who narrowly won as governor in 2010 by spending more than $70 million of his personal fortune. As governor, he has opposed many of Obama's policies, rejecting billions of dollars in stimulus money to build a high-speed rail line and helping lead the fight against the Affordable Care Act.  This week, Scott is on an overseas trade mission. Although he hasn't officially kicked off his re-election campaign yet, it's already active, producing an ad running this week attacking Crist with quotes from his former Democratic adversaries.  Although he just made it official, Crist's entrance into the governor's race has been long anticipated. Florida Republicans began sending out releases attacking him over the summer. During Monday's rally, a plane flew overhead towing a banner with the address of a Republican website attacking him.  Democrats say those are signs that Republicans are worried. Florida Republican Chairman Lenny Curry denies that.  \"It's clear to us that the Democrats don't have much of a bench in the state of Florida,\" he said. \"And Charlie was jabbing and poking enough that would lead one to believe that he was going to seek some office. So we figured we'd go on offense.\"  Among party leaders and the Republican base in Florida, Crist is considered a turncoat, someone who betrayed conservative principles and his party for personal ambition.  But among moderate Republicans, independents and now Democrats, Crist thinks he'll do well. Democratic leaders embraced him at a recent statewide convention \u2014 despite the fact that a long-time Democratic stalwart, former state Sen. Nan Rich, is already in the race.  Long before he switched parties, Crist embraced policies as governor that endeared him to Democrats and angered some Republicans. He pushed to restore voting rights to felons who served their time, and in the 2008 presidential election, extended early voting hours, a move that helped Obama win Florida.  Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who managed the Obama campaign in Florida, says that, at the time, Crist's decision was \"shocking.\"  \"It was, I think, a fairly courageous decision, all in all,\" Schale says. \"In the end, I don't know that the decision itself is why we won Florida. But it certainly made it possible for more people to get out and vote.\"  On his transition from Republican to Democrat, Crist echoes Ronald Reagan, turning around his famous quote with \"I didn't leave the Republican Party. It left me.\"  At his campaign rally in St. Petersburg, Crist attacked Scott as a tool of the Tea Party and special interests, linking him with the no-compromise stance that he said led to the deadlock in Washington.  A governor's duty, Crist said, is to represent all of the people. \"It is not a sin,\" he said, \"to reach across the aisle. It is your obligation to work together.\"  The Florida governor's race is expected to draw a lot of attention and money from outside of the state. The Scott campaign has said it may spend $100 million and Democrats will seek to match it.", "topics": [], "author": "Greg Allen", "wordCount": 811}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Coloradans To Vote On Schools Initiative Mixing Funding, Reforms", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=243056289&ft=1&f=1014", "text": "Colorado voters have a big decision to make next week on a proposal that would overhaul the state's public education system.

There is a lot of buzz there around the charismatic 31-year-old.  The city of about 100,000 people just south of Los Angeles has long struggled with gangs and street violence. But it wasn't always that way. Compton flourished in the '50s and '60s, when its factory jobs were a beacon for African-Americans fleeing the South.  That's the Compton Aja Brown heard about from her family when she was growing up. Now, her grand plan to turn the city around is turning a lot of heads inside and outside of City Hall.  From Rap To Radishes  Most people around the world have heard of Compton in rap lyrics, embedded in drum beats and lines like: \"I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors be cautious, one phone call will have your body dumped.\"  \n    \n     Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       A mural in downtown Compton, Calif., puts Cesar Chavez and Martin Luther King Jr., side by side. The historically black city is predominantly Hispanic. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       A mural in downtown Compton, Calif., puts Cesar Chavez and Martin Luther King Jr., side by side. The historically black city is predominantly Hispanic.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Rappers put this city on the map in the '80s and '90s. According to Brown, the reputation is still dragging the city down today.  \"I think that as long as people can recognize Eazy-E and Dr. Dre, we have to work twice as hard to put a new image in front of the world,\" says Brown, who residents voted in handily in July.  Brown says if that image gets fixed, then other, tangible changes will follow. Her rebranding of Compton is already underway here, on this newly redeveloped stretch of Willowbrook Ave.  Walking around Compton's new weekly farmers market, the mayor has shed her signature pumps for flats. Getting the market going was one of the first things she did when she took office. There hasn't been a farmers market in Compton for 25 years.  Brown grew up in nearby Pasadena, but has family roots in Compton. She has two degrees in urban planning from the University of Southern California and isn't lacking in confidence. And there are some early successes beyond just the farmers market to back that up.  Early Successes  Brown has already cut Compton's deep budget deficit nearly in half. She's started a gang intervention and community policing program, an effort to smooth out decades of mistrust between this community and the L.A. County Sheriff's deputies who patrol it. She's also using tax incentives to lure more businesses \u2014 and young professionals like her \u2014 back to the city.  It's all an ambitious agenda that Brown says rests on image and community empowerment. In other cities, she says, citizens have a different relationship with their surroundings.  \"In other communities, people don't throw their trash on the ground. If they see graffiti, they report it,\" she says. \"And so, it really is going to be a change at the citizen's level.\"  It's a little too early to draw comparisons between Brown and fast-rising black politicians like Cory Booker or even Barack Obama in his early days. But there's a wide sense here, in this city plagued by years of corruption at City Hall, that she is going places.  One afternoon, at a new \"Coffee with the Mayor\" event at a local Starbucks, the buzz around Brown in the room is electric. People practically trip over each other to meet her and snap photos with her. Sarah Pendiman, a retired teacher, and her friend Jackie McGee, a retired nurse, stand at the back of the cafe, beaming.  \"I've lived here over 40 years, so it's time for a change,\" says Pendiman. \"And she's a good change.\"  \"We have the capability of being a great city, and we were once,\" McGee adds. \n \n\n  A Lot Of Problems Linger  Make no mistake, there are still a lot of problems here. Unemployment is stubbornly high. A recent weekend brought a slate of deadly drive-by shootings. It was a grim reminder that Brown's new gang and youth development initiatives have their work ahead of them. And earlier this year, the perennial racial tensions between blacks and Latinos were again thrust into the spotlight with two hate crimes .  Lifelong Compton resident Julius Franklin describes himself as half-black and half-Latino, and was among hundreds to attend a unity rally in the days after those hate crimes. He says the new mayor is someone who can unite both sides.  \"Sometimes it gets portrayed as something more serious than what it is. And a lot of those events are just isolated events,\" says Franklin. He says personal feuds are easily magnified into \"an African-American against Latino thing.\"  Brown says her support base spans both sides.  \"The Latino community and African American community are very supportive,\" she says. \"And we all want the same things.\"  She bristles a little at the topic of racial tension here, saying a lot of the violence can be attributed to \"people outside the community.\"  \"And you can't stop that, but you definitely can keep cohesion within the city,\" she says.  Brown says emphatically that City Hall has to start looking more like the city itself. She points out that in this past summer's election, voters also elected Compton's first Latino council member.  In front of City Hall, where she's standing, there's a huge mural of President Obama. It's hard not to draw at least one comparison \u2014 that like him, in these early days in office, people are pinning a lot of hope on her.", "topics": [], "author": "Kirk Siegler", "wordCount": 963}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Cutting SNAP Benefits Not A Snap Decision", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=242990492&ft=1&f=1014", "text": "The holidays are coming up, and that often means decadent family feasts.

This week, the political headlines are expected to be dominated by several important off-year elections whose outcomes seem a foregone conclusion, if you believe the polls.  Democrat Terry McAulliffe in Virginia and Republican Chris Christie in New Jersey have significant polling leads in their governor's races. In New York City, Democrat and mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio's appears poised to win in a blowout.  But that's tomorrow's news. On Monday, a critical procedural vote is scheduled in the Senate on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which would give lesbian, gay, bisesexual and transgender workers similar federal protections against workplace discrimination like those protecting most other workers.  And that's a good place to start with a quick look at some of the more interesting pieces of political news or analysis that caught my eye this morning.  The Senate is thought to be one vote away from the 60 needed to advance the ENDA legislation to a final vote. One of several Republican senators is expected to provide the needed vote on a divisive issue for the GOP , the New York Times' Jeremy Peters reported . The bill's prospects in the GOP-controlled House are less certain.  And in an op-ed that couldn't have been timed better for the ENDA debate, Maine congressman Michael Michaud, a Democrat running for governor, confirms that he's gay in an op-ed in the Bangor Daily News. To the question, is he gay? he answers: \"Yes, I am. But why should it matter?\"  President Obama's aides have had to remake his schedule for the next few months because of the problems with the Affordable Care Act website. The president won't be spending nearly as much time at events urging people to enroll under Obamacare since the website is under repair. Instead, he will do more immigration and economic events, report Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas of the Wall Street Journal.  Mitt Romney made news over the weekend by accusing President Obama of \"fundamental dishonesty\" in his sales pitches for the Affordable Care Act. Appearing on NBC New's Meet the Press, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee said Obama \"has undermined the foundation of his second term. I think it is rotting away.\"  Obamacare giveth. Under the ACA, millions of low-income people will be eligible for health plans that will cost them nothing because of the government-provided subsidies, report the New York Times' Reed Abelson and Katie Thomas.  Obamacare taketh away. The growing political threat to Democrats can be measured in the anecdotes that keep rolling in of people who have to buy more expensive insurance coverage because their older policies aren't being renewed under the law, report the Washington Posts Ariana Euchung Cha and Lena Sun.  Obama's tech buddy, Google chairman Eric Schmidt, slammed the NSA over allegations that the spy agency monitored traffic between the data centers of several Internet giants. He told the Wall Street Journal's Deborah Kan the NSA practices, if true, were \"outrageous.\"  Former House Speaker Jim Wright, 90, was rebuffed on his first attempt to get a voter ID card in Texas, report the Ft. Worth Star Telegram's Terry Evans and Anna M. Tinsley. \"Nobody was ugly to us but they insisted that they wouldn't give me an ID,\" he was quoted as saying.

She and about 40 of her colleagues are staffing the phones for Maximus , the company Connecticut has contracted to run its call center.  The government contractors running the troubled HealthCare.gov website have been under intense scrutiny in the past month, but those businesses aren't the only ones being paid to rollout Obamacare.  In the states that are running their own health care exchanges, practices vary. Oregon, for instance, set up its own call centers; other states, like Connecticut, farm that business out to companies like Maximus.  \"It's a huge opportunity, and it remains so,\" says Rick Howard , an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. \"There are millions of millions of folks coming in for insurance coverage. That represents a great opportunity for both commercial carriers and for those contractors who are servicing health care.\"  How much is Maximus making in Connecticut? In a press release , the company valued the contract at $15 million over three years, for staffing and operating the call center. But that lump sum is all the information the company provides.  Access Health CT, the state's exchange , wouldn't confirm the $15 million price tag. And while it will say that it is paying a per minute fee per call, it won't say how that fee is calculated. In fact, its contract with Maximus that it makes available to the public blacks out all language that has to do with pricing.  That means that taxpayers can't know how much the state of Connecticut is paying Maximus.  Why?  Well, redactions are things that typically relate to privacy and competitive issues from vendors,\" says Kevin Counihan , CEO of Access Health CT, the state's new insurance marketplace. Counihan says state law allows vendors like Maximus to redact what they think is proprietary information from public documents.  But should pricing be propriety in a government contract?  \"Is price something that someone should be able to redact? I sure think so. What's the whole point? If everybody knows what everybody is pricing, everybody's going to be pricing at the same level. And that doesn't drive a good deal,\" Counihan says .  Maximus refused to comment on its Connecticut pricing. In a statement, the company says call centers are in a \"highly competitive industry.\"  But in emails to the state, the company justifies its position by saying that releasing its pricing information would \"result in irreparable economic damage to Maximus and significantly weaken its competitive position in the marketplace.\"  Maximus also has a contract in Hawaii. But in that state it doesn't have to disclose its contracts at all because its entire health insurance marketplace, the Hawaii Health Connector, is exempt from the state's sunshine laws.  Vermont's exchange handled things differently. It has posted on the internet a complete, unredacted copy of its contract with Maximus. The document spells out everything from how long a call can be on hold to how quickly it must be answered.  Mark Larson, the head of Vermont's exchange, explains: \"We are spending taxpayer dollars and we understand our responsibility to ensure that there's transparency in how those dollars are being spent, to whom they're being given, and what we get in return for them. And we want to make sure that it's easy for Vermonters or others to find that information.\"  According to the contract, Vermont pays Maximus 86 cents a minute for calls, and the state estimates a call volume of about 573,300 minutes per month. That comes out to about $500,000 a month.  Rick Howard, the Gartner analyst, says that, in an ideal world, none of the call center prices would matter. Everyone would sign up on the Internet.  \"This is just a really complicated, initially, enrollment cycle,\" Howard says. \"Once the websites continue to evolve, then I would expect, over time, call center activities to be greatly reduced from what they were here in the first months or year of the marketplace.\"  Until that happens, there's money to be made. But in Connecticut, the public just can't know how much.

And the discussion has grown more serious as details have emerged.  \"Today, the revelation of these texts and more details about what actually happened changes this [from] a discussion of if a large person can be bullied, to where we are now, which is real harassment, possibly criminal,\" Mike says.  \"The broader issue is hazing in the NFL,\" Mike says. \"Hazing goes on in the NFL much more so than it does in a lot of other institutions.\"  Mike says that the NFL is a private enterprise where hazing is often seen as harmless \u2014 but it generally means \"rookies have to carry equipment; sometimes rookies are made to pay very large bills when the veterans go out to eat,\" he says.  The Miami Herald reports that if Martin was the target of hazing, he wasn't alone.  \"Incognito pressured Martin into paying $15,000 for an unofficial team vacation to Las Vegas \u2013 a trip that Martin didn't even join,\" the newspaper says. \"One young defensive player, whose privacy the Miami Herald is protecting, is on his way to going broke because he has been unable to say no to the older players, a source said.\"  As for what punishment the NFL might dole out if the current allegations are proven, Mike says, \"The commissioner, Roger Goodell, has leveled heavy fines and heavy suspensions for things that embarrass the league. It's not hard to think that Roger Goodell will act up on this very fiercely.\"  On Sunday afternoon, the Dolphins said in a statement, \"We received notification today from Jonathan's representation about allegations of player misconduct. We are taking these allegations very seriously and plan to review the matter further.\"  The team said it had contacted the NFL about the allegations.  That message contrasted with the tone of a Dolphins statement issued earlier on Sunday in which the team said, \"The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally.\"", "topics": [], "author": "Bill Chappell", "wordCount": 800}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Biden, A Man Of Many Words, Omits One At Va.

Nor any mention of health care, aside from a reference to Cuccinelli's participation, as Virginia attorney general, in conservative efforts to restrict women's health care (read abortion rights) in the state. It was noticed .  Biden's omission signaled how the Affordable Care Act's recent troubles have turned the president's signature domestic legislation from an asset to a liability, if not in solidly blue places like Massachusetts then in purple states like Virginia.  At a rally in Virginia a day before Biden's appearance, Obama didn't mention Obamacare, either. He did mention Biden, however.  The vice president's omission may have also signaled something else. In their new book about last year's presidential campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012, due out Tuesday, journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann reported that Obama campaign aides considered dropping Biden from the ticket in favor of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Veteran Obama political strategists like David Axelrod and David Plouffe have denied Biden was ever at risk of being jettisoned.  It's possible to read too much into such moments, of course.

There is very little evidence on how it will affect people's health over the long haul. But people who had surgery maintained substantial weight loss three years later, according to a study that's trying to figure out if it works.  But the amount of weight lost varied according to the type of surgery , and so did the effect on diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol. Researchers say that may have to do with both the type of surgery and variations among the patients. The variation also reflects the fact that there are lots of reasons why people become seriously obese, and doctors aren't sure how treatment should be tailored to match those differences.  Very few studies have tracked people with weight-loss surgery for more than a year. The LABS study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was launched in 2005 to overcome that problem.  The 1,738 people who had Rouen-en-Y gastric bypass surgery , which creates a new connection between the top of the stomach and the small intestine, had maintained a weight loss of about a third nt of their pre-surgery weight three years out, or 90 pounds on average.  The 610 people who had lap-band surgery , where an elastic band is used to make the stomach smaller, maintained an average 16 percent weight loss, or 40 pounds.  The death rate for both surgeries was about the same, at just under 1 percent. But the lap-band patients were much more likely to need further surgery, with 18 percent going in to get things fixed. The median weight for people in the study before surgery was 284 pounds.  Many people end up getting weight-loss surgery because they have diabetes or other weight-related health issues. In the bypass group, almost three-quarters of the people with diabetes had at least a partial remission of the disease. In patients with lap-band surgery, that number was 27 percent. The more invasive gastric bypass was also better at reducing blood pressure and improving lipid levels. \n \n\n Lap-band surgery has been popular because it is less invasive and has a quick recovery time. But because of the need for more operations to adjust the band and deal with other problems, surgeons instead have been turning to vertical sleeve gastrectomy , which reshapes the stomach into a banana-shaped tube but doesn't remove the valves at the top and bottom of the stomach. It also may not interfere with absorption of iron and other nutrients as much as does a Rouen-en-Y bypass. This study didn't evaluate the vertical sleeve procedure.  The LABS study is big, but it's not a randomized trial; the patients chose which surgery they would have. So that could affect the results. The results were published Monday in JAMA , the American Medical Association's journal.  The varied response shows that more effort needs to go into figuring out what type of obesity a person has, and not treating them all the same, according to Alison Field , an epidemiologist at Children's Hospital Boston who studies obesity. She wrote an editorial in JAMA to accompany the report.  \"We don't think all breast cancer should be treated the same \u2014 not at all,\" Field told Shots. \"We need to start thinking the same way with obesity.\"  Current approaches to weight loss, including diets and exercise, result in only small amounts of weight loss when averaged out across the American population, Field notes. And with 70 percent of American adults and 33 percent of children overweight or obese, there are a lot of people who could do with some help. Bariatric surgery isn't appropriate for almost all of those people, she notes. There need to be tailored non-surgical approaches, too.  \"If you look at Weight Watchers, it's focused on education and navigating social situations,\" Field adds. \"It works very well for some people, but not others. We need to figure who the subgroups are and how to match the best treatment to them. We have a ways to go to get there.\"  The LABS study is also looking at how weight-loss surgery affects teenagers, and published a very short-term study Monday in JAMA Pediatrics . It found that 242 teenagers who had bariatric surgery did fairly well in the first 30 days afterwards. Eight percent had major complications, like needing more surgery, and 15 percent had minor complications, like dehydration. That study will continue to see how the teens fare over the next few years.  Weight-loss surgery in children is controversial because they aren't able to give legal consent, and because any ill effects would dog them for many more years than in adults, who typically have bariatric surgery in their 30s or 40s.  Parents and doctors should think about non-medical reasons why surgery may help teenagers, according to Michael Sarr , a bariatric surgeon at the Mayo Clinic. He wrote an editorial in JAMA Pediatrics arguing that having to go through adolescence weighing 300 or 400 pounds can result in \"psychosocial retardation.\"  \"The elephant in the closet is social ostracism and social isolation,\" Sarr told Shots. \"Many of these kids are markedly obese from age 10. They're isolated. They're made fun of. They're excluded from things.\"  That, he says, can stunt a life as much as Type 2 diabetes and other health issues in seriously obese children.", "topics": [], "author": "Nancy Shute", "wordCount": 905}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "What If A Congressman Comes Out And Nobody Cares?", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/11/04/243035126/what-if-a-congressman-comes-out-and-nobody-cares?ft=1&f=1003", "text": "Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Rep.

Mike Michaud talks to an Associated Press reporter Monday in Portland, Maine, about his public announcement that he is gay.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n The final chapter in the history of bombshells of the closeted-gay-politician variety may have been written Monday by Rep. Mike Michaud, a Maine Democrat running for governor.  Michaud, 58, announced in a column published in two state newspapers and by the Associated Press that he is a gay man, and followed it with the question: \"But why should it matter?\"  Judging from immediate reaction in Maine, where Michaud next year will be competing to become the first governor in U.S. history elected as an openly gay man, the answer seemed to be that it probably won't.  \"I don't think this will be a defining issue,\" says MaryEllen FitzGerald, president of the Portland, Maine-based Critical Insights market research and polling firm. \"And I don't think most people are surprised by his announcement.\"  Wrote the Bangor Daily News in an editorial headline: \"Mike Michaud is gay. Welcome this truth and move on.\"  Those on the ground in Maine are predicting that the expected three-way race in 2014 between Michaud, Republican Gov. Paul LePage, and progressive Independent Eliot Cutler remains competitive \u2014 and largely unchanged \u2014 after Monday's not-so-big reveal.  More Help Than Hurt?  One effect, however, could come in the money race. Michaud, the seventh openly gay or bisexual member (all Democrats) currently serving in the House, now becomes a symbol for LGBT supporters nationwide, says Mike Tipping of the Maine People's Resource Center, a non-profit that conducts regular polling and public opinion research.  The congressman's announcement, he says, will likely increase his ability to raise money nationally, and potentially help him siphon some support from Cutler.  \"This is more likely to help him electorally than hurt him,\" Tipping says. \"LePage has locked up conservative support, but there's more fluidity among moderate and progressive voters, going between Michaud and Cutler.\"  \"If anything, this will help him among that voting bloc,\" he says.  Michaud's announcement comes a day before LePage, 65, a Tea Party favorite with high statewide negative ratings, has plans to announce that he'll seek a second term. Cutler, 67, a wealthy environmental lawyer who finished second to LePage in a three-way race in 2010, announced in September that he would run again.  Poll averages show Michaud, a Franco-American Catholic who has held elective office since 1980, leading in both a three-way matchup and in a two-candidate race with LePage.  State of Play  Maine voters last year legalized same-sex marriage, by a vote of 53-47 percent, three years after they had rejected a similar effort. Michaud and Cutler supported the legalization effort; LePage has said that he personally opposes gay marriage, but that it should be up to voters to decide.  Though there remains significant polarization over gay marriage, the antipathy does not appear to extend to candidates' sexual orientation, says FitzGerald, of the Portland market research firm.  \"Mainers have shown tolerance on this and intolerance toward those trying the make that type of thing an issue,\" she said. \"This candidate has a long track record in public service that people can judge him on.\"  Writing in the Portland Press Herald, political reporter Steve Mistler noted that \"rumors about Michaud's sexual orientation have followed the former mill worker throughout his 33-year political career, but have never been reported.\"  Michaud served two terms in the state House, and five in the state Senate. He came to Washington in 2003 after what would prove to be his only close race for Congress \u2014 a 52 to 48 percent victory over Republican Kevin Raye.  He has since easily won re-election in the more rural and conservative of the state's two congressional districts.  \"He worked in a mill, drove a forklift, he doesn't have a college degree, and has among the least personal wealth of anyone in Congress,\" Tipping says. \"There are some other identity politics in this race.\"  In his coming-out column, Michaud suggested that his hand was forced by opponents' \"whisper campaigns, insinuations, and push-polls.\"  The notion that he was somehow outed, however, struck FitzGerald as a bit funny.  \"This is Maine, where nobody is whispering,\" she said. \"This is just one large small town.\"  A town in which Michaud's announcement, whatever prompted it, came as little surprise and, a year from now, may have a marginal effect on what's expected to be a hotly contested election.", "topics": [], "author": "Liz Halloran", "wordCount": 758}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Employment Non-Discrimination Act Passes First Senate Hurdle", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/11/04/243023548/senate-poised-to-pass-employment-non-discrimination-act?ft=1&f=1003", "text": "Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Sen.

The measure, which has been around in various forms for decades, has more Senate support than ever before \u2014 but likely not enough in the GOP-controlled House to become law.  Politico reported Monday that House Speaker John Boehner opposes the legislation, and believes it would cost jobs and lead to frivolous lawsuits.  So far, every Democratic senator and both independents have said they will vote for the bill this year. And there are two Republican co-sponsors, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.  Still, at least five Senate Republicans will have to support ENDA to defeat a filibuster.  Two Republicans \u2014 Orrin Hatch of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 are also expected to support ENDA, although neither has officially stated they will. Both voted for the Senate bill in its current form this summer, when it passed the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this summer.  On Monday, Republican Dean Heller of Nevada added his support for the bill. \"After listening to Nevadans' concerns about this issue from a variety of viewpoints and after numerous conversations with my colleagues, I feel that supporting this legislation is the right thing to do,\" Heller said in a statement.  That puts the tentative vote count at 60, just enough to defeat a filibuster. The bill's advocates hope even more Republicans will throw their support behind the legislation, which they believe would send a strong message of bipartisan support for LGBT protections.  Fred Sainz, the vice president of communications and marketing at the Human Rights Campaign, said the organization has focused its efforts on getting support from Heller, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio.  \"We are cautiously optimistic that we'll be there [on Monday], but we're not taking anything for granted,\" said Sainz. \"Nothing is sure until the vote takes place.\"  Sainz said organizers in seven states have held 150 events to garner grassroots support for ENDA. So far, these events have generated over 200,000 constituent contacts to these prospective senators in support of the bill. Supporters of the legislation have been targeting Portman, in particular, who came out in support of same-sex marriage earlier this year.  Caitlin Dunn, Portman's press secretary, said in an email that the Senator \"agrees with the underlying principle of ENDA and supports ending unjust discrimination based on one's sexual orientation. He doesn't think one of his constituents should be able to be fired just because he or she is gay. The bill as it stands, however, is not perfect, and he continues to discuss his concerns with the bill's sponsors and is exploring ways to strengthen the bill, including its religious liberties provisions.\"  The last time ENDA faced a vote in the Senate was in 1996, when Republicans held the majority. It failed with a final vote of 49-50.  Currently, 29 states have no legislation banning employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and 33 states are without gender identity employment protections.  Federal employment protections that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, and genetic information are already in place.

Oregon has yet to enroll one single person, and it's been reduced to pawing through paper applications to figure out eligibility.  When Cover Oregon opened Oct. 1, executive director Rocky King was excited. He'd been preparing for years. \"Day one, we are accepting applications. And staff at the Oregon Health Authority and Cover Oregon are ready to process those applications,\" he said on opening day.  Back then, King conceded there were still glitches with the website , but he said that by mid-to-late October they'd be worked out. Now it's November, and it's clear that a quick fix is not in the cards. So Cover Oregon has turned to old-fashioned paper applications. People can either download one off the website, or have somebody walk them through it.  NPR made a request to visit a call center to see the process, but was turned down for security reasons.  Instead, spokeswoman Amy Fauver explained how it is working. \"We have on our website right now a place where people who just want to wait, who just want to do it electronically, can give us their e-mail address, and we will e-mail them when the system is fully functional,\" she said.  \n    \n     Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Cover Oregon's website asks people to fill out a paper application online, and then submit it electronically or by mail. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Cover Oregon's website asks people to fill out a paper application online, and then submit it electronically or by mail.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n \"We also hear from a lot of people who are really chomping at the bit to get started. And they want to send in their paper application as soon as they can. Either way is fine with us. \"  Some potential customers are frustrated, though.  Amanda Thomas lives in Oregon but works for an Australian company putting up science exhibitions. As an independent contractor, she has to buy her own health insurance. She says she didn't have good luck on the site when she tried to sign up. Instead, she was guided to a list of insurance brokers.  \"What I ended up doing was calling one of the brokers, literally just picked one off the screen at random, called him and he explained the whole situation in much more detail and much more understandably,\" says Thomas. \"And his advice was wait and sign up later.\"  The paper application is 20 pages long and asks for everything from names and the number of people in your household to pension contributions and alimony payments.  Cover Oregon's Fauver says applicants need to fill it in and send it back. \"And then we do an eligibility determination in house, on their behalf.\"  That means Cover Oregon staff will comb through documents to determine if the person is eligible for a tax credit or for Medicaid. The sporadic functionality of the federal government's HealthCare.Gov website means this eligibility check is a problem. But Cover Oregon's software is also troublesome. \n \n\n \"When we run a test case, a test household to determine eligibility, most of the time it works just fine. But there are times when it doesn't,\" Fauver says. \"It tends to happen more often with more complex households.\"  When the computer system is working, Fauver says that applicants get one of three responses: Eligible, not eligible or pending \u2014 meaning further communication with Cover Oregon staff is necessary. \"We need to get to a place that we are assured that when the system gives a determination, that it's correct.\"  \n \n\n Cover Oregon hopes to avoid what happened to their northern neighbor. Washington State's exchange recently informed 8,000 applicants that they did not, in fact, qualify for as large a tax credit as they'd been told.  But back at Cover Oregon, let's say everything is fine and an applicant is eligible for a tax credit. Then, says Fauver, \"We send them a packet that includes the amount of the tax credit; the different plans that are available to them; and the costs of those plans and a form that they can fill out to say, 'I want plan A'. Then they sign that form and send it back to us.\"  All of this on paper.  Cover Oregon's current guess on when the site will be fully running is by the end of November. So far, it has a stack of 7,300 paper applications, with more coming in each day. It has 45 days to process each one, but it hopes to do that more quickly.", "topics": [], "author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "wordCount": 782}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "New Mayor Asks Compton: What Can Brown Do For You?", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/11/04/242956747/new-mayor-asks-compton-what-can-brown-do-for-you?ft=1&f=1003", "text": "Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Mayor Aja Brown of Compton, Calif., has big plans to turn the city around. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Mayor Aja Brown of Compton, Calif., has big plans to turn the city around.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Aja Brown made history this past summer when she became the youngest mayor in the history of Compton, Calif. There is a lot of buzz there around the charismatic 31-year-old.  The city of about 100,000 people just south of Los Angeles has long struggled with gangs and street violence. But it wasn't always that way. Compton flourished in the '50s and '60s, when its factory jobs were a beacon for African-Americans fleeing the South.  That's the Compton Aja Brown heard about from her family when she was growing up. Now, her grand plan to turn the city around is turning a lot of heads inside and outside of City Hall.  From Rap To Radishes  Most people around the world have heard of Compton in rap lyrics, embedded in drum beats and lines like: \"I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors be cautious, one phone call will have your body dumped.\"  \n    \n     Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       A mural in downtown Compton, Calif., puts Cesar Chavez and Martin Luther King Jr., side by side.

The historically black city is predominantly Hispanic.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Rappers put this city on the map in the '80s and '90s. According to Brown, the reputation is still dragging the city down today.  \"I think that as long as people can recognize Eazy-E and Dr. Dre, we have to work twice as hard to put a new image in front of the world,\" says Brown, who residents voted in handily in July.  Brown says if that image gets fixed, then other, tangible changes will follow. Her rebranding of Compton is already underway here, on this newly redeveloped stretch of Willowbrook Ave.  Walking around Compton's new weekly farmers market, the mayor has shed her signature pumps for flats. Getting the market going was one of the first things she did when she took office. There hasn't been a farmers market in Compton for 25 years.  Brown grew up in nearby Pasadena, but has family roots in Compton. She has two degrees in urban planning from the University of Southern California and isn't lacking in confidence. And there are some early successes beyond just the farmers market to back that up.  Early Successes  Brown has already cut Compton's deep budget deficit nearly in half. She's started a gang intervention and community policing program, an effort to smooth out decades of mistrust between this community and the L.A. County Sheriff's deputies who patrol it. She's also using tax incentives to lure more businesses \u2014 and young professionals like her \u2014 back to the city.  It's all an ambitious agenda that Brown says rests on image and community empowerment. In other cities, she says, citizens have a different relationship with their surroundings.  \"In other communities, people don't throw their trash on the ground. If they see graffiti, they report it,\" she says. \"And so, it really is going to be a change at the citizen's level.\"  It's a little too early to draw comparisons between Brown and fast-rising black politicians like Cory Booker or even Barack Obama in his early days. But there's a wide sense here, in this city plagued by years of corruption at City Hall, that she is going places.  One afternoon, at a new \"Coffee with the Mayor\" event at a local Starbucks, the buzz around Brown in the room is electric. People practically trip over each other to meet her and snap photos with her. Sarah Pendiman, a retired teacher, and her friend Jackie McGee, a retired nurse, stand at the back of the cafe, beaming.  \"I've lived here over 40 years, so it's time for a change,\" says Pendiman. \"And she's a good change.\"  \"We have the capability of being a great city, and we were once,\" McGee adds. \n \n\n  A Lot Of Problems Linger  Make no mistake, there are still a lot of problems here. Unemployment is stubbornly high. A recent weekend brought a slate of deadly drive-by shootings. It was a grim reminder that Brown's new gang and youth development initiatives have their work ahead of them. And earlier this year, the perennial racial tensions between blacks and Latinos were again thrust into the spotlight with two hate crimes .  Lifelong Compton resident Julius Franklin describes himself as half-black and half-Latino, and was among hundreds to attend a unity rally in the days after those hate crimes.

Brown says emphatically that City Hall has to start looking more like the city itself. She points out that in this past summer's election, voters also elected Compton's first Latino council member.

At least, that's a trend that the Chicago-based sports graphics company Sportvision is banking on.  \"With wide-screen TVs and high definition, and these man caves and all the graphics and data that we give you that they can't replicate at the game, a lot of fans are saying, 'I'd rather stay home and watch it,' \" says Hank Adams, the company's CEO.  If you watch sports on TV, you probably know Sportvision, if not by name. The company adds those colorful, on-screen graphics to live sports events, like the virtual strike zone box that logs trajectory of a baseball pitch as it crosses the plate, the country flags magically hovering over America's Cup yachts and, of course, the company's best known invention \u2014 football's first-down \"yellow line.\"  That's the line \u2014 trademark name Virtual Yellow 1st & Ten \u2014 that looks like it's painted on the field during game play. Sportvision debuted it with ESPN back in 1998.  \n    \n     \n  \n  \n\n  \n       The glowing hockey puck known as FoxTrax debuted during the National Hockey League All-Star game on Fox television in 1996. It wasn't a hit with fans, but it helped Sportvision develop its more successful football graphics. \n  \n  \n\n \n \n\n  'The Guys Who Draw The Yellow Line'  Adams has tried to describe his business in other terms, he tells All Things Considered host Audie Cornish, but \"in spite of everything else that we do, people keep coming back to that ... I try and then eventually just default to, 'Well, we're the guys who draw the yellow line.' \"  The company hatches all its technologies in Silicon Valley, in a Mountain View, Calif., lab staff call \"the war room.\" It's a giant warehouse space where you'll find stray football helmets trimmed with infrared lights pining down piles of paper. TV cameras are mounted on high-rise platforms in the corners of the room.  The cameras are all trained toward the floor, a replica of an NFL field painted green and white. It's one-eighth of the actual size and would take about 10 strides to cover from end zone to end zone.  There are infrared and motion sensors in NFL stadiums around the country just like the ones around this model, and they all do the same thing: map and track everything on the field and send that data to Sportvision. Sportvision then creates a computer-generated graphic superimposed over the broadcast; in this case, a yellow line.  It's a lot like the so-called green screen technology that your local TV weather team uses. But the Sportvision technology, Adams says, is a bit more sophisticated.  \"In football, it's not so easy, because it's grass and painted logos and football pads and pants that can get grass stains on them,\" Adams explains. \"It's a very tough thing for us, to distinguish between, say, the Green Bay Packers' green pants and the color of their field.\"  It's been a game of trial and error over the years, Adams says, to figure out how to perfect the technology.  \"For a graphical enhancement to work, it has to be something that's hard to see, happens a lot and is really important to the game,\" Adams says. \"And if we can meet those three criteria, it turns out to be very successful for us.\"  \n    \n     Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Sportvision uses helicopter and water-based platforms to superimpose the national flags of competing teams over broadcasts of the America's Cup sailing competitions. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Sportvision uses helicopter and water-based platforms to superimpose the national flags of competing teams over broadcasts of the America's Cup sailing competitions.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n That \"yellow line,\" for example, grew out of a technology hockey fans may remember: \"the famous, or infamous, glowing puck,\" Adams says.  Known as FoxTrax, the puck had electronics embedded inside that tracked its movement across the ice during live play. \"Some people loved it, some people hated it,\" Adams explains. After two years of use, NHL ratings were down and the puck was dropped.  \"For the hard core hockey fan, they felt that it was over-the-top,\" Adams says. \"If we ever did it again, we'd be a lot more subtle about it \u2014 we'd do it in replay.\"  Next Up: Soccer. Maybe.  It's easiest to come up with virtual enhancements like these for sports like football or NASCAR, because they provide lots of equipment to tack sensors to. It's not so simple for games with mostly bare skin and movement, like basketball or soccer.  That last sport holds particular appeal for the company \u2014 but the challenges for soccer go beyond the technical side.  \"As a business person, I'm obviously attracted to the thought of enhancing soccer. Because it is the world's biggest sport, clearly. And from our perspective, there's been very little done to improve the quality of that broadcast. They have been doing the same way for 50 years in that sport,\" Adams says.  \"In fact, when we took our technology over and said, 'Hey, we can track the players and put virtual off-side markers and arrows down to certain players and show you things in real time,' the European broadcasters put their arms up and said, 'Oh, we are never going to do that crazy stuff you Americans do.' \"  But, Adams points out, people \"screamed and yelled and rebelled\" when a score box was first added to screens in the United Kingdom a couple of decades ago.  \"And lo and behold, now you can't see a game in any sport that doesn't have the live score on,\" Adams says. \"Now, of course, it's just the fabric of what we see. So I think [the soccer leagues'] attitudes are changing there as well.\"", "topics": [], "author": "NPR Staff", "wordCount": 1050}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Why Are Pig Farmers Still Using Growth-Promoting Drugs?", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/11/04/241603861/why-are-pig-farmers-still-using-growth-promoting-drugs?ft=1&f=1003", "text": "Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Hogs at a farm in Buckhart, Ill. in June 2012.

In recent years, pork producers have found ways to keep the animals healthy through improved hygiene.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n It's one of the most controversial practices in agriculture: Feeding small amounts of antibiotics to animals in order to make them grow faster.  But what if the drugs don't even work very well?  There's some good evidence that they don't, at least in pigs. They used to deliver a boost in growth, but that effect has disappeared in recent years, or declined greatly.  The reason for this is interesting, and even paradoxical.  Researchers think the antibiotics used to work by suppressing low-grade infections. In recent years, however, pork producers found other ways to accomplish the same thing through improved hygiene. This has occurred even while swine operations grow in size. As a result, the drugs have become largely superfluous \u2014 yet many farmers still use them. \n \n\n To understand how this happened, you have to step back in time, says Steve Dritz , a specialist in swine nutrition at Kansas State University.  Sixty years ago, when antibiotics were new, \"people started treating animals, and feeding [the antibiotics], and finding that they had increased growth rates and feed efficiencies,\" says Dritz. Nursery-age pigs, for instance, grew 12 to 15 percent faster with antibiotics. The animals also needed less feed to reach full weight. Other studies showed similar results in chickens and cattle.  In the 1980s, a new set of studies found similar effects. So the growth-promoting effects of antibiotics became standard practice among meat producers.  Fast-forward to the 1990s. Dritz was starting his career as a scientist at Kansas State University, and pork production was changing dramatically. \"We instituted this thing called multi-site production,\" says Dritz.  Previously, pigs were born and raised in one barn, or in several barns close together. This meant infections could easily pass from one generation to the next, the way that kids share germs between their friends on the playground and their parents at home.  Under the new system, when piglets are weaned, they move to a whole different place. That new site is carefully scrubbed and free of disease.  Craig Rowles , who runs a large swine operation in Carroll, Iowa, shows me one such room. There's not a piglet in sight. \"This room just got completely washed and disinfected, and now it's going to sit here and dry for a while,\" he says.  A whole group of pigs will come in here together, and later they will move out together to yet another site. \"That group of pigs will stay together until they go to market,\" says Rowles.  \n    \n     Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Craig Rowles raises pigs near Carroll, Iowa. The piglets will enter and leave this room as a group. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Craig Rowles raises pigs near Carroll, Iowa. The piglets will enter and leave this room as a group.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n The groups are kept strictly separated from each other. If workers move between the groups, they'll first have to change their boots.  When farmers adopted multi-site production, it cut down on disease \u2014 and pigs actually grew faster.  So Dritz wondered whether improved hygiene was delivering exactly the same growth-promoting effect that farmers used to get through antibiotics. If so, did they still need to use the drugs?  Dritz carried out some studies on pigs in these multi-site systems, comparing animals that received antibiotics with others that didn't. \"Lo and behold, in these studies, there wasn't nearly the magnitude of the growth response,\" he says.  In the \"finishing\" stage, the effect of antibiotics disappeared. Younger pigs grew a little bit faster with antibiotics, but the effect was smaller than had been observed earlier.  Dritz started telling pork producers that using antibiotics for growth promotion or feed efficiency really did not make sense anymore. Many farmers took his advice. But he was surprised and a little discouraged to see how many did not. They weren't convinced by the evidence.  \"It's very hard to change people's perceptions,\" he says. Even among veterinarians , his professional colleagues, there was reluctance to change. Many continue to recommend using the drugs.  Dritz thinks that this is partly rooted in psychology and the professional culture of veterinary practice. Veterinarians \"are action-oriented people, most of them. They want to do something. Not doing something just doesn't seem right, as a professional, you know?\"  Once upon a time, this would have been left for farmers and their vets to hash out, but the use of antibiotics on the farm now is the focus of intense controversy. Critics of the meat industry say using these drugs to promote growth is irresponsible , because it increases the chances that bacteria will develop resistance to antibiotics, and some of these bacteria can infect humans.  The Food and Drug Administration now says that medically important antibiotics should not be used for this purpose. It is trying to persuade drug companies to stop selling drugs for growth promotion. Within a few years, such uses of antibiotics may no longer be legal.  Among farmers, there's some grumbling about this. But at least for pork producers, dropping the drugs may actually save them money.", "topics": [], "author": "Dan Charles", "wordCount": 881}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Johns Hopkins Halts, Reviews Black Lung Program", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/11/04/243029509/johns-hopkins-halts-reviews-black-lung-program?ft=1&f=1003", "text": "Johns Hopkins Medicine says it will suspend and review its black lung program, following joint investigative reports last week from the Center for Public Integrity and ABC News that found the program \"helped coal companies thwart efforts by ailing mine workers to receive disability benefits.\"  The medical school and hospital system at Johns Hopkins University said in a statement, \"We take very seriously the questions raised\" in the reports.  CPI and ABC focused on Dr. Paul Wheeler, who heads a unit at John Hopkins Medicine that reads X-rays of coal miners seeking compensation benefits for black lung disease. Wheeler has become a favorite X-ray reader for industry lawyers, according to the reports, because he \"found not a single case of severe black lung in the more than 1,500 cases decided since 2000 in which he offered an opinion.\"  The investigations also found that other experienced X-ray readers disagreed with some of Wheeler's analyses.

Policy recommendations include stronger parental leave policies, mental-health services for new mothers and broader access to quality, affordable day care and preschool \n. \u201cAll children need nurturing and plentiful opportunities to develop during their crucial first eight years,\u201d said Patrick McCarthy, president and chief executive of the foundation. \u201cToday\u2019s complicated world can strain families\u2019 ability to ensure their children are receiving all the stimulation and care they need to develop to their full potential,\u201d he said.

McAuliffe sought to hold onto a lead reflected in all recent polls, appearing with Vice President Biden in Fairfax County and urging Democrats to do what many Virginians skip in off-year elections: vote. Cuccinelli joined conservative stars Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former representative Ron Paul of Texas in a final push to motivate his base by tying McAuliffe to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act. Biden told Democrats gathered in Annandale that McAuliffe would beat back a tea party movement that \u201cis antithetical to everything this great state has been known for throughout its history.\u201d Rubio urged Republicans at a pair of rallies to back Cuccinelli and send this message: \u201cWe don\u2019t want Obamacare. We don\u2019t want more big government.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s election was expected to be widely watched as a window into Virginia\u2019s continuing political evolution into a hotly contested swing state. While Obama won the state in both 2008 and 2012, the state\u2019s congressional delegation, governor\u2019s office and House of Delegates are controlled by Republicans. In off-years such as this one, Democrats typically struggle to turn out some of the voters who helped push Obama to victory, notably young and nonwhite residents. Biden\u2019s appearance, less than 24 hours before polls were set to open and one day after Obama headlined another rally in nearby Arlington County, was a direct effort to change that pattern. Their combined firepower also signifies the importance that national Democrats are putting on the race as a test of the party\u2019s message ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections. A crowd of roughly 300 Democrats waited in sub-40-degree weather in the back yard of Alex Rodriguez, an Annandale businessman and party activist, to hear Biden and McAuliffe before heading out to knock on doors across Northern Virginia. \u201cThis is a choice between the mainstream and the extreme,\u201d Biden said, echoing Obama\u2019s rhetoric from Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s what this race is about.\u201d Forty miles west, Rubio told the few hundred people gathered in the Stoneridge Events Center in Warrenton that Tuesday\u2019s election is the first chance for voters to issue a referendum on the new health-care law. \u201cThis race \u2014 not just for governor, but right down the ballot \u2014 gives you an opportunity to choose between two very different visions about how we can make Virginia and America a place where anyone from anywhere can accomplish anything,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cNow, what do they stand for? What do the Democrats in this race stand for? They stand for the same failed policies that have never worked anywhere they\u2019ve ever been tried and won\u2019t work here.\u201d By the time Cuccinelli reached the Warrenton reception hall, his voice was starting to go hoarse as he again gave a speech that ridiculed the health-care law and urged the crowd to knock on doors and ask their friends, neighbors and co-workers to vote Tuesday. But the jokes he had made before \u2014 suggesting that he might change the rules for daylight saving time and making fun of the government\u2019s attempts to build functioning health-care Web sites \u2014 still incited roars of laughter and applause.   Several of the Republican candidates and representatives who spoke Monday tried to appeal to minority voters. Rubio gave a short address in Spanish. And E.W. Jackson, the Chesapeake minister who is running for lieutenant governor and doesn\u2019t often attend events with Cuccinelli, said that Republican candidates have been misrepresented in the media. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cWe want to serve every Virginian, no matter the color of their skin,\u201d Jackson said, as about a dozen \u201cJackson\u201d signs waved in the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ve been reaching out to those black Virginians, Hispanic Virginians, Asian Virginians, Indian Virginians and telling them: You\u2019ve been lied to. You\u2019ve been told we don\u2019t care about you. There\u2019s a difference between us and them. For them, you are pawns on their political chessboard.\u201d Lillian Reed, 69, attended the rally with her husband, both dressed in shirts that featured the Constitution and red, white and blue hats. \u201cThat was awesome,\u201d Reed, who lives in Warrenton, said as the event ended. \u201cHe\u2019s a constitutionalist. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s going to send a message to this country. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m just praying that America wakes up.\u201d In Culpeper, Cuccinelli told a crowd of several hundred people that the race is close and could be won by just a few hundred votes. He pointed out that in his previous four races \u2014 three for the state\u2019s General Assembly and one for attorney general \u2014 he has been outspent by his opponent and still won. \u201cIf we win tomorrow by a small number of votes, I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Cuccinelli said Monday. \n\n After Annandale, McAuliffe traveled to a shopping center in suburban Richmond to rally supporters at a campaign office. Accompanied by two former Democratic governors \u2014 Sens. Mark R. Warner and Timothy M. Kaine \u2014 McAuliffe said he would work across party lines but also indicated he would not compromise on abortion rights. \u201cI will be a brick wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI trust women to make their own decisions on their own personal health choices. I will be a brick wall on those issues.\u201d Warner revved up the crowd with, \u201cYou all ready to win?\u201d Kaine noted that he and Warner would have to head to Washington right after the event so they could vote on a measure to protect gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination. \u201cIt is good to stand together with a ticket that I can support with the complete knowledge that they view that \u2014 equality, fairness, the right treatment of people, anti-discrimination \u2014 as a core value not only personally, but a core value of what the commonwealth of Virginia stands for,\u201d Kaine said, giving a nod to the other statewide Democratic candidates present, state Sen. Ralph S. Northam of Norfolk, who is running for lieutenant governor, and state Sen. Mark R. Herring of Loudoun, who is running for attorney general. The last day before polls open began with the release of what will likely be the final independent survey of the race. A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday shows McAuliffe at 46 percent, Cuccinelli at 40 percent and Libertarian Robert Sarvis at 8 percent among likely voters. The previous Quinnipiac survey of the race, released last week, showed McAuliffe ahead by 4 points, leading Cuccinelli and his allies to argue that the race was tightening. But other polls have shown larger leads \u2014 the last Washington Post poll had McAuliffe ahead 12 points \u2014 and the vast majority of surveys taken in the past couple of months have put the Democrat ahead between 5 and 9 points. \n\n As in other polls, McAuliffe enjoys a significant lead among women \u2014 14 points \u2014 while Cuccinelli\u2019s popularity numbers are upside down: The Republican has a 38 percent favorable, 52 percent unfavorable rating. McAuliffe\u2019s score is 42-45. \n fredrick.kunkle@washpost.com", "topics": [], "author": "Ben Pershing and Jenna Johnson and Fredrick Kunkle", "wordCount": 1178}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Senate close to passing bill to ban discrimination against gay workers", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334cbb95/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Csenate0Eclose0Eto0Epassing0Ebill0Eto0Eban0Ediscrimination0Eagainst0Egay0Eworkers0C20A130C110C0A40C9a0Af40A8c0E45820E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "The Senate moved closer to passing a historic piece of legislation Monday that would ban discrimination against gay workers, signaling a dramatic shift in political attitudes on the issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Seven Republicans joined 54 members of the Democratic caucus in voting to formally begin considering the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).

They note that most opponents, including Boehner, have focused their concerns on allegations that the legislation would benefit trial lawyers and have shied away from the morality and family-values questions that once dominated the issue.\n \u201cThere\u2019s been a softer tone, and there\u2019s been a recognition that anti-gay politics that may have worked in 2000 and in 2004 don\u2019t work anymore,\u201d said Jeff Cook-McCormac, senior adviser to the American Unity Fund, a pro-gay-rights group funded by Republican mega-donors. \n\n The roll call on the vote produced a rare moment of Senate drama, as a trio of prominent Republicans \u2014 Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) \u2014 holed up in the GOP cloakroom off the floor deciding at the last minute whether to back the legislation. Democrats needed those GOP votes to clear the 60-vote hurdle because a couple of supporters were absent. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the legislation\u2019s main sponsor, negotiated with the GOP holdouts over the bill\u2019s final details, and almost 40 minutes after the roll call began, the three Republicans voted for the measure. A decade ago, the political calculation was far different. The brain trust of President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection team encouraged a series of state ballot initiatives banning same-sex marriage as a way to draw more conservatives to the polls. In 2006, running into the head winds of a midterm election, Senate Republicans pushed legislation that would have imposed a federal ban on same-sex marriage \u2014 in large part because GOP advisers considered it a winning political maneuver , even as it fell well short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Even when Democrats held 60 Senate seats in 2009, the majority did not advance ENDA, partly out of fear that some incumbents in conservative-leaning states would not be able to support the measure because of a potential political backlash.   Those attitudes have changed in the past three years, beginning with the vote in December 2010 to end the military\u2019s ban on service by openly gay members. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Supporters of the legislation noted that 21 states and the District of Columbia have laws that prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, and almost 10 more have had some protections through executive orders by governors. \n On Monday, after seven years in the minority, Senate Republicans provided the key margin to advance the gay rights bill, along with a handful of Democrats from deep red states who a few years ago might have feared the political fallout from supporting the legislation. In the hours leading up to the vote, no Republicans went to the floor to publicly oppose the measure. The only Republicans to speak were those in favor of the legislation, including Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.), who used his first Senate floor speech since having a stroke two years ago to support the bill. The other Republicans who supported the key procedural vote were Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Dean Heller (Nevada) and Orrin G. Hatch (Utah). The political push has been similar to the effort to end the \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy in the military, focusing on appealing to conservative values of wanting to help capable people join the workforce. \u201cWe\u2019re the party that focuses on the people\u2019s ability to do the job,\u201d said former senator Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), whom the American Unity Fund hired to lobby on behalf of the antidiscrimination measure. A small but vocal bloc of conservative groups has been trying to rally opposition to the legislation, including the Family Research Council and Heritage Action for America . \u201cIt would not protect equality under the law, but create special privileges that are enforceable against private actors,\u201d Ryan Anderson of Heritage wrote last week . Those groups, however, do not have the financial resources that the other side has, particularly American Unity, which has been seeded with donations from Paul Singer, a billionaire chief executive of a hedge fund. Another backer of the group is former Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman, who was Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign manager. Now a Wall Street executive, Mehlman announced in 2010 that he is gay. The coordination between these Republicans and liberal gay rights groups would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Now, they are working hand in hand. On Friday morning, Democratic press secretaries received a briefing on the non-discrimination legislation that was led by the Human Rights Campaign, a well-funded group supporting gay rights. The Democratic group received a briefing on polling that was delivered by Target Point Consulting, a GOP polling firm that once advised Mitt Romney. Other GOP strategists have joined the effort, in part because of their own experience with gay friends or relatives, and in part because many Republicans believe that their political survival in the long run depends on softening the party\u2019s long-standing opposition to gay rights. Target Point\u2019s polling data showed that more than 80\u00a0percent of voters think that discrimination against gay workers is already illegal. When asked whether they support a federal law that \u201cprotects gay and transgender people from employment discrimination,\u201d 56\u00a0percent of Republicans said yes, according to the firm\u2019s polling. That has been the message that Coleman and former congressman Thomas M. Reynolds (R-N.Y.), who is also lobbying for American Unity, have been pushing to GOP lawmakers. They have cautioned that this vote does not mean a lawmaker supports same-sex marriage, but is instead a vote to help the economy. \u201cIt should be an easy vote for Republicans,\u201d said Coleman, who remains opposed to same-sex marriage. Even on the issue, attitudes are shifting quickly. In deep-red South Carolina, 52\u00a0percent of voters still oppose same-sex , but that number is down from 78\u00a0percent in 2006, when the state\u2019s voters easily approved a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. In the House, 193 lawmakers have signed on as co-sponsors of the non-discrimination act, including six Republicans.", "topics": [], "author": "Paul Kane", "wordCount": 1161}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "SAC agrees to plead guilty to insider trading, pay $1.2 billion penalty", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/33496673/sc/30/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cbusiness0Ceconomy0Csac0Esettlement0Eto0Ebe0Eannounced0Ethis0Eafternoon0C20A130C110C0A40C8c2757840E455f0E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "The beleaguered hedge fund owned by billionaire Steven A. Cohen agreed to pay $1.2\u00a0billion to settle charges that it tolerated rampant insider trading for more than a decade, a deal that could sink one of Wall Street\u2019s big success stories and crush its owner\u2019s vaunted reputation. SAC Capital Advisors agreed to plead guilty to each of the five counts in a criminal indictment unveiled in July by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The Connecticut-based firm would stop managing the money of outside investors if the deal is approved by the courts. It can continue to manage Cohen\u2019s sizeable fortune, but would have to do so under the eye of an independent compliance consultant. The plea agreement, announced Monday, marks the culmination of a multi-year effort to close in on a storied hedge fund that has racked up stellar profits since Cohen founded it in 1992. It also represents one of the most high-profile successes in the government\u2019s aggressive push to purge Wall Street of insider trading and hold wrongdoers accountable. Since Bharara took office in August 2009, he has filed insider-trading charges against 87 defendants and convicted 75 of them \u2014 including hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, who is now behind bars, and his friend Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs board member who was found guilty of divulging boardroom secrets to Rajaratnam. Under Monday\u2019s deal, SAC agreed to pay $900\u00a0million in fines and forfeit an additional $900\u00a0million, for a total of $1.8\u00a0billion, a record for an insider- trading case. But the firm will receive a $616\u00a0million credit for civil settlements it reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March involving alleged insider trading at two SAC affiliates. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of SAC as the markets have come to know it,\u201d said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor and a former SEC enforcement lawyer. \u201cToday\u2019s plea will kick the pedestal out from under Cohen\u2019s long-enjoyed lofty status on Wall Street.\u201d In a statement, SAC said that it takes responsibility for the \u201chandful of men\u201d who have pleaded guilty to insider trading while at the firm. Early in the day, SAC\u2019s statement said that it \u201chas never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading.\u201d That language disappeared in the afternoon and the statement instead said: \u201cEven one person crossing the line into illegal behavior is too many and we greatly regret this conduct occurred.\u201d None of the cases that the government has settled with the hedge fund accuse Cohen of criminal wrongdoing. But he remains a target of a separate civil proceeding by the SEC, which recently charged him with failing to supervise two of the firm\u2019s employees in insider-trading incidents. If the SEC wins, Cohen might be banned from the industry for life. On Monday, Bharara implied that Cohen remains in his office\u2019s crosshairs, too, saying that the plea agreement does not provide criminal protection or immunity for any individuals. Bharara described the deal as a \u201cfair but steep\u201d resolution.   \u201cNo institution should rest easy in the belief that it is too big to jail,\u201d Bharara said when announcing the agreement. \u201cThat is a moral hazard that a just society can ill afford.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The deal is likely to eat into the considerable wealth amassed by Cohen, whose net worth is estimated at $9 billion by Forbes magazine. None of the $1.8 billion will be paid by outside investors, which means that Cohen or his various entities must pony up the cash, according to legal experts tracking the case. All the funds will go to the U.S. Treasury, Bharara said. Investors have pulled billions of dollars in recent months from Cohen\u2019s hedge fund, which managed $15 billion in assets at its peak. Nearly all the money left over belongs to Cohen. When prosecutors announced the criminal charges leveled against SAC in July, Bharara described the hedge fund as a \u201cveritable magnet for market cheaters.\u201d The indictment portrayed a pressure-cooker culture that encouraged illegal tips in the quest for profits. Bharara said SAC \u201cseeded itself\u201d with corrupt traders and then turned a blind eye to suspicious activity, which is why he went after the company, not just its employees. In the past few years, eight SAC employees have either been accused or convicted of insider trading that took place from 1999 through 2010. Five have pleaded guilty, and two \u2014 Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg \u2014 are fighting the allegations in court. Prosecutors say the hedge fund failed to detect any of the employees\u2019 misconduct. It even hired Richard Lee despite warnings that he had been involved in an \u201cinsider trading group\u201d at his prior firm, prosecutors said. Only once in its history did SAC identify possible insider trading at its firm, the indictment said. But it did not fire the individuals involved or report the matter to federal authorities. Prosecutors did not mention Cohen by name in the indictment. But they said that the corrupt employees at times recommended trades to the \u201cSAC owner\u201d based on illegal tips. Tying Cohen directly to insider trading has proved elusive, in part because none of the current or former employees charged turned on him. Now, all eyes are on Steinberg and Martoma, who face trial in mid-November and January, respectively. \u201cThe people who testified against Rajaratnam were lifetime friends,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School. \u201cBut people facing years in prison can give up on friendships.\u201d", "topics": [], "author": "Dina ElBoghdady", "wordCount": 885}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Editorial: TSA officers stand in harm\u2019s way to keep skies safe", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334d5a1c/sc/10/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Copinions0Ctsa0Eagents0Estand0Ein0Eharms0Eway0Eto0Ekeep0Eskies0Esafe0C20A130C110C0A40C0A524c6820E459f0E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "BEFORE LAST Friday , Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers were little more than agents of inconvenience to the frustrated traveling public \u2014 brigades of blue-shirted guards demanding your belt and shoes, and then that shampoo bottle you left in your suitcase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t On Friday, however, a TSA officer fell in the line of duty for the first time, the victim of an allegedly disturbed man with an assault rifle who said he wanted to \u201cinstill fear in your traitorous minds.\u201d  What the suspect accomplished, other than horrifying the nation by allegedly slaying that officer and wounding two others and a high school teacher \n\n, was to start \n a debate about making airport security checkpoints safer . But the tragedy should also encourage Americans to appreciate those who do the thankless work of running the airline security system Congress set up. It\u2019s early to draw big conclusions about the shooting at Los Angeles International Airport . But a raft of ideas already is floating around. One is to introduce nearly 50,000 more guns into the country\u2019s airports by arming every TSA officer. Unless a massive amount of time and money goes into that effort, it could well add more danger than it subtracts. The president of the union representing TSA officers has called for giving them arrest powers . But it\u2019s not clear how that would make anyone safer from deranged gunmen. The TSA could push to redesign security checkpoints or to post armed officers at specific locations near screening zones. These measures are worth thinking about, but they could also be costly relative to the security benefits. The truth is that there will always be various risks at these checkpoints. The TSA officers\u2019 job is to filter out the biggest dangers; in order to create a controlled airport environment on the other side, the checkpoints have to be exposed to the outside world and are filled with mobs of people. And they are conspicuous symbols of a security system that, though necessary to make terrorist attacks and hijackings more difficult, some Americans detest. That is only one of the reasons why Americans should appreciate, not disrespect, TSA officers. Most officers will never have to face a hostile shooter. But all of them must deal with the mundane, everyday toil of enforcing all the rules on an often impatient public. The last time the TSA was making big headlines, it was the butt of ridicule. \u201c Don\u2019t touch my junk ,\u201d an uncooperative passenger warned a TSA screener about to perform a pat-down inspection. A video of the encounter incited a brief flap about airport security routines that only seem to get more time-consuming and invasive, triggering frustration that too often is taken out on those at the bottom of the TSA apparatus. Union leaders had to insist that the TSA\u2019s screeners \u2014 some of whom had to look at revealing X-ray images of passengers, others of whom have to perform those pat-downs \u2014 are not \u201cperverts.\u201d Though incidents were not widespread, TSA officers reported being mocked, threatened, even butted in the head.

Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee \u2014 both facing primary challenges from the right \u2014 are responding more forcefully to their populist opponents. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has cut ties with a Republican advertising firm employed by tea party challengers. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do business,\u201d says a spokesman, \u201cwith people who profit off of attacking Republicans. Purity for profit is a disease that threatens the Republican Party.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t This vivid turn of phrase \u2014 \u201cpurity for profit\u201d \u2014 captures the main reason Republican leaders are edging away from a strategy of accommodation. The Obama era has unleashed a great deal of genuine populist and libertarian energy. But a good portion of it is being channeled into business and fundraising models that depend on stoking resentment against the GOP itself (at least as currently constituted).  The result is a paradox. Over the past few decades, Republican members of Congress have become more reliably conservative (as their Democratic colleagues, to a lesser extent, have become more liberal). Liberal Republicanism has essentially ceased to exist. This means that tea party conservatives are revolting against a more uniformly conservative party. The RINOs they hunt are actually an endangered species. So they have transformed tactical disagreements \u2014 over, say, a hopeless attempt to defund Obamacare \u2014 into defining ideological struggles. Some of this results from a deep, even apocalyptic, conviction that Obamacare represents the final ruin of the old republic, requiring desperate measures. But the political change we are witnessing is also structural and technological. Matt Kibbe , the president and chief executive of FreedomWorks , described it well: \u201c You\u2019re really seeing a disintermediation in politics .\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. Grass-roots activists have an ability to self-organize, to fund candidates they\u2019re more interested in, going right around the Republican National Committee and senatorial committee. That\u2019s the new reality. Everything\u2019s more democratized and Republicans should come to terms with that. They still want to control things from the top down, and if they do that there will absolutely be a split. But my prediction would be that we take over the Republican Party, and they go the way of the Whigs.\u201d\n The disintermediation of American politics is undeniable. The Internet allows people to find the like-minded , feed the intensity of their mutually held convictions and organize more swiftly and effectively. (It also allows people to filter out opposing views, anonymously attack their opponents and spread conspiracy theories.) This has become a powerful channel of influence outside the political parties \u2014 and is increasingly directed against the Republican Party. The Ron Paul and the tea party movements have prospered in this atmosphere. Policy entrepreneurs , political advisers and media personalities are monetizing this trend. In the tech-driven balkanization of American politics, Freedonia is a major power. But the interests of Freedonia are substantially different from those of the Republican Party. Tea party candidates \u2014 recall Sharron Angle , Christine O\u2019Donnell , Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin \u2014 often lose winnable races. Tea party primary challenges, and the fear of them, encourage a harsher ideological tone among sitting Republican legislators, undermining their general-election appeal to independents, minorities and young people. And maximal tea party legislative strategies, as we\u2019ve just seen, can be ruinous. Yet within an ideological bubble, success is defined differently \u2014 in purity, combativeness and the acclaim of the faithful. As the public standing of the GOP recently reached its lowest point ever , Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) told a cheering tea party audience, \u201c Look, the Democrats are feeling the heat. \u201d It is one thing to engage in Pickett\u2019s Charge; another to describe it as a victory. The Republican Party, in the business of winning elections, has little choice but to respond. But an effective, long-term response will require conservatives to understand that political parties exist for good reasons. Jesse Norman\u2019s recent biography, \u201c Edmund Burke: The First Conservative ,\u201d makes the case that Burke (a Rockingham Whig) helped found the modern party system. In Burke\u2019s view, parties (while hardly perfect instruments) promote civil cooperation in common goals, encourage leaders to rise above factional interests and channel public sentiments into realistic strategies and policies. \u201cBurke thus strikes a subtle balance: political parties must be strong and disciplined enough to hold government to account,\u201d writes Norman. \u201cBut they must not be made so partisan that they lose sight of the public interest and undermine the deliberative function of Parliament.\u201d In this case, conservatives would be well advised to listen to a Whig. \n\n Read more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive , follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook \n .", "topics": [], "author": "Michael Gerson", "wordCount": 776}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "California donor disclosure case exposes how nonprofits can play in politics", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334a8c75/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Ccalifornia0Edonor0Edisclosure0Ecase0Eexposes0Ehow0Enonprofits0Eplay0Ein0Epolitics0C20A130C110C0A40C70Ae0Ab7ac0E42460E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "From coast to coast, election contests are increasingly being influenced by well-funded nonprofit organizations that disclose little about their donors or how they operate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t But new revelations in California provide an unusual look at one national network of such groups that helped move $15\u00a0million into ballot-initiative campaigns last fall while working hard to hide the identities of their prominent financial backers. A pair of conservative nonprofits at the heart of the effort were together fined a record $1\u00a0million after a year-long state investigation, while two political committees were ordered to repay the state for $15\u00a0million in donations they received. \u201cIt is clear that people are willing to use circuitous routes to avoid telling the voters who\u2019s behind campaigns,\u201d said Ann Ravel, a new Democratic appointee to the Federal Election Commission who helped oversee the California inquiry as a state official. Several of the advocacy groups at the center of the California case have played significant roles in national elections, including Americans for Job Security, Americans for Responsible Leadership and the American Future Fund. Those three groups have reported more than $68\u00a0million in campaign-related expenditures during the past two election cycles, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Because they are set up as nonprofit organizations rather than political committees, the groups are not required to disclose their financial supporters to the FEC. \n\n\n The details of the California scheme, revealed in interviews and a cache of investigative documents, show how political operatives casually shuffled around massive sums with little accountability. At one point, a consultant involved sent a text message requesting $11\u00a0million. The case also spotlights the extreme measures that operatives took to skirt disclosure regulations, passing along funds through a daisy chain of organizations without knowing which groups would get the cash or whether the money would end up where it was intended. \n\n The episode was set in motion by Tony Russo, a Republican political strategist in Sacramento who sought to spend $25\u00a0million on issue ads last fall in two state \u00adballot-initiative campaigns without reporting who gave the money. He turned for help to Sean Noble, a GOP operative plugged into a national network of conservative groups. The two agreed to a money swap: Russo sent money to an Arizona group that Noble ran, in the hopes that Noble would get other organizations to send similar amounts back into California, masking the original donors. \u201cI said, \u2018Sean, you know, I have a big hiccup in California,\u2019\u200a\u201d Russo later recounted for state investigators. \u201c\u200a\u2018Can we support some of your national efforts and, in turn, do you have groups that can help us in California?\u2019 That was pretty much as simple as it was.\u201d But the plan was far from simple \u2014 or effective. In the end, about $10\u00a0million of the nearly $25\u00a0million that Russo\u2019s group transferred to Noble\u2019s operation never made it back to California. Outmatched by labor unions and other supporters of Gov. Jerry Brown (D) , Russo and his allies lost both initiative campaigns. And many of the original donors whose identities they sought to protect were outed as a result of the investigation. The names can be deciphered from a partially redacted list of 150 donors that Russo\u2019s attorneys provided to the California attorney general\u2019s office as part of the inquiry.   Many of the original donors whose identities they sought to protect were also outed as a result of the investigation. The names can be deciphered from a partially redacted list of 150 donors that Russo\u2019s lawyers provided to the California attorney general\u2019s office as part of the inquiry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The partially visible list reveals members of the Fisher family, who founded clothing retailer the Gap and gave more than $9\u00a0million; San Francisco investor Charles Schwab, who gave more than $6\u00a0million; and Las Vegas casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson, who with his wife contributed $500,000. One particularly surprising contributor was real-estate magnate and philanthropist Eli Broad, a longtime supporter of Democrats , who gave $500,000 to the effort. All the donors declined to comment or confirm their role. \n The interstate swap \n Dubbed the \u201cCalifornia Comeback\u201d by organizers, the initiative campaign was inspired by the success of conservative advocacy groups in Wisconsin, which in 2011 rallied around Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s push to roll back union rights . That effort was driven in part by groups with ties to billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, and major donors began telling Russo that a similar effort was needed in the Golden State. \u201cIt started with just a kernel of, \u2018Hey, we should be trying to figure out how we create a voice in California,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Russo told investigators. \u201cAnd the Koch model was the model that they were encouraging.\u201d Russo, who works closely with the business community, developed the plan with Jeff Miller, a fundraiser who once headed the finance operations for the state Republican Party and former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Their goal was to raise at least $50\u00a0million to fight Proposition 30, a temporary tax-hike measure Brown was pushing, and support Proposition 32, which would bar unions and corporations from using payroll deductions to raise money for political campaigns. Half of the money would be dedicated to issue ads, which do not require donor disclosure. Russo and Miller, who ended up bringing in $74\u00a0million, were not charged and cooperated with investigators after receiving criminal immunity. They declined to comment for this article.\n \nThe two men told prosecutors that they enlisted the help of Stephen DeMaura, president of Americans for Job Security (AJS ), a nonprofit group registered in Virginia, who was willing to run the issue ads and take on California\u2019s powerful unions. Noble, who Russo said he met through a Koch donor, also pitched in, hiring pollster Frank Luntz to conduct focus groups for the campaign and paying veteran GOP admaker Larry McCarthy to cut possible TV spots. Noble did not respond to requests for comment. By the fall of 2012, Russo and Miller had about $25\u00a0million available for the issue ad campaign. But the money had come in later than they had hoped, and DeMaura worried that running ads could trigger disclosure requirements that kick in close to Election Day, the Sacramento consultants recalled. \n\n But then a lawyer advising the team raised the idea of swapping funds with other organizations as a way of getting the money back in the state without running afoul of disclosure rules. In California, nonprofit groups that make political donations must disclose any contributions made for that purpose, a requirement they hoped to sidestep if another group gave funds that were not raised for the campaign.   Russo turned to Noble, hoping Noble could arrange a money swap through his group, the Center to Protect Patient Rights (CPPR), a Phoenix-based nonprofit with ties to the Kochs . \u201cThe same money couldn\u2019t come back\u201d into California, Russo explained to investigators. \u201cKoch, our understanding was, had a pretty significant network of groups. So that\u2019s why we went to Sean.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t At the time, Noble was working as a consultant to Koch Industries, a position he held through 2012. But Koch spokesman Robert Tappan said in a statement that the Kochs \u201chad no involvement whatsoever, financial or otherwise, neither directly nor indirectly, on anything to do with Prop. 30 or Prop. 32.\u201d  Tappan said the Kochs were not aware that Noble had agreed to help Russo move money into California. \u201cWhatever Sean Noble did with regard to those issues did not involve us,\u201d he said. \n \u2018A fiasco in our world\u2019 \n \n\n The money swap played out over five weeks in the fall. DeMaura transferred $24.55\u00a0million from his group in Virginia to Noble\u2019s organization. The funds were accompanied with letters noting that the funds\u2019 use was \u201cat the sole discretion of your organization.\u201d Noble then dispersed similar amounts to two other nonprofit groups: the American Future Fund in Des Moines and Americans for Responsible Leadership in Phoenix. In California, Joel Fox, the president of the Small Business Action Committee, a political committee running ads about the two ballot initiatives, heard from an excited Russo. \u201cHe said he was working on a big donation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Fox said in an interview. Fox said his group did not know the money would be coming from Americans for Responsible Leadership until a few days before a wire transfer for $11\u00a0million arrived Oct. 15. The committee received assurances from a lawyer working with Noble that it was legitimate, according to Russo. But the large sum from an obscure, out-of-state group caught the attention of Common Cause, an organization that advocates for more transparency in campaign finance. It filed a complaint Oct. 19 with the state\u2019s Fair Political Practices Commission, and Brown used the case to decry \u201cmoney laundering\u201d by \u201cshadowy forces\u201d working against him. As the commission pressed the Arizona group to reveal its donors, Noble told Russo in late October that he couldn\u2019t deliver the final $10\u00a0million needed in California, and he warned that he would point to AJS if investigators sought to trace the source of the funds. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t tolerate an audit of CPPR,\u201d Russo recalled Noble telling him. Two days before the Nov. 6 election, the California Supreme Court ordered Americans for Responsible Leadership to reveal the source of its contribution. It named Noble\u2019s group, which in turned pointed the finger at AJS in Virginia. The Sacramento consultants were furious. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a fiasco in our world,\u201d Miller told investigators. Russo said he was \u201cshocked,\u201d saying he believed AJS funds had been diverted elsewhere in Noble\u2019s network. After a year-long investigation, the commission and the attorney general\u2019s office absolved the Virginia nonprofit of wrongdoing but fined Noble\u2019s organization and Americans for Responsible Leadership a combined $1\u00a0million, a record in the state. It also ordered the two state political committees that spent the funds routed through CPPR to pay the state $15 million. \nFox was stunned. \u201cWe cooperated with this inquiry from the beginning and were told by the attorney general\u2019s office we were clean,\u201d he said. Besides, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t have $11\u00a0million sitting around.\u201d Kirk Adams, president of Americans for Responsible Leadership, said in a statement that the group was pleased the matter was resolved but declined to comment on the state\u2019s findings regarding other groups. As for AJS, DeMaura said that it \u201cconsistently worked within the law\u201d and added that the controversy had not hurt its fundraising. \u201cOur membership continues to grow,\u201d he said in a statement. One lingering mystery is the $10\u00a0million that never made it to California after Russo\u2019s team transferred it to Noble\u2019s operation. Toward the end of Russo\u2019s interview with investigators, a state prosecutor asked whether he felt guilty that money he got from donors did not go where it was intended. \u201cWell, I mean, I felt bad, but, at the same time, you do your best with the facts that you have at the time,\u201d Russo replied, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to break any laws.\u201d", "topics": [], "author": "Matea Gold and Tom Hamburger", "wordCount": 1787}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In upper-crust Washington, former pals fight bitterly over the profitable Headfirst Baseball", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334decf4/sc/13/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clocal0Cin0Eupper0Ecrust0Ewashington0Eformer0Epals0Efight0Ebitterly0Eover0Ethe0Eprofitable0Eheadfirst0Ebaseball0C20A130C110C0A40C5b566d620E424d0E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "They began their 25-year friendship playing youth baseball in upper-crust Washington, a land of neatly manicured outfields and powerful parents in the bleachers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Brendan Sullivan III and Rob Elwood were Little League all-star teammates. They were high school baseball stars at St. Albans School. Now baseball is tearing them apart. In a series of bitter lawsuits that have transfixed Washington\u2019s \u00adprivate-school crowd, the former teammates are feuding over Headfirst Baseball, the District company they built into a multimillion-dollar enterprise of pricey baseball showcases for high school players that college coaches attend and $425-a-week summer sports camps held at St. Albans in Northwest Washington and Mater Dei School in Bethesda. Sullivan, whose father is famed Williams & Connolly attorney Brendan Sullivan Jr. , accuses Elwood, whose mother is D.C. director of protocol and international affairs Patricia Elwood, of ripping off the firm of more than $500,000 to pay for hardwood floors, European closets, a 55-inch TV, trips to the Cayman Islands, massages, maid service and at least one \u201chigh end vacuum cleaner.\u201d Elwood isn\u2019t denying the purchases, saying Sullivan spent the same way and that they agreed it was okay. What the allegations are really about, Elwood says in court papers, is Sullivan\u2019s efforts to get rid of him just as a potential acquirer \u2014 run by a New York hedge fund titan \u2014 offered $5.5\u00a0million for the company. Elwood had been fighting for equity in the company. Sullivan, by dint of his blood ties to a litigator who has represented Iran-contra figure Oliver North, former \n senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and other high-profile clients, is coming at Elwood with high fastballs . At a hearing in U.S. District Court late last month, a parade of seven lawyers marched in from Williams & Connolly, which appears to be representing the younger Sullivan for free. In court papers, the firm\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly called Elwood a thief. \u201cTo avoid responsibility for years of theft,\u201d they write, \u201cElwood spins a fantastic, self-contradictory tale.\u201d They add, \u201cApparently Elwood thought he was entitled to live as a millionaire.\u201d Elwood\u2019s three attorneys have fired back, saying, \u201cSullivan himself authorized, was a participant in, and was the architect of the very conduct he now alleges is wrongful.\u201d They introduced into evidence an iPhone picture of two bags of equally split cash from a Nationals game event \u2014 one for Sullivan, one for Elwood. The vitriol escalates with every legal maneuver. One recent court filing included a letter that the elder Sullivan wrote to one of Elwood\u2019s attorneys, refuting Elwood\u2019s claims that his former teammate used Headfirst funds to procure an engagement ring. \u201cYou bought a lie, hook, line and sinker,\u201d Sullivan Jr. wrote. \u201cYour client lied to you. And, he knows he lied. Your client was so desperate and panicked that he will say anything to make his long-term, repeated conduct less repulsive.\u201d The main asset in this personal and professional divorce is a thriving, highly profitable sports business. It materialized thanks to the win-at-all-costs spending that characterizes youth sports, a $5 billion industry, according to Mark Hyman, a George Washington University professor of sports management and the author of \u201c The Most Expensive Game in Town : The Rising Cost of Youth Sports and the Toll on Today\u2019s Families.\u201d   In the richer corners of the Washington region, parents often view sports as a potential career path for their children, either as professional athletes or through college scholarships, and spend lavishly on equipment, travel teams, private coaching, camps and showcases. Headfirst became a deep reservoir for those aspirations and dollars. By the time they parted ways, Sullivan, 38, and Elwood, 40, were living handsomely on salaries of several hundred thousand dollars a year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Top-notch camps \n In happier times, there was a picture on Headfirst\u2019s Web site of Elwood and Sullivan sitting next to each other in bright red shirts, smiling. \u201cWashington, DC natives and childhood friends Rob Elwood and Brendan Sullivan started Headfirst in 1996 with the vision of providing top-notch sports and summer camp programs for kids in the Washington, DC area,\u201d their biography on the Web site said. \u201cRob and Brendan first met when playing on the same Little League team in 1984, and have been close friends ever since.\u201d The duo included a picture of themselves on that scrappy-looking Little League team \u2014 Elwood skinny with wavy hair, Sullivan a little thicker with a sweet grin. \u201cAfter attending St. Albans School and playing on multiple teams together, Rob went on to play football and baseball at Amherst College, while Brendan headed off to Stanford University and pitched on the Cardinal baseball team. After college, Brendan was drafted and played with the San Diego Padres organization , while Rob worked in the Operations Department of both the Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians.\u201d Both pictures \u2014 and the history they jointly told on the Web site \u2014 have been scrubbed from digital history. The page is included as evidence in the federal case. (There is a separate lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court.) About 8,500 children attended Headfirst\u2019s camps in 2012, according to court papers, which depict the company\u2019s annual revenue at about $5 million. Headfirst summer sports camps are some of the most popular \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 camps in the region. Sports Illustrated for Kids has ranked Headfirst as one of the top 50 in the country and the District\u2019s best summer camp. The company also runs summer camps for professional baseball teams, including the Red Sox, Cubs and Yankees. Headfirst has a separate business aimed at high school baseball players. It\u2019s Honor Roll baseball showcases feature dozens of coaches from elite colleges who scout players paying $995 for two days of action. \n \n\n\nElwood was the operations guru for Headfirst, serving as chief executive and handling the money. Sullivan was the public face of the company. On paper, Sullivan owned the key parts of the sprawling enterprise with his brother Ted. While Elwood and Sullivan shared equal salaries, according to court papers, they did not share equal equity \u2014 a source of frustration to Elwood in late 2012 when the trouble started. Sullivan, in court papers, says the company\u2019s bookkeeper informed him one November day that his paycheck would be short. Sullivan was shocked. He asked why. The bookkeeper said that Elwood, who had been authorized to take $200,000 for a loan, had taken an additional $400,000 without approval.   \u201cSullivan demanded that Elwood return all the borrowed funds and began to inspect the books,\u201d court papers say, noting Elwood did return the unapproved loans. \u201cThe massive scope of Elwood\u2019s serial thefts was then discovered.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t In one instance, court papers say, Sullivan discovered six credit charges for as much as $4,420 to a company called Universal Floors. \u201cElwood explained in the Company\u2019s books and records that these costs were \u2018Equipment Expense \u2014 Summer Camp.\u2019 In fact, these Headfirst funds paid for a hardwood floor in Elwood\u2019s home\u201d in the District, court papers allege. (He now lives in Annapolis with his wife, Stacey, who is also named in one of the lawsuits.) Sullivan alleges that he found hundreds of thousands of dollars of personal expenditures, including bank branch withdrawals of more than $40,000 to pay for \u201cumpires.\u201d When Sullivan confronted Elwood over the spending, court papers say, Elwood didn\u2019t reply for several days. He finally answered by saying he would return $112,000. Sullivan fired him on New Year\u2019s Eve. Elwood has a novel defense, which his lead attorney, J. Douglas Baldridge of Venable LLP, neatly summarized in a recent hearing in front of U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, a prominent jurist who has some recent experience with baseball cases, having presided over the perjury trial of former Major League pitcher Roger Clemens . \u201cIf they\u2019re going to say we stole, we\u2019re going to say we\u2019re an owner,\u201d Baldridge said. \u201cYou can\u2019t steal from yourself.\u201d His theory is that under District laws, where the overall enterprise was formed, Sullivan and Elwood were actually, by definition, partners. And because they were partners, Elwood was entitled to spend the money, which he says Sullivan did, too, as per an established understanding. Elwood\u2019s legal team contends Sullivan spent $38,000 of Headfirst funds to renovate his house in Northwest and $60,000 on personal travel, including attending a Tim McGraw concert in Nashville. Sullivan denies Elwood\u2019s accusations, saying in a written statement, \u201cThe financial transactions that I discovered in December 2012 were not the standard practice of the Headfirst companies, and were unknown to me.\u201d What really happened, Elwood\u2019s lawyers say in court papers, is that Sullivan had been \u201cplotting to remove Elwood from the company\u201d after becoming aware that Steel-Excel, a sports business investment firm controlled by New York hedge fund titan Warren Lichtenstein, had offered $5.5 million for Headfirst \u2014 a transaction eventually turned down, court papers says, because Sullivan thought the company was worth more like $20 million. There are other accusations from both sides in what has become a Ping-Pong match of allegations. Elwood has accused Sullivan of shorting their alma mater, St. Albans, on profit-sharing payments for summer camp. (Sullivan denies the claim.) Sullivan has accused Elwood of interfering with Headfirst\u2019s business after being terminated, including changing Internet passwords. (Elwood denies the claim.) Elwood has accused Sullivan of trying to retroactively cut off Elwood\u2019s health insurance just as his wife was embarking on complicated medical procedures. (Sullivan denies the claim.)   The tightknit St. Albans community has recoiled and disappeared. Nearly two dozen classmates of Sullivan and Elwood didn\u2019t return requests for comment or flatly said no. \u201cI would prefer not to comment on any aspect of this story,\u201d said Dave Baad, their former baseball coach at the school. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t One former St. Albans official did talk \u2014 Oliver \u201cSkip\u201d Grant, the legendary retired athletic director. He was stunned to hear Elwood and Sullivan were feuding. \u201cI remember them being extraordinary young men and superb athletes,\u201d Grant said. \u201cI have the highest regard for both of them.\u201d \n A big-name guy \n If settlement talks are underway, neither side is saying. The case appears headed for trial, a high-stakes showdown that could affect the future of Headfirst\u2019s growing business. Sullivan wants more than $550,000 in compensatory damages, among other demands. Elwood, in a countersuit, wants more than $10 million in compensatory damages and a \u201cdeclaratory judgment of the legal existence of the Headfirst Partnership and Elwood\u2019s rights as a partner and 50% owner therein.\u201d The question for Sullivan is whether his father\u2019s law firm would represent him if the case goes to trial. In court filings, Elwood\u2019s legal team has accused Williams & Connolly lawyers of a \u201cblitzkrieg,\u201d saying they have asked to depose about 100 people and issued more than 100 requests for documents. (Williams & Connolly represents The Washington Post in some legal matters.) \u201cSullivan\u2019s discovery strategy would be comical if it were not made possible through an abuse of power and privilege and ran the very real potential of depriving Elwood of his right to have this dispute resolved on its true merits,\u201d Elwood\u2019s legal team wrote. Elwood is paying for his defense and is facing, as his legal team put it, a \u201cwar of attrition,\u201d putting a fair trial in jeopardy. \u201cIf Sullivan is permitted to exploit his privileged status and financial resources in this fashion, that will never happen and the case likely will crater under its own weight without the proverbial \u2018day in court\u2019 to which Elwood is entitled ever taking place.\u201d Elwood is also arguing Williams & Connolly should be disqualified because the firm, Sullivan\u2019s father and a former partner there had been advising Headfirst for years, presenting a conflict of interest, given Elwood\u2019s contention that he was, in fact, a partner in the company. The judge heard arguments about the firm\u2019s representation of Sullivan last week. At one point, Williams & Connolly lawyer Michael S. Sundermeyer referred to Sullivan\u2019s father as \u201cBig Brendan,\u201d saying that if Elwood\u2019s legal team was pondering putting him on the stand and expecting to elicit testimony detrimental to his own son, that could only be described as a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d Baldridge replied: \u201cI\u2019m just a guy. He\u2019s just a guy with a big name.\u201d After Baldridge presented legal arguments around the disqualification issue, Sundermeyer offered his assessment of their validity: \u201cWe disagree with basically everything they said.\u201d \n Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report.", "topics": [], "author": "Michael S.

They claim federal law requires them to be compensated for the time they spend putting on protective gear before reporting to their work stations. U.S. Steel said the workers need not be paid because of an exception in the law that allows employers and unions to agree not to pay for \u201cany time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday.\u201d Such an agreement is in place in Gary. While washing is not part of the dispute, what constitutes \u201cclothes\u201d is at the heart of the matter. Sandifer\u2019s attorney, Eric Schnapper of Seattle, said that \u201cnot everything an individual wears is clothes.\u201d He said it should not be difficult to differentiate between normal clothes and something unique that industrial workers must don and doff. \u201cOur test is: An item is not clothes if it is worn to protect against a workplace hazard and was designed to protect against hazards,\u201d he told the justices. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit didn\u2019t accept that and previously ruled against the workers, who are required to\u00a0wear flame-retardant jackets, pants, snood, gloves, wristlets and leggings. That court took a picture of a model wearing the attire, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held it up for Schnapper. \u201cFrom the picture, that looks like clothes to me,\u201d she said. Schnapper said this is a case in which a picture does not tell the story. But Ginsburg said there were all kinds of jobs that require uniforms \u2014 bakers or doormen, for instance \u2014 and no one believes those workers should be paid for putting on clothing. And there was a bit of real-life experience from the court. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who worked summers in a steel plant to help pay for college, said there were particularly thick blue jeans that workers would wear at the plant but not elsewhere. Don\u2019t those protect from workplace hazards? he asked. Lawyer Lawrence DiNardo, representing the steel company, said that the focus should be not on the items a worker wears but rather on the process of getting ready for work. \u201cCollective bargaining does not focus on whether or not a shirt is clothes or a pair of pants are clothes or protective eye gear, and that is how the statute was written,\u201d DiNardo said. \u201cGiven those two points, the term \u2018clothes\u2019 as used in the statute was intended to encompass the work outfit industrial workers were required to change into and out of to be ready for work. \u201c Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that would make something like a scuba tank \u201cclothes\u201d for some workers. And she had other examples: \u201cYour definition would include somebody spending an hour of putting on a suit of armor if he\u2019s going to be a jouster. It would include the space people who put on that complicated white suit that has all the connections to equipment.\u201d The government proposed that the court differentiate between clothes and equipment. \u201cFor instance,\u201d said Assistant Solicitor General Anthony A. Yang, \u201cthe meatpacker might have a chain mail\u201d kind of sleeve, chain-mail gloves and a plexiglass \u201cbelly guard\u201d as part of his work attire. Those would not be considered \u201cclothes,\u201d he said. Interest groups representing manufacturers and others said a ruling in favor of the workers could have a huge impact in back pay and other costs. At the end of the hour-long argument, Justice Elena Kagan wondered why a government agency had never tackled the question of what the statute means when it says \u201cclothes.\u201d Schnapper said he did not know, but Justice Antonin Scalia offered a reason. \u201cToo complicated is why,\u201d he said.

The Saudi man had been killed in fighting, and his corpse, with its beatific smile, was photographed and displayed in a Twitter posting inviting others to celebrate his martyrdom. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cHe always used to say: \u2018Those martyrs smile. What is it they see?\u2019\u00a0\u201d a former comrade wrote in a tribute to the fighter, identified as Abu Hamad al-Saya\u2019ri. In another post, an admirer mused about the good fortune of the fallen and speculated on what the dead must be saying: \u201cCongrats to me, congrats to me, I became a martyr.\u201d The Saudi fighter is one of hundreds of Islamist veterans of the Syrian conflict whose deaths are heralded in Web postings, many of which feature bloody \u2014 and, occasionally, smiling \u2014 portraits of the newly deceased . Although the images may strike many Westerners as macabre, they have become one of the rites of service among Syrian jihadists, as well as a popular recruiting tool. \u201cThese guys are celebrated, and to young people back in the neighborhoods, they are heroes,\u201d said Steven Stalinsky , executive director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washington nonprofit group that monitors Web sites and news media in the region. \u201cThey look at the photos and they say, \u2018I can be this guy.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The memorials for dead fighters are but one manifestation of an explosion in the use of social media by Islamists since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. Although jihadists have long used the Internet to communicate messages from leaders or spread images of battle, Syrian rebel groups are flocking to Web sites such as Twitter, Instagram and Flickr to create new ways to recruit, train, raise money, debate theology and coordinate strategy, researchers say. To some Syrian rebels and their supporters, Twitter is not just a communications tool but also an online cash machine, useful for soliciting donations or even running auctions for donated cars and jewelry. Others use Skype accounts to conduct interviews with potential recruits or to share advice on military tactics. Still others employ YouTube or Facebook to trumpet their battlefield successes or to document alleged atrocities by their opponents. The sites\u2019 growing popularity among the more extremist Syrian rebel groups \u2014 including some with ties to al-Qaeda \u2014 has prompted calls for more stringent policing by the U.S. companies that own them. A handful of accounts have been blocked, but the vast majority continue to operate, providing a rare window into the thinking, planning and tactics of jihadist groups in Syria and beyond, analysts say. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting in the age of Twitter is that the normal jihadi cultural material \u2014 previously confined to private discussion forums \u2014 is being broadcast more widely where everyone can see it,\u201d said William McCants, a Brookings Institution scholar who studies the Islamists\u2019 use of the Internet. \u201cThe closed jihadi community is coming out into the light of day and inviting others to join.\u201d  \n Tributes, testimonials \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Among the most striking features of the Syrian conflict is the profusion of social-media postings devoted to individual fighters, both living and dead. Since the arrival of the first foreign jihadists in Syria more than two years ago, rebel volunteers have used Facebook and Twitter accounts to keep their friends and relatives updated about their experiences, just as U.S. troops stationed in war zones do. When fighters are killed, the same Web sites offer a way to spread the news to family and friends and pay tribute to the fallen, researchers say. With flowery language and photographs that sometimes border on ghoulish, the online tributes seek to reinforce the Islamist belief in martyrdom as a high calling \u2014 a noble death that guarantees a place in paradise. Last year, Stalinsky\u2019s group began to catalogue the \u201cmartyrdom\u201d tributes showing up on Facebook and Twitter. But a year later, Stalinsky said, there were so many postings that the organization could not keep up. Many of the postings include images and allusions intended to resonate with the Muslim faithful. In some photos, bodies with grievous wounds are posed so that they appear to be smiling or, in some cases, pointing to heaven. Dead rebels with wide, toothy grins elicit admiring comments, as was the case when the image of a lightly bearded youth was displayed on a Twitter account in April. \u201cWe have seen many martyrs smiling when they meet with their God, but we haven\u2019t seen a smile this wide,\u201d responded a man writing under the Twitter name FahadJabbar1. \u201cWhat did he see to make this beautiful smile? Oh Allah, grant us martyrdom.\u201d A common belief among jihadists is that martyrdom brings special rewards in paradise, including the affections of 72 \u201chouris\u201d \u2014 black-eyed virgins promised to men in the afterlife \u2014 as well as an ability to win entry to heaven for the martyr\u2019s relatives. Jihadist teaching also holds that the martyr\u2019s corpse resists decay and exudes a perfume-like smell. Thus, many of the photos of the dead are accompanied by testimonials claiming that the bodies possessed an otherworldly aura. \n\n \n \u201cThe scent of musk emanated from his pure body, and it was smelled by the mujahideen,\u201d Twitter member Albaraibnmalik1 said of a dead fighter whose smiling, bearded face was featured in an online posting in March. \u201cWomen trilled loudly after they smelled the musk emanating from his body.\u201d \n Propaganda mechanism \n Until recently, when a terrorist leader such as Osama bin Laden sought to convey a message , he would send videotapes via couriers to trusted assistants who would post them on Islamic Web sites \u2014 a process involving delays of several days or even weeks. By contrast, rebel commanders in Syria have instant access to thousands of followers. Groups in Kuwait that support the Syrian rebels have used Twitter to run increasingly elaborate fundraising drives , including online auctions that accept cash bids for donated luxury goods, including Land Rover SUVs, diamond necklaces and resort properties. Others use social networking sites to distribute not only resources but also ideas. Some of Syria\u2019s larger rebel groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra, an Islamist faction linked to al-Qaeda, use Twitter and Facebook in much the same way that corporations and government agencies in the United States do. The groups run sophisticated media outreach programs that allow them to better manage their public image, said Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group , a private company that monitors jihadists\u2019 Web postings. Jabhat al-Nusra, which has been labeled a terrorist organization by the Obama administration, has sought to counter that image with an aggressive social-media campaign that seeks to cast the group in a softer light, Katz said. Some recent postings on YouTube showed Jabhat al-Nusra fighters handing out food and blankets or clearing trash from rubble-strewn Syrian neighborhoods. \u201cClearly this new style of media propaganda is very different from the old fighting images affiliated with the jihadist outlets,\u201d Katz said. Such efforts reflect an ambition to \u201cwin hearts and minds of the local population as well as the international community,\u201d she said. Such messaging depends on services and networks run by U.S. firms. Twitter, a San \u00adFrancisco-based company, is the preferred platform for many of the groups in Syria. It is also regularly used by top al-Qaeda terrorists, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, the group\u2019s leader since the death of bin Laden. Twitter in recent months has taken steps to shut down a number of accounts linked to known terrorists, but company officials have said that they lack the resources to monitor the estimated 500 million registered users and 340 million messages posted on a typical day. Although attempts to police the sites are laudable, Katz said, \u201cin most cases, they fail to make a significant dent.\u201d", "topics": [], "author": "Joby Warrick", "wordCount": 1270}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Johnson &#38; Johnson agrees to pay $2.2 billion in drug-marketing settlement", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334afe90/sc/3/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cnational0Chealth0Escience0Cjohnson0Eand0Ejohnson0Eagrees0Eto0Epay0E220Ebillion0Ein0Edrug0Emarketing0Esettlement0C20A130C110C0A40Ca70A923420E456a0E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "Johnson & Johnson will pay $2.2\u00a0billion to resolve civil and criminal allegations involving the marketing of off-label, unapproved uses for three prescription drugs, Justice Department officials announced Monday. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The cases, which date from the late 1990s through the early 2000s, involve alleged kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies to promote the antipsychotic drugs Risperdal and Invega, and a heart drug, Natrecor. The widely anticipated agreement was one of the largest health-care fraud settlements in U.S. history.  Federal investigators accused a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary of promoting Risperdal for controlling anxiety and aggression in elderly dementia patients, as well as for treating behavioral problems in other \u201cvulnerable\u201d populations, such as children and the mentally disabled, even though the Food and Drug Administration initially approved the drug only for schizophrenia. Officials said the company also promoted off-label uses for Invega and \u201cmade false and misleading statements about its safety and efficacy.\u201d In addition, Justice officials said another Johnson & Johnson subsidiary undertook an \u201caggressive campaign\u201d to market Natrecor for some patients with less severe heart disease than the drug was designed to treat. Monday\u2019s settlement included criminal fines and forfeited profits of about $485\u00a0million, as well as civil payments to the federal government and various states totaling more than $1.7\u00a0billion, the Justice Department said. \u201cThe conduct at issue in this case jeopardized the health and safety of patients and damaged the public trust,\u201d Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in announcing the settlement. \u201cThis multibillion-dollar resolution demonstrates the Justice Department\u2019s firm commitment to preventing and combating all forms of health-care fraud. And it proves our determination to hold accountable any corporation that breaks the law and enriches its bottom line at the expense of the American people.\u201d The deal also marked the latest in a string of high-profile fraud settlements that the government has sought against the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. The Justice Department said it has recovered nearly $17\u00a0billion since 2009 by bringing cases under the False Claims Act, with about $12\u00a0billion of that involving fraud against federal health-care programs. In the largest settlement, British drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline agreed last year to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay $3\u00a0billion in fines for improperly marketing numerous drugs and not reporting safety data about a diabetes medication. Federal law forbids companies from marketing drugs for uses other than those specifically approved by the FDA, although doctors may prescribe drugs for such off-label uses. \u201cWhen pharmaceutical companies interfere with FDA\u2019s mission of ensuring that drugs are safe and effective for the American public, they undermine the doctor-patient relationship and put the health and safety of patients at risk,\u201d John Roth, director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations, said Monday in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement demonstrates the government\u2019s continued focus on pharmaceutical companies that put profits ahead of the public health.\u201d In addition to the monetary penalties, Johnson & Johnson entered a five-year agreement with the government, requiring the company to change its executive compensation program so it can recoup money from employees who engage in misconduct. The agreement requires the company to submit detailed reports to federal officials about its business operations and any payments to physicians. Associate Attorney General Tony West said such nonmonetary provisions are an effort \u201cto change corporate behavior\u201d rather than to merely impose fines. \u201cIn addition to accountability,\u201d West said, \u201cwe are looking for deterrents.\u201d Johnson & Johnson said it had cooperated with government investigators during years of inquiries about the various allegations. The company said one of its subsidiaries will plead guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for the way it promoted Risperdal. But despite the hefty settlement, Johnson & Johnson said it \u201cexpressly denies the government\u2019s civil allegations.\u201d The company also said that it had previously accrued the settlement amounts, and that no other charge to earnings would be recorded. \u201cToday we reached closure on complex legal matters spanning almost a decade,\u201d Johnson & Johnson general counsel Michael Ullmann said in a statement. \u201cThis resolution allows us to move forward and continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions that improve and enhance the health and well-being of patients around the world.\u201d Monday\u2019s settlement also will result in a significant payout for whistleblowers in three states \u2014 Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and California \u2014 who officials said will receive nearly $168\u00a0million of the government\u2019s take. \n Sari Horwitz contributed to this report.", "topics": [], "author": "Brady Dennis", "wordCount": 723}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "In Alabama election, a showdown between the GOP establishment and the tea party", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334cb562/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Cin0Ealabama0Eelection0Ea0Eshowdown0Ebewteen0Ethe0Egop0Eestablishment0Eand0Ethe0Etea0Eparty0C20A130C110C0A40C7ad9eee20E44ce0E11e30Ebf0Ac0Ecebf37c6f4840Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "ROBERTSDALE, Ala. \u2014 The long-running battle for the heart and soul of the national Republican Party will play out here on Tuesday in the form of a nasty little House special-election primary, pitting business-oriented establishment Republicans against angry and energized tea party insurgents who have become a dominant voice in the GOP. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Dean Young is the insurgents\u2019 candidate. Bradley Byrne is the establishment choice. On Saturday, each made his case to a group of Republicans gathered at Mama Lou\u2019s Restaurant here. When it was his turn, Young waved off the microphone and announced in his baritone drawl that \u201cthe nation is watching.\u201d A Christian conservative aligned with the tea party, Young urged voters to send him to Washington so he can help return the country \u201cto the Constitution and the godly principles that made this nation great.\u201d But the national attention he alluded to has to do with a full-scale effort by the business wing of the GOP to stop him from winning the party\u2019s nomination Tuesday. They prefer Byrne, a mild-mannered lawyer who minutes earlier focused his remarks on health care and the budget. Polls show that the special-election runoff could go either way. The race has become the latest front in the fight for a divided and troubled Republican Party. Stung by the recent government shutdown and debt-ceiling turmoil, business groups are intensifying their efforts to elect like-minded candidates such as Byrne who are disinclined to push the economy to the brink of disaster again. Standing in their way is a grass-roots movement, embodied by Young, that is irate with the federal government and spoiling for another fight, no matter the political costs. \u201cI think the business community is looking at races and at primaries more closely than we have been in the past,\u201d said David French, the chief lobbyist at the National Retail Federation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has endorsed Byrne, a business lawyer and former state senator who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010. The group has spent at least $199,000 on mailers, phone calls and digital media to help him, campaign finance records show. Byrne last month received a flurry of big donations from the political action committees of AT&T, Home Depot, Exxon Mobil and Wal-Mart, to name a few. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s leadership PAC also gave him money. A Byrne victory would lend momentum to an effort by the Republican establishment to wrest control of the GOP from the tea party faction, which has dominated the debate over the past three years. The battle is already on for other seats in 2014, including two in Michigan held by Reps. Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio, tea party favorites who have drawn primary challengers. Retiree Ben Butzbaugh, 69, who plans to vote for Byrne, said he doesn\u2019t want someone who will go to Washington just to be a rabble-rouser: \u201cI hope we don\u2019t send people up there to make a lot of noise and shut down the government.\u201d \n Understated vs. wild card \n An understated man with neatly parted, thinning white hair, Byrne bills himself as a problem-solver who wants to make government work better. At an event last week in the town of Dauphin Island, Byrne called Young a \u201cshow horse\u201d who is interested only in agitation.   \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for somebody who\u2019s just going to go up there and fight, he\u2019s your guy,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cIf you\u2019re searching for somebody who\u2019s going to up there and fight and be effective, I\u2019m your guy.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The son of a truck salesman and a bookkeeper, Byrne, 58, is a former Democrat who made his first foray into public office in the 1990s when he was elected to the State Board of Education. He later served in the state Senate as a Republican and was appointed head of Alabama\u2019s two-year college system in 2007 before running for governor in 2010. He says a seat in Congress would be his last elected position. An advocate of repealing the federal health-care law, Byrne said he did not support the bipartisan Senate compromise to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling because it was \u201ckicking the can down the road.\u201d And he\u2019s noncommittal about backing Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) for another term as House speaker. But he worries about the consequences of shuttering the government, setting him apart from his opponent. \u201cAnybody who tells you it\u2019s a good thing to shut down the federal government, they really don\u2019t understand our whole national system,\u201d he said. Young disagrees. \u201cThe shutdown was not the end of the world,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I said it should still be shut down until we get some real answers and get some real changes in Washington.\u201d A real estate developer who names Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) as his favorite Washington Republicans, Young, 49, says that the federal government needs a \u201ccomplete overhaul\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s almost immoral\u201d to \u201ckeep adding to the deficit.\u201d He is a social conservative who has disparaged Byrne as a product of the GOP establishment and has flatly ruled out supporting Boehner for another term as speaker. He\u2019s also a controversial figure who has earned a reputation as a wild card. His outspoken opposition to same-sex marriage has drawn scrutiny (\u201cI\u2019m against homosexuals pretending like they\u2019re married,\u201d he said in a local TV interview). And his biggest local supporter is state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, known best for his refusal to take down a monument to the Ten Commandments he installed in the court\u2019s building. Young\u2019s volatility may explain why most national tea party groups have steered clear of the race . The anti-tax Club for Growth hasn\u2019t spent any money, nor has FreedomWorks or the Tea Party Express. Alabama Republican strategist Brent Buchanan said the groups probably \u201cdon\u2019t want to be associated\u201d with some of Young\u2019s statements. Despite a dearth of money and national help, Young boasts a key coalition of evangelical Christian supporters, which concerned Byrne\u2019s campaign enough that it ran an ad accusing Young of using Christian donors\u2019 contributions to his PAC for personal gain. Young has also tapped into a base of voters who think Republicans have compromised too often. \u201cThe people I\u2019m talking to here \u2014 and this isn\u2019t just tea party people \u2014 they\u2019re disgusted with Republicans caving in,\u201d said Pete Riehm, a tea party activist who is backing Young. \n \u2018It\u2019s okay to get angry\u2019 \n Alabama\u2019s 1st District, based in Mobile and bounded by the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Mississippi to the west, is safe Republican territory where Mitt Romney won more than six in 10 votes. The winner of Tuesday\u2019s GOP runoff will be a virtual lock to win the Dec. 17 general election. But it\u2019s not a tea party stronghold, strategists say. Jo Bonner, a traditional conservative Republican, represented the district from 2003 until he resigned this year to take a job in the University of Alabama system. Bonner backs Byrne and called him a candidate \u201cin the mold\u201d of all the district\u2019s previous representatives. David Mowery, an Alabama political strategist who has worked with clients of both parties, said, \u201cI think the typical voter in this district is a moderate conservative who values common sense over extremism.\u201d Byrne\u2019s team has been looking to boost turnout in the closing days. The candidate spent Friday evening stumping at a high school football game, encouraging people to show up at the polls. About 52,000 people cast ballots in the September primary election, in which no candidate won a majority. Turnout could be even lighter Tuesday. Undecided voters such as Daniel Scarcliff, who owns a bakery, could hold the key to victory \u2014 not only in the 1st District but in the broader struggle for control of the Republican Party. After listening to Byrne on Dauphin Island, Scarcliff offered the candidate some advice. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to get angry sometimes,\u201d he said.", "topics": [], "author": "Sean Sullivan", "wordCount": 1298}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "A woman\u2019s success damages a male partner\u2019s ego, says a new study", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334cb809/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cnational0Chealth0Escience0Ca0Ewomans0Esuccess0Edamages0Ea0Emale0Epartners0Eego0Esays0Ea0Enew0Estudy0C20A130C110C0A40Cc88f227e0E3c270E11e30Ea94f0Eb580A17bfee6c0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "Does a woman\u2019s success damage the ego of her male partner? Perhaps we\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve evolved beyond that, but a recent study suggests otherwise . In fact, in the study, a woman\u2019s success made her partner feel worse about himself than her failure did. Women in the study were unaffected by their partners\u2019 successes (or failures). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cIt\u2019s a problem that doesn\u2019t get spoken of very much. What man is going to say, \u2018Well, because you are successful, I feel less than\u2019?\u201d said Marion Solomon, a marital therapist in West Los Angeles and co-author of \u201cLove and War in Intimate Relationships .\u201d In the privacy of the therapist\u2019s office, it\u2019s a different story, said Jill Weber, a clinical psychologist in Tysons Corner. \u201cIt\u2019s .\u2009.\u2009. something that certainly clinicians and therapists see a lot.\u201d What makes the new study so fascinating, Weber said, is that the men who participated weren\u2019t even aware that their self-esteem was affected by their partners\u2019 performance. This, she said, could cause problems later on. A man struggling on an unconscious level with a partner\u2019s success might suddenly act out \u2014 distancing himself from his partner, becoming slow to return phone calls or being less attentive, said Weber, author of \u201c Having Sex, Wanting Intimacy: Why Women Settle for One-Sided Relationships .\u201d \u201cMaybe they do things that they don\u2019t understand themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe guy is giving the impression that he\u2019s not that into the relationship, when in reality he\u2019s just trying to protect himself from the fear of rejection.\u201d \n It\u2019s all about competition \n The study\u2019s lead author, Kate A. Ratliff of the University of Florida , attributed the results to a difference in how men and women respond to competition. \u201cOn average, men are more competitive than women,\u201d Ratliff said. \u201cSo it\u2019s definitely possible that men would respond in a self-negative way to anybody\u2019s success.\u201d While it might make sense for a competitive man to feel threatened by being outperformed by a woman, the men in this study felt their partner\u2019s success was their own failure, regardless of whether they were engaged in one-on-one competition. The men in the study, which was conducted in the United States and the Netherlands, also might have been reacting to culturally reinforced expectations of men\u2019s traditional role of dominance in a relationship, a role threatened by female success, Ratliff said. The study involved five experiments in which a total of 896 men and women participated. In one, a person was told that his or her romantic partner had scored in either the top 12 percent or the bottom 12 percent in a problem-solving test; then, the person\u2019s self-esteem, both explicit and implicit, was measured. In the other experiments, participants were asked to write about social or intellectual situations in which a partner had succeeded or failed. While all participants expressed positive feelings about a partner\u2019s success, the researchers determined that on a more subtle level, a man\u2019s self-esteem actually fell after he acknowledged that his partner had done well.   The study, whose results were published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, covered three experiments with college-age subjects and two with people whose average age was around 30. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The findings make sense to the University of Connecticut\u2019s James O\u2019Neil , who studies gender-role conflicts and the psychology of boys and men. \u201cFrom a masculinity perspective, men are supposed to be the ones that succeed, and certainly for some men they think they should succeed more than women and be better than women,\u201d said O\u2019Neil, a professor of educational psychology. \u201cMen are socialized to be competitive and to win and to succeed.\u201d Traditionally, men have been expected to take the lead in a relationship, especially financially, and to be the front-runner, said Aaron Rochlen , a professor who studies the psychology of men and masculinity at the University of Texas at Austin. But increasingly, men are no longer the financial leaders in their relationships. This may not prove to be, as author Hanna Rosin calls it, \u201c The End of Men ,\u201d but Rochlen said that among married heterosexual couples, more women are out-earning their partners than ever. In dual-income families, 28 percent of American wives earn more than their husbands, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data . Many men struggle with that reality, even though they may not admit it. Men who react negatively to a partner\u2019s success, Rochlen said, are probably hanging on to old-school ideas of what it means to be a man \u2014 what Rochlen called \u201cthe John Wayne model of masculinity\u201d that a man should have control over a woman, restrict his emotions, avoid vulnerability and be in command at all times, attitudes that don\u2019t square with living in today\u2019s world or being psychologically healthy. Rochlen said such men are more likely than others to suffer broadly in relationships and beyond. He noted that there\u2019s much research showing that holding on to outdated male stereotypes and behavior is a major predictor of high levels of substance abuse, acting out, depression, anxiety and other problems. That women in the experiments had no problem with a man\u2019s success can be explained in a couple of ways. The study\u2019s authors noted that whereas men are inclined to be competitive, women are more likely to identify with a partner in a nurturing way and therefore less likely to be threatened by her partner\u2019s success. \n Undoing a long history \n Solomon offered a different interpretation: Longtime gender roles may also play a part in a woman\u2019s unfazed positive reaction to a male partner\u2019s success. \u201cWomen had been trained in our culture to see themselves as a support system for the husband. And if he is successful, they are successful. We\u2019ve had 3,000 years of history saying you\u2019re supposed to be with a man who\u2019s a little taller, a little smarter and a little richer. And you can\u2019t change that in one generation.\u201d Rochlen said that as more women rise to power and success supported by husbands or partners whom people admire, this will help modify societal beliefs about men, women and success. In the meantime, how should couples navigate the tender subject of self-esteem and partner success? Solomon suggests that a man who\u2019s feeling ill at ease over a partner\u2019s success needs reassurance of his or her worth. She said back before the women\u2019s movement, the smartest men were the ones who made sure to acknowledge the importance of the woman behind the man. The same applies today to men with successful female partners. \u201cWhat you want to do, no matter how successful you are \u2014 and I say this to women and to men \u2014 [is] make sure that the person you are committed to knows that you feel very fortunate to be with them, \u201d Solomon said. \u201cTell them, \u2018Here are the things I appreciate about you.\u2019\u2009\u201d \n Allard Levingston is a writer based in Bethesda.", "topics": [], "author": "Suzanne Allard Levingston", "wordCount": 1122}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Biden rallies Democrats, Rubio and Paul aid GOP on the eve of Virginia governor election", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334d5842/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clocal0Cvirginia0Epolitics0Cbiden0Erubio0Eand0Epaul0Eto0Elend0Ea0Ehand0Eon0Eeve0Eof0Eelection0Ein0Evirginia0Egovernors0Erace0C20A130C110C0A40C3db257be0E4250A0E11e30Ea6240E41d661b0Abb780Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli II spent their final day on the campaign trail before polls open across Virginia making virtually the same argument: that the governor\u2019s race offers a stark choice with grave consequences for the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t McAuliffe sought to hold onto a lead reflected in all recent polls, appearing with Vice President Biden in Fairfax County and urging Democrats to do what many Virginians skip in off-year elections: vote. Cuccinelli joined conservative stars Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former representative Ron Paul of Texas in a final push to motivate his base by tying McAuliffe to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act. Biden told Democrats gathered in Annandale that McAuliffe would beat back a tea party movement that \u201cis antithetical to everything this great state has been known for throughout its history.\u201d Rubio urged Republicans at a pair of rallies to back Cuccinelli and send this message: \u201cWe don\u2019t want Obamacare. We don\u2019t want more big government.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s election was expected to be widely watched as a window into Virginia\u2019s continuing political evolution into a hotly contested swing state. While Obama won the state in both 2008 and 2012, the state\u2019s congressional delegation, governor\u2019s office and House of Delegates are controlled by Republicans. In off-years such as this one, Democrats typically struggle to turn out some of the voters who helped push Obama to victory, notably young and nonwhite residents. Biden\u2019s appearance, less than 24 hours before polls were set to open and one day after Obama headlined another rally in nearby Arlington County, was a direct effort to change that pattern. Their combined firepower also signifies the importance that national Democrats are putting on the race as a test of the party\u2019s message ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections. A crowd of roughly 300 Democrats waited in sub-40-degree weather in the back yard of Alex Rodriguez, an Annandale businessman and party activist, to hear Biden and McAuliffe before heading out to knock on doors across Northern Virginia. \u201cThis is a choice between the mainstream and the extreme,\u201d Biden said, echoing Obama\u2019s rhetoric from Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s what this race is about.\u201d Forty miles west, Rubio told the few hundred people gathered in the Stoneridge Events Center in Warrenton that Tuesday\u2019s election is the first chance for voters to issue a referendum on the new health-care law. \u201cThis race \u2014 not just for governor, but right down the ballot \u2014 gives you an opportunity to choose between two very different visions about how we can make Virginia and America a place where anyone from anywhere can accomplish anything,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cNow, what do they stand for? What do the Democrats in this race stand for? They stand for the same failed policies that have never worked anywhere they\u2019ve ever been tried and won\u2019t work here.\u201d By the time Cuccinelli reached the Warrenton reception hall, his voice was starting to go hoarse as he again gave a speech that ridiculed the health-care law and urged the crowd to knock on doors and ask their friends, neighbors and co-workers to vote Tuesday. But the jokes he had made before \u2014 suggesting that he might change the rules for daylight saving time and making fun of the government\u2019s attempts to build functioning health-care Web sites \u2014 still incited roars of laughter and applause.   Later Monday, several hundred people gathered in a spacious hall at the Greater Richmond Convention Center for Cuccinelli\u2019s final election-eve rally with Ron Paul and his son, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cBigger government leads you to Terry McAuliffe\u2019s position, and limited government leads you to Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s position,\u201d Cuccinelli told the group. Cuccinelli also took a dig at McAuliffe\u2019s upstate New York accent, saying that McAuliffe keeps promising to create jobs \u00a0-- or \u201cjabs,\u201d as Cuccinelli pronounced it -- without having a real plan to drive the economy. Then, as his wife Teiro joined him onstage cuddling a puppy, Cuccinelli repeated a line he used at their last debate on Oct. 24:\u00a0 \u201cTerry McAuliffe is all puppies and no plans.\u201d Ron Paul, speaking at an almost breathless clip, whipped through a hit parade of libertarian issues: criticizing the Federal Reserve, the 16 th Amendment that allowed the federal government to collect income tax and discussing the 17 th Amendment as a basis for nullification of federal decrees such as Obamacare. He also cited widespread domestic and foreign spying by the National Security Agency as evidence of a federal government that is out of control. Several of the Republican candidates and representatives who spoke Monday tried to appeal to minority voters. Rubio gave a short address in Spanish. And E.W. Jackson, the Chesapeake minister who is running for lieutenant governor and doesn\u2019t often attend events with Cuccinelli, said that Republican candidates have been misrepresented in the media. \u201cWe want to serve every Virginian, no matter the color of their skin,\u201d Jackson said, as about a dozen \u201cJackson\u201d signs waved in the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ve been reaching out to those black Virginians, Hispanic Virginians, Asian Virginians, Indian Virginians and telling them: You\u2019ve been lied to. You\u2019ve been told we don\u2019t care about you. There\u2019s a difference between us and them. For them, you are pawns on their political chessboard.\u201d Lillian Reed, 69, attended the rally with her husband, both dressed in shirts that featured the Constitution and red, white and blue hats. \u201cThat was awesome,\u201d Reed, who lives in Warrenton, said as the event ended. \u201cHe\u2019s a constitutionalist. He\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s going to send a message to this country. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m just praying that America wakes up.\u201d In Culpeper, Cuccinelli told a crowd of several hundred people that the race is close and could be won by just a few hundred votes. He pointed out that in his previous four races \u2014 three for the state\u2019s General Assembly and one for attorney general \u2014 he has been outspent by his opponent and still won. \u201cIf we win tomorrow by a small number of votes, I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Cuccinelli said Monday. \n\n After Annandale, McAuliffe traveled to a shopping center in suburban Richmond to rally supporters at a campaign office. Accompanied by two former Democratic governors \u2014 Sens. Mark R. Warner and Timothy M. Kaine \u2014 McAuliffe said he would work across party lines but also indicated he would not compromise on abortion rights. \u201cI will be a brick wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI trust women to make their own decisions on their own personal health choices. I will be a brick wall on those issues.\u201d Warner revved up the crowd with, \u201cYou all ready to win?\u201d Kaine noted that he and Warner would have to head to Washington right after the event so they could vote on a measure to protect gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination. \u201cIt is good to stand together with a ticket that I can support with the complete knowledge that they view that \u2014 equality, fairness, the right treatment of people, anti-discrimination \u2014 as a core value not only personally, but a core value of what the commonwealth of Virginia stands for,\u201d Kaine said, giving a nod to the other statewide Democratic candidates present, state Sen. Ralph S. Northam of Norfolk, who is running for lieutenant governor, and state Sen. Mark R. Herring of Loudoun, who is running for attorney general. The last day before polls open began with the release of what will likely be the final independent survey of the race. A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday shows McAuliffe at 46 percent, Cuccinelli at 40 percent and Libertarian Robert Sarvis at 8 percent among likely voters. The previous Quinnipiac survey of the race, released last week, showed McAuliffe ahead by 4 points, leading Cuccinelli and his allies to argue that the race was tightening. But other polls have shown larger leads \u2014 the last Washington Post poll had McAuliffe ahead 12 points \u2014 and the vast majority of surveys taken in the past couple of months have put the Democrat ahead between 5 and 9 points. \n\n As in other polls, McAuliffe enjoys a significant lead among women \u2014 14 points \u2014 while Cuccinelli\u2019s popularity numbers are upside down: The Republican has a 38 percent favorable, 52 percent unfavorable rating. McAuliffe\u2019s score is 42-45. \n Laura Vozzella in Richmond contributed to this report.", "topics": [], "author": "Ben Pershing and Jenna Johnson", "wordCount": 1359}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "NBC News, agreeing to pay for sky-diving footage, criticized for \u2018checkbook journalism\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334b9f72/sc/8/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Clifestyle0Cstyle0Cnbc0Enews0Eto0Epay0Efor0Eskydivers0Eaccount0Eof0Eair0Eaccident0C20A130C110C0A40C0A8b1c44a0E458f0E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "In a second episode of apparent \u201ccheckbook journalism\u201d in a week, NBC News has locked up exclusive interviews and amateur footage of an aerial accident with a six-figure fee to a group of sky divers who survived the collision of their two small planes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t NBC\u2019s news division has agreed to compensate the nine sky divers and two pilots who were involved in the accident for an appearance on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, a story on \u201cNBC Nightly News With Brian Williams\u201d and a one-hour \u201cDateline NBC\u201d special. The deal involves TV interviews and footage of the stricken planes taken by some of the sky divers\u2019 helmet cameras, according to Mike Robinson, a sky-diving instructor who was involved in the incident near Lake Superior in northwest Wisconsin. \u201cNBC has the exclusive right,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWe can do print and radio interviews, but no TV interviews [other than for NBC] for two weeks. That\u2019s the agreement.\u201d Individuals with the network said the group will receive in excess of $100,000 for their participation. NBC would not confirm that figure, but the network said it paid only for use of the video. NBC said other news organizations were also bidding for the material. Mainstream news organizations typically frown on paying sources , lest the payments taint the sources\u2019 veracity or color the news outlet\u2019s objectivity in reporting the story. Although some news organizations, such as the National Enquirer and TMZ.com, pay for news, checkbook journalism is considered unethical by the Society of Professional Journalists and other professional news organizations. NBC News\u2019s agreement with the sky divers follows last week\u2019s disclosure that the news division is negotiating an exclusive documentary deal, reportedly for more than $100,000, with the family of Hannah Anderson, the teenage girl who was kidnapped this summer by a family friend who had murdered her mother and brother. Anderson, who survived her ordeal, already has appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cDateline NBC\u201d in a series of exclusive interviews with the network. The two deals signal a more aggressive approach to securing ratings-grabbing exclusives by Deborah Turness, NBC News\u2019s new president. Turness joined the network in August from ITV News, Britain\u2019s leading commercial TV network. NBC News is under pressure to restore the ratings dominance of the \u201cToday\u201d show, which has fallen behind its ABC rival, \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d in the lucrative morning-news period. The two programs compete ferociously to book newsworthy guests, particularly those with a strong appeal to women, who comprise the majority of viewers for both shows. The competition has led to bidding wars for of-the-moment interview subjects in the past, although ABC News said it has banned the practice of paying for interviews. In a statement, NBC News spokeswoman Ali Zelenko said, \u201cNBC News is proud to have this remarkable footage of human survival for use across all of our platforms and broadcasts, including an hour-long \u2018Dateline\u2019 special. Our licensing of this footage is standard industry practice and is the result of a very competitive process with other major broadcast outlets.\u201d Robinson said that interviews with the participants also were part of the agreement with NBC News. ABC News said it was involved in the bidding for the video, but it pulled out \u201cas soon as it became clear that these interviews were tied directly to cash payments,\u201d spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said. Paying for interviews \u201cis a clear violation of our standards and ethics. We wanted to bid solely for the rights to the footage.\u201d The sky-diving video may be particularly valuable because the story occurred during a \u201csweeps\u201d month in television, one of four quarterly periods in which ratings are used as a benchmark by local stations to set advertising rates for non-sweeps periods. TV stations typically promote their news programs heavily during sweeps months such as November and February in order to drive up viewership. Robinson, 64, and three sky divers were seconds away from leaping out of a Cessna airplane for their final sky-dive of the day Saturday when a plane carrying another group of sky divers hit the top of their plane. Robinson\u2019s plane burst into flames and began to break apart as the sky divers leapt from it. The pilot of their plane ejected and used an emergency parachute to land safely as the plane spiraled downward and showered the falling divers with debris. The pilot of the second plane, which was damaged, managed to land the plane safely to the airport. None of the nine sky divers and two pilots were seriously injured in the accident, which is under investigation. The dramatic footage, taken from the sky divers\u2019 perspective, hasn\u2019t been seen on TV yet. But, said Robinson, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all of it. It\u2019s pretty dramatic.\u201d", "topics": [], "author": "Paul Farhi", "wordCount": 765}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "The Switch: How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334b1e49/sc/21/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cthe0Eswitch0Cpost0Chow0Ewe0Eknow0Ethe0Ensa0Ehad0Eaccess0Eto0Einternal0Egoogle0Eand0Eyahoo0Ecloud0Edata0C20A130C110C0A40C699d79f0A0E458c0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": [], "author": "Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Early Lead: Sean Taylor verdict: Eric Rivera Jr. guilty of second-degree murder", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334b9aed/sc/11/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cearly0Elead0Cpost0Csean0Etaylor0Everdict0Eeric0Erivera0Ejr0Eguilty0Eof0Esecond0Edegree0Emurder0C20A130C110C0A40C1d0Aa38580E458c0E11e30E95a90E3f15b5618ba80Iblog0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "wpostServer: http://css.washingtonpost.com/wpost", "topics": [], "author": "Cindy Boren", "wordCount": 1}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Holder says his plan to try 9/11 suspects in civilian court in New York was \u2018right one\u2019", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334b9aef/sc/8/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cworld0Cnational0Esecurity0Cholder0Esays0Ehis0Eplan0Eto0Etry0E9110Esuspects0Ein0Ecivilian0Ecourt0Ein0Enew0Eyork0Ewas0Eright0Eone0C20A130C110C0A40C31e942ac0E457b0E11e30Ea1960E3544a0A3c23510Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. appeared to criticize the pace of military commission trials at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying Monday that he was correct four years ago when he attempted to put Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four other suspects on trial in New York for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u201cI think that had we gone along the path that I announced at that time, we would not have had to close down half of Manhattan. It wouldn\u2019t have cost $200\u00a0million a year,\u201d Holder said at a news conference. \u201cAnd the defendants would be on death row as we speak.\u201d Holder announced the plan to try Mohammed and the other defendants in federal court in Manhattan in late 2009. He had to reverse course after being criticized by political leaders in New York and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress, who said a trial on U.S. soil carried too many security risks and costs. Although the Obama administration backed down and returned the case to the Defense Department, Holder has always said he believes that it would have been the better legal path to try Mohammed and the others in civilian court. \u201cNot to be egocentric about that, but I was right,\u201d Holder said when asked about his initial decision Monday. \u201cI had access to documents, files, recommendations by the military, U.S. attorney\u2019s offices in the Eastern District of Virginia, as well as the Southern District of New York. And I think the decision that I announced on that day was the right one. And I think that the facts and events that have occurred since then demonstrate that.\u201d The military commission proceeding is still in pretrial hearings, and it is unclear when the trial might start. Some lawyers estimate it might not begin for two years. \u201cSince they were arraigned last year, the military commission for the accused 9/11 co-conspirators continues to progress through pretrial hearings, giving the accused and their counsel the opportunity to fully raise and litigate their legal challenges,\u201d said Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a Defense Department spokesman.\n Holder said his decision was derailed for political, not legal, reasons. \u201cWe unfortunately did not go down that road, I think, for reasons other than those connected to the litigation, I think largely political,\u201d Holder said. \u201cThe opposition was largely political in nature. And I think this is an example of what happens when politics gets into matters that ought to be simply decided by lawyers and by national security experts.\u201d Holder cited a recent case, the prosecution in New York of Libyan Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, also known as Anas al-Libi, as an example of how the civilian court system can be effectively used to try foreign terrorism suspects. He is accused of involvement in the 1998 East African embassy bombings. \u201cIt is our intention to hold him totally accountable, as we have others who were part of that conspiracy,\u201d Holder said. \u201cIf you look at the history of the Article III prosecutions, you will see that they don\u2019t take nearly as long as those that occur in the military system. .\u2009.\u2009.

If the estimate is correct, the nearest ocean planet might be just 12 light-years away, which, though extremely distant for all practical purposes (such as sending a robotic space probe), is just around the corner in our galactic neighborhood. \u201cWhen you look up at the stars in the night sky, how many of them have a planet like the Earth?\u201d asked Erik Petigura, a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley and the lead author of the paper. \u201cWe\u2019re able to start answering this question.\u201d The best estimate is 22 percent of stars like our own, with an error margin of plus or minus 8 percent. \u201cEarth-sized planets having the temperature of a cup of tea are common around sunlike stars,\u201d said planet hunter Geoff Marcy, a Berkeley astronomer and a co-author of the study. He said the finding \u201crepresents one great leap toward the possibility of life, including intelligent life, in the universe.\u201d Kepler, launched in 2009, is no longer able to search for \u201cexoplanets\u201d \u2014 outside our solar system \u2014 because it has been unable to point with precision after the failure of a steering mechanism this year. But the telescope amassed more than three years of observations before going on the blink. Kepler mission scientist Natalie Batalha said there\u2019s still another full year of data to rummage through. The telescope\u2019s original mission was to obtain an estimate of the percentage of stars with potentially habitable planets, and this latest analysis comes close to meeting that goal. This is still an extrapolation of data, and is not the same thing as taking a careful census of these Earth-size planets directly, said Sara Seager, an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not directly involved in the new analysis. \u201cEarth-size\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cEarth-like,\u201d she noted. But she said this result will boost efforts to build new telescopes that could potentially obtain direct imagery of one of these extremely distant worlds. \u201cEarth-sized planets are not rare, so we\u2019ll know we\u2019ll have stuff to look at,\u201d Seager said. \u201cIt's reassuring for us.\" Jill Tarter, a pioneer in SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, said in an e-mail: \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet found Earth 2.0, but these statistics suggest that it should be forthcoming, and soon. When we can point to Earth 2.0 in the sky, it will seem completely natural to ask \u2018Does anybody live there?\u2019 and \u2018Can we go there?\u2019 I think Earth 2.0 will concretize SETI as nothing else has.\u201d   Kepler studied 150,000 stars in a small patch of the sky in the constellation Cygnus. The planets surrounding distant stars can\u2019t be seen directly, because their faint, reflected light is swamped by the much brighter starlight. Thus Kepler looked for the periodic dimming of a star, which could be the signal of a planet passing across the star\u2019s face. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The Kepler team has found amid Kepler\u2019s data 10 \u201ccandidate\u201d planets that, while not yet confirmed, appear to be roughly one to two times the mass of the Earth and orbiting at \u201cGoldilocks\u201d distances, neither too close nor too far from the stars.  The scientists extrapolated in two ways. They know that most planets are unlikely to be in orbits that, just by chance, cause them to pass in front of the face of the star as seen from Kepler. That\u2019s a 1-in-100 longshot. For every planet seen, multiply by 100. The scientists also knew that some planets would remain difficult to detect due to natural fluctuations in starlight \u2014 the \u201cnoise\u201d in the signal. They found a way to test the accuracy of the algorithms for detecting planets by inserting 40,000 \u201csynthetic\u201d planets into the computer programs and seeing how many would be accurately retrieved by those programs. The analysis doesn\u2019t prove that any of these \u201chabitable zone\u201d planets actually resembles Earth. The report states only that they are roughly the size of our planet and aren\u2019t too close or too far from the star for water \u2014 if it is present \u2014 to be liquid at the surface. Moreover, being in a star\u2019s habitable zone does not ensure that life will actually spring forth. Scientists have limited understanding of the origin of life on Earth. There could also be other constraints on life originating on another world. The Earth has a number of features that are amenable to life and that might not be common, including a nearly circular orbit, a large companion moon and tectonic activity that recycles the planet\u2019s carbon. Even with this new analysis, extraterrestrial life remains conjectural. There are no known examples of it, which is why skeptics sometimes say that exobiology is a science without a subject. But since the first extrasolar planet was discovered in 1995, hundreds more have been confirmed. Kepler has found 3,538 candidate planets, meaning planets that need to be confirmed by further observation, said Jason Rowe, a research scientist at the SETI Institute, at the news conference Monday at which Kepler results were announced. Of those, 647 are Earth-size, 104 are in the star\u2019s habitable zone and 10 meet both criteria. But William Borucki, the principle investigator for Kepler, noted that some of larger planets in the habitable zone might have moons amenable to life. \u201cAll of those 104, I think, are very interesting planets,\u201d Borucki said. He said that roughly 70 percent of stars appear to have at least one planet. If the new estimate is correct, by his calculation there should be about 25 billion Earth-size planets in habitable zones in our galaxy. \u201cThose numbers are pretty soft. We have a lot of corrections to make before we have really definitive numbers,\u201d Borucki said.", "topics": [], "author": "Joel Achenbach", "wordCount": 1021}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Jenkins: Richie Incognito must face stern NFL response for intolerable treatment of teammate", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/334ba3d0/sc/13/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Csports0Credskins0Crichie0Eincognito0Emust0Eface0Estern0Enfl0Eresponse0Efor0Eintolerable0Etreatment0Eof0Eteammate0C20A130C110C0A40C80A38a4a60E45810E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "The thug named Richie Incognito needs to be out of the NFL for a long time, maybe even permanently. The Miami Dolphins suspended Incognito overnight, and that\u2019s merely a good start. This guy is no mere \u201cbully\u201d; that\u2019s a schoolyard word that doesn\u2019t come close to describing the racist, menacing, strong-arm shakedown of his own teammate, Jonathan Martin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Imagine if you received threatening text messages from a colleague at work, hurling vile racial epithets at you along with a promise to \u201ckill you.\u201d What would you do? First, you would call company security, and then you might call the cops. But because this was the NFL, second-year player Martin thought he had to take it, otherwise he would be called soft. Finally, Martin simply walked away from the Dolphins \u2014 an act that is looking more manly and dignified by the second.  Turns out the real tough guy is Martin, whose decision to rebel against a vicious culture in the Dolphins\u2019 locker room has triggered a league-level investigation of Incognito, and, if reports are true, needs to extend to other veteran players and management as well. Let\u2019s be clear: This isn\u2019t about the wussifcation of football, or about some light hazing of rookies, short-sheeting their beds or shaving their heads. It\u2019s about an image the league has been trying desperately to change in recent years, and that Incognito personifies: players as conscienceless gangsters who play a game of uncontrolled violence, with sadism and excess as byproducts. The worst part of this story for the NFL is the suggestion that there is a lingering subterranean culture in which thuggery is not just tolerated but rewarded, while restraint is seen as weak. Martin, a second-year starter out of Stanford, was for days characterized by his own management as an oversensitive victim who couldn\u2019t take petty lunchtime bullying and had left the team with an emotional \u201cillness.\u201d But the Dolphins suddenly went into crisis mode Sunday, suspending Incognito around midnight for \u201cconduct detrimental to the team\u201d and asked for a full NFL investigation. That\u2019s because they finally realized what they have on their hands: Couple Incognito\u2019s threatening messages to Martin with complaints from Dolphins rookies to the Miami Herald that they were pressured to pick up tabs of $30,000 for veteran players\u2019 binges at strip clubs, and an ESPN report that Incognito forced Martin to pay $15,000 for a trip to Las Vegas, and this doesn\u2019t look like \u201chazing\u201d anymore. It looks like extortion and intimidation. What\u2019s next, Incognito will feed the snitch into a cement mixer and bury him in a parking lot? This story has sickened people across all boundaries in the league, as well it should. Prediction: Incognito\u2019s case won\u2019t produce the kind of player-commissioner tension we\u2019ve seen over other disciplinary issues. If Roger Goodell wreaks his full powers on Incognito, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone complaining he is too harsh. Incognito deserves due process, but the documentary evidence of his abusive threats to Martin is apparently plain and incontrovertible, and so is his past.   Fellow players annually vote him one of the dirtiest competitors in the league, an eye-gouger who has had issues on virtually every team he ever played for. He was suspended for off-field behavior at Nebraska, and in four years with the St. Louis Rams, he was penalized 38 times, including seven times for unnecessary roughness and was waived in 2009 after earning head-butting penalties and getting in a screaming match with then-coach Steve Spagnuolo. He has been fined and warned by the league that he was courting suspension. Now this. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The NFL is a hard enough profession without guys like Incognito making it harder. The NFL Players Association has worked for years to build solidarity and persuade older players to teach younger ones how to take care of themselves and their money, given the rate at which their health is shattered. Union head DeMaurice Smith has said, \u201cAll players have a responsibility to each other.\u201d The league executive office has done the same under vice president Troy Vincent, who has worked exhaustively on \u201cplayer engagement\u201d programs that preach mentorship and a sense of mutual responsibility.  Incognito\u2019s abuse of a talented young player, a teammate who literally had to stand side by side with him every day, must be equally appalling to both sides, as must be the fact that he was actually a team leader and his attitude appeared to be catching. The saddest part of all? Rookies under the last collective bargaining agreement actually surrendered millions of dollars in income to support older players. Jonathan Martin was already paying Incognito, without a shakedown. Yet no one on the Dolphins roster seems to recognize that. Recently fourth-year Miami player Jared Odrick tweeted a picture of a Henry VIII-sized banquet table loaded with food, and wrote, \u201cEverything tastes better when a rookie pays for it.\u201d In an interview with the Herald, one young Dolphin player anonymously claimed he is literally going broke as a result of the system Dolphin vets called a \u201cvirgin tax,\u201d because he felt unable to say \u201cno\u201d to demands for payment from guys such as Incognito. Incognito and his ilk are not the NFL\u2019s Representative Men \u2014 you hope. In any other profession, someone who threatened and extorted a co-worker would be unemployable. The league is full of good guys and good teammates who play football with exquisite self-control, including the half-dozen players who have signed on to nationwide anti-bullying campaigns.

Kerry made what amounted to an emergency fence-mending trip to Saudi Arabia on Monday, reassuring King Abdullah in a rare and lengthy meeting that the United States considers the kingdom a major partner and regional power and that the Obama administration will step up its consultation on issues important to both nations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t During his two-hour meeting with the king, and in separate sessions with Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, Kerry sought to explain President Obama\u2019s decision to limit direct U.S. military involvement in Syria and repeated assurances he made Sunday in Cairo that the United States remains committed to strong support of Egypt. He also denied widespread speculation here that Obama is willing to accept a less-than-ironclad nuclear deal with Iran during the current round of negotiations. \u201cThe United States will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,\u201d Kerry said in an airport news conference with the foreign minister before departing. \u201cDid I give some assurances? Yes, absolutely. Of course I did,\u201d he added. Without acknowledging any lack of consultations, Kerry said he had made clear that \u201cwe will very much brief our friends here on a regular basis so that there are no surprises and there is a clarity to the road ahead. And I hope that .\u2009.\u2009. is a welcome process.\u201d Concerns among regional partners over Obama\u2019s Middle East policies are not new. Saudi worries that Obama\u2019s eagerness for a deal with Tehran will lead to compromise \u2014 despite the president\u2019s frequent insistence that he will settle for no less than a non-nuclear Iran \u2014 are shared by Israel and others . Nor were the Saudis alone in the region in their disappointment over U.S. reluctance to become more directly involved in the Syrian conflict, as well as Obama\u2019s abrupt decision at the end of August to put on hold a planned military strike against Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program while he consulted with Congress. But increasingly public criticism from the Saudis in recent weeks of what they and others have privately decried as a lack of U.S. leadership in the region \u2014 at least as far as their priorities are concerned \u2014 appeared to have caught the administration\u2019s attention, as the Saudis no doubt intended. On the eve of a previously scheduled North Africa trip, Kerry added the stops in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Jordan and the West Bank. While he has not indicated any policy changes, so far his interlocutors have appeared to appreciate the attention and the effort. At their joint news conference, both Kerry and Saud sharply denied any serious breach, saying the ability of the United States and Saudi Arabia to disagree and stay friends is evidence that their acknowledged differences are merely over tactics rather than objectives. They emphasized close cooperation on a range of issues from energy to counterterrorism. Saud, calling the relationship \u201chistoric\u201d and grounded in mutual respect, discounted what he said were reports that ties between the two countries are \u201cdramatically deteriorating.\u201d And he said that a \u201ctrue relationship between friends is based on sincerity, candor and frankness, rather than mere courtesy.\u201d   Kerry was equally effusive, calling U.S.-Saudi ties \u201cstrategic\u201d and the kingdom \u201can indispensable partner.\u201d Saudi Arabia, he added, \u201cobviously has independent and important views of its own, and we respect that.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t As he has in the past, Kerry sought to explain to the Saudis, who have provided a steady flow of cash and weapons to the Syrian rebels, that U.S. willingness to do the same is limited. In what may have been the frankest description to date of administration views, Kerry said at the news conference that \u201cabsent a negotiated solution, we don\u2019t see a lot of ways to end the violence that are implementable or palatable to us, because we don\u2019t have the legal authority or justification or the desire, at this point, to get in the middle of the civil war.\u201d Saud said he supports U.S.- and Russian-backed plans for a political conference to negotiate a Syrian transition government to replace President Bashar al-Assad. But \u201cnegotiations shouldn\u2019t just go on indefinitely,\u201d he said, and \u201cpartial solutions just won\u2019t do.\u201d The conference has been rescheduled repeatedly since last spring, as both sides have refused to fully commit to its terms. It is now tentatively scheduled for late this month in Geneva. The only light moment in the news conference came when a female American reporter asked Kerry for his \u201ctake on women driving in Saudi Arabia,\u201d where small groups of women publicly took to the roads last month in defiance of a ban. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask me that question?\u201d Saud interjected amid laughter from the entirely male Saudi press contingent. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d Kerry told him. After a brief but awkward pause, Saud began talking again about Iran. When his turn came, Kerry said, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that in the United States of America we embrace equality for everybody.\u201d But, he said, \u201cit\u2019s up to Saudi Arabia to make its own decisions about its own social structure.\u201d Kerry also denied reports in the Israeli news media Monday that the administration has told Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators that it will present them with its own plan for resolving core issues if they can\u2019t come up with solutions by January. \u201cLet me categorically dispel any notion that there is anything other than the track that is formally engaged in between Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d Kerry said of the U.S.-sponsored talks. \u201cIt\u2019s just incorrect; there is no other plan at this point in time.\u201d Kerry ducked a question about threats by Pakistani political leaders to again close the land route by which most U.S. military supplies are leaving Afghanistan, following last week\u2019s CIA drone strike that reportedly killed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban the day before the government there was due to open peace talks with the insurgent group. Without confirming the drone strike, Kerry said that Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was \u201ca man who absolutely is known to have targeted and killed many Americans, many Afghans and many Pakistanis.\u201d The United States, he said, intends to \u201ccontinue to work\u201d with the Pakistani government.", "topics": [], "author": "Karen DeYoung", "wordCount": 1009}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Supreme Court lets stand Oklahoma court ruling against part of new abortion law", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/645348/s/3349666f/sc/42/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Csupreme0Ecourt0Elets0Estand0Eoklahoma0Ecourt0Eruling0Eagainst0Epart0Eof0Enew0Eabortion0Elaw0C20A130C110C0A40Cbbf6dbd40E455e0E11e30Eb6f80E3782ff6cb7690Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ihomepage/story01.htm", "text": "The Supreme Court decided Monday not to review a ruling by Oklahoma\u2019s highest court that a major portion of the state\u2019s restrictive abortion law is unconstitutional because it effectively bans all drug-induced \nabortions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The justices had tentatively agreed in the summer to consider the issue but asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court for clarification on what the law proscribes. The Oklahoma court issued an opinion last week saying that the law would effectively end the early-term practice of drug-induced, nonsurgical abortions and was thus unconstitutional. Upon receiving the Oklahoma opinion, the Supreme Court said it had decided against scheduling the case for briefing and arguments. As is customary, the justices gave no reason for deciding not to hear the case. It seemed clear, however, that it is only a matter of time before challenges to a wave of abortion restrictions passed by the states reaches the justices. The court last ruled on abortion in 2007, when it upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. That decision has prompted some states to be bolder in restricting the procedure. One such state is Texas, and Monday a coalition of health-care providers asked the high court to keep a portion of Texas\u2019s new law from going into effect while it still can be challenged in lower courts. At issue is a law requiring doctors who provide abortions to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital. The requirement has meant that about a third of the clinics offering abortions in Texas have had to stop providing the procedure. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the law could go into effect while it was being challenged. The petition from the providers was addressed to Justice Antonin Scalia, who hears emergency matters from that circuit. He has called for a response from Texas by Nov. 12. The restrictive Texas abortion law has roiled the state\u2019s politics. It is being aggressively defended by Attorney General Greg Abbott (R), who is seeking the governorship. His likely Democratic opponent is state Sen. Wendy Davis, who became famous for filibustering the bill in June. It later passed in a special session of the legislature. The Oklahoma law regarding drug-induced abortions is similar to those passed in Texas, Ohio and other states. They say doctors must follow the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s regimen for the use of an \u201cabortion-inducing drug\u201d and forbids them from prescribing medications for \u201coff-label use.\u201d Supporters of the law say the procedure protects women. But the Oklahoma court concluded that it effectively bans medication abortions, which are used early in pregnancies, because doctors over the past decade have found the FDA protocol to be excessive or outdated. Only mifepristone, commonly referred to as RU-486, has been approved by the FDA for inducing abortions. But doctors in the past decade have used a second drug \u2014 misoprostol \u2014 in conjunction with mifepristone to complete the process. A third drug, methotrexate, is commonly prescribed to terminate ectopic pregnancies, although the FDA has not approved its use. The Oklahoma justices said that since mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000, doctors have found that only about a third of the labeled dosage is necessary. The state court said that 96 percent of medication abortions use the smaller dosage plus misoprostol, which can be taken at home instead of at a medical facility. Those procedures cannot be used under the new law, the court said. Nor may methotrexate be used for ectopic pregnancies, it said. Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, welcomed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to let the Oklahoma court\u2019s decision stand, saying the court \u201crecognized this law for what it is, an outright ban on a safe method of ending a pregnancy in its earliest stages and an unconstitutional attack on women\u2019s health and rights. \u201cPoliticians have been pushing for these restrictions nationwide under the thin pretext of protecting women\u2019s health, but their real agenda is to deny women their right to end a pregnancy safely, early and in consultation with their doctors,\u201d Northup said. Oklahoma Attorney General E. Scott Pruett (R) said the U.S. Supreme Court had \u201clittle choice but to dismiss the case\u201d because of what he called the \u201coverly broad and erroneous interpretation of the Oklahoma law\u201d by the state court. \u201cWe are disappointed with the state court\u2019s interpretation of a law that was crafted by the legislature to protect Oklahoma women from potentially deadly protocols that have never been approved by the FDA,\u201d he said. The issue of whether doctors must follow FDA labels might find its way back to the Supreme Court. A federal judge upheld Ohio\u2019s restrictive law. And a judge in Texas recently took a middle ground, finding the restrictions in that state\u2019s new law constitutional so long as there was an exception when the woman\u2019s life or health is threatened.

Lenders of all types had already been raising the bar for borrowers, turning away all but the best customers. This week, they became even less willing to part with their money, further crimping budgets and family spending. An economy propelled by easy credit for more than a decade is fraying as credit disappears. American Express , to take one striking example, is reducing the maximum credit limit for half of its tens of millions of cardholders. The credit shock is in some ways reminiscent of the 1973 oil embargo, which \u0093came into people\u0092s lives right away,\u0094 said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center , the public opinion pollster. Then, Americans were forced to line up for gasoline and turn down their thermostats in winter. Though less visible, the credit squeeze, if it persists, will force businesses and consumers to cut spending more than they already have. \u0093We have moved into a decline in consumer spending, which normally happens only in a major recession,\u0094 said Ethan Harris, chief domestic economist at Lehman Brothers . He calls the experience \u0093a slow-motion recession in which economic growth will be near zero for an extended period of time.\u0094 Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of American economic activity and has been slowing as the value of homes falls. Although the economy is not yet in a formal recession, consumer spending in June and July grew only because consumers paid more for the same goods. After factoring in higher prices, they actually bought less. Borrowers are finding that the nation\u0092s lenders are tightening up in numerous ways. American Express is hardly alone. After several banks said they would not lend the asking price, a tractor-trailer dealer in North Carolina had to cut the $20,000 he was seeking for a second-hand tractor to $14,000. And a commercial real estate agent, trying to raise $4 million by refinancing an apartment building, got only half that amount from the Bank of Smithtown on Long Island, even though the building was appraised for $10 million. \u0093With marginal lenders in trouble, we have more people than ever coming to us for loans,\u0094 said Brad Rock, chairman of the Smithtown bank. \u0093So all of a sudden, we can be much pickier in deciding what loans to make and how much to lend.\u0094 Being pickier means that an American Express cardholder whose maximum has been reduced to $1,000 from $1,200 has that much less to spend on clothing or meals out, purchases that lift the economy. At $14,000 for a used tractor, a trucker, caught in the same squeeze as the dealer, would lack a sufficient down payment for a new tractor, which costs more than $100,000. Indeed, many truckers in this situation find themselves looking for other work, even as job seekers across the nation outnumber job openings by more than 2 to 1, the biggest mismatch since 2004, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. And the commercial real estate agent is shy $2 million that would have been invested in a new venture to generate economic growth. Mr. Rock, also chairman of the American Bankers Association, with 8,400 affiliates, does not see a problem in this turn of events. \u0093Now people are going to actually have to have a job to get a loan and they are going to have to make installment payments that are already higher per dollar borrowed than they used to be,\u0094 he said, arguing that the debt-fueled prosperity of the bubble years was unsustainable. But there is not, for the moment, an adequate replacement. Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist, ticks off the alternatives and discounts them. Exports could carry some of the load, but the surge in the first half of the year is fading as European and Asian economies weaken. Here at home, capital spending by business on new buildings and equipment could provide a lift, but that, too, is beginning to fade as corporate profits \u0097 and demand \u0097 weaken. Just Wednesday, FedEx announced that profits had shrunk in the latest quarter as freight traffic declined. Home construction is off the table, of course, as a means of lifting the economy. That leaves government, which could inject money into the economy through aid to the states or infrastructure spending or another round of tax rebates. The administration has suggested a program, akin to Resolution Trust Corporation \u0092s role in the savings and loan crisis, that could help rescue the housing market. The program would buy distressed-assets and then dispose of them overtime. In a news conference Friday morning, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. , said he would discuss the plan to create the government-sponsored vehicle with members of Congress this weekend and expected them to pass legislation next week. Meanwhile, the barriers to borrowing go up. By late summer, a majority of the nation\u0092s lenders had tightened standards for every type of credit, the Federal Reserve\u0092s bank surveys show. Home equity lines of credit have been canceled or reduced as home prices have fallen. Credit card companies are imposing higher delinquency fees, stepping up collection efforts and checking on repayment histories. \u0093More and more, they don\u0092t give the card if you don\u0092t have a good credit record,\u0094 Mr. Harris, of Lehman Brothers, said. Michael O\u0092Neill, an American Express vice president, agrees. He adds that the company is offering fewer new cards than in the past in Florida, California and parts of the Southwest, all areas where home prices have fallen the most. And quietly, American Express is skinning back credit limits. The company is always reviewing its millions of accounts, normally increasing the limit on three out of four, and decreasing the fourth. Since July, \u0093the tilt is 50-50,\u0094 Mr. O\u0092Neill said. The North Carolina truck dealer originally listed a 2001 Freightliner for $20,000 on truckertotrucker.com , an online marketplace for tractors and trailers, and this week, he dropped the price to $14,000 because of the growing resistance from bankers, said James McCormack, who operates the site. \u0093The banks were giving loans for the full value of these trucks and the value was falling, and the truckers found themselves owing more than the trucks were worth,\u0094 Mr. McCormack said. \u0093They found themselves forced to keep driving or let the banks repossess, and many have elected repossession.\u0094 Debt traps and loan famines, in one form or another, can prove costly to companies. Harley-Davidson , for example, which finances purchases of its motorcycles, is issuing bonds and notes at slightly higher rates to support its financing arm. Restaurants in the casual-dining sector are in a severe slump, according to industry analysts, and will most likely come under further pressure. The pancake house IHOP bought Applebee\u0092s last year with a strategy of selling off company-owned stores to franchisees. Now known as DineEquity, the company may have problems finding prospective franchisees who can obtain financing, industry analysts said. The winners so far are the Brad Rocks of America, the bankers who have emerged unscathed, their capital intact and with enough retained earnings to support lending, on their terms. A residential mortgage from Bank of Smithtown requires 20 percent down and clear evidence of adequate income to repay the loan, as well as a good record of paying down debt. Bank of Smithtown specializes in small businesses \u0097 the stationery stores, pizza parlors and pharmacies of eastern Long Island with annual revenue of $2 million or less, regularly in need of bridge loans, for example. During the credit boom, Mr. Rock said, many of these business owners went to lenders who required, as he put it, nothing more than a tax ID number to qualify for a loan. \u0093Now many of these lenders are gone,\u0094 Mr. Rock said, \u0093and the small-business borrowers are coming to us, and we are doing good old-fashioned underwriting, and the result is that fewer people are getting loans.\u0094", "topics": [], "author": "LOUIS UCHITELLE", "wordCount": 1327}, {"date": "2008-09-18 00:00:00", "domain": "www-nc.nytimes.com", "title": "Vast Bailout by U.S. Proposed in Bid to Stem Financial Crisis", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/business/19fed.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve began discussions on Thursday with Congressional leaders on what could become the biggest bailout in United States history.   \n \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nWhile details remain to be worked out, the plan is likely to authorize the government to buy distressed mortgages at deep discounts from banks and other institutions. The proposal could result in the most direct commitment of taxpayer funds so far in the financial crisis that Fed and Treasury officials say is the worst they have ever seen.   \nSenior aides and lawmakers said the goal was to complete the legislation by the end of next week, when Congress is scheduled to adjourn. The legislation would grant new authority to the administration and require what several officials said would be a substantial appropriation of federal dollars, though no figures were disclosed in the meeting.   \nDemocrats, having their own desire for a second round of economic aid for struggling Americans, see the administration\u2019s request as a way to win White House approval of new spending to help stimulate the economy in exchange for support for the Treasury request. Democrats also say they will push for relief for homeowners faced with foreclosure in return for supporting any broad bailout of struggling financial institutions.   \n\u201cWhat we are working on now is an approach to deal with systemic risks and stresses in our capital markets,\u201d said Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the Treasury secretary. \u201cAnd we talked about a comprehensive approach that would require legislation to deal with the illiquid assets on financial institutions\u2019 balance sheets,\u201d he added.   \nOne model for the proposal could be the Resolution Trust Corporation , which bought up and eventually sold hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of real estate in the 1990s from failed savings-and-loan companies. In this case, however, the government is expected to take over only distressed assets, not entire institutions. And it is not clear that a new agency would be created to manage and dispose of the assets, or whether the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department would do so.   \nThe bailout discussions came on a day when the Federal Reserve poured almost $300 billion into global credit markets and barely put a dent in the level of alarm.   \nHoping to shore up confidence with a show of financial shock and awe, the Federal Reserve stunned investors before dawn on Thursday by announcing a plan to provide $180 billion to financial markets through lending programs operated by the European Central Bank and the central banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and Switzerland.   \nBut after an initial sense of relief swept markets in Asia and Europe, the fear quickly returned. Tensions remained so high that the Federal Reserve had to inject an extra $100 billion, in two waves of $50 billion each, just to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent.   \nNone of those actions, however, brought much catharsis or relief, with banks around the world remaining too frightened to lend to each other, much less to their customers. This forced Mr. Paulson and Ben S. Bernanke , the Fed chairman, to think the unthinkable: committing taxpayer money to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in distressed assets from struggling institutions.   \nRumors about the Bush administration\u2019s new stance swept through the stock markets Thursday afternoon. By the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 617 points from its low point in midafternoon, the biggest surge in six years, and ended the day with a gain of 410 points or 3.9 percent.   \nThe rally continued in early trading in Asia. The Australian market was up 3.5 percent by mid-day there and the Nikkei 225 Index was up 2.9 percent in Tokyo.   \n\u201cThe markets voted, and they liked the proposal,\u201d said Laurence H. Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers.   \nThe stock surge began after Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York, announced his own proposal for a government rescue on the Senate floor and declared that both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were open to all ideas.   \n\u201cThe Federal Reserve and the Treasury are realizing that we need a more comprehensive solution,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to them about it.\u201d   \nStill, the evening discussions took most of Washington by surprise, especially since Congress had been trying to finish up its business and head home to campaign for re-election.   \nThe scale and complexity of the project are almost certain to create huge philosophical differences among the parties, which could make negotiations difficult to say the least. Still, lawmakers said the goal was to work through the coming weekend and to have both the House and Senate vote on a measure by the end of next week.   \nAs they exited the session, grim-faced lawmakers said they would await proposals from the Treasury Department. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid , said he expected to see a proposal within hours, not days.   \n\u201cWhat we agreed to do is sit down together on a bipartisan basis and work together to solve the problem,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who said no specific approach was advocated by the administration officials.   \nPresident Bush and his top advisers have adamantly opposed bailouts, but the mortgage crisis has already forced the Treasury and the Fed to bail out four of the country\u2019s most prominent financial institutions \u2014 Bear Stearns in March; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earlier this month; and American International Group , the insurance conglomerate, just this week.   \nCreated in 1989, the Resolution Trust Corporation disposed of bad assets held by hundreds of crippled savings institutions. The agency closed or reorganized 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400 billion. It did so by seizing the assets of troubled savings and loans , then reselling them to bargain-seeking investors.   \nBy 1995, the S.& L. crisis had abated and the agency was folded into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which Congress created during the Great Depression to regulate banks and protect the accounts of customers when they fail.   \n \n \t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Carl Hulse and David M. Herszenhorn contributed report- ing. \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nBy any reckoning, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke were desperate for a way to stem the crisis once and for all by Thursday evening. Over the previous 10 days, they had allowed one Wall Street firm, Lehman Brothers , to collapse; and an even bigger Wall Street firm, Merrill Lynch , to be sold to Bank of America . Then, on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve abruptly took over the nation\u2019s biggest insurance conglomerate, the American International Group, and began bailing it out with an $85 billion loan.   \n \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe meeting in the Capitol, which began around 7 p.m., came after Congressional leaders had initially appeared unclear about what role they would play in the rapid-fire decisions being made. Leaders of both parties had complained about a lack of hard information flowing from the administration. House Republicans even canceled a closed-door party session Thursday morning after the administration refused to provide an official to brief them on the administration\u2019s emerging policies.   \nBut as Thursday progressed, Congressional leaders sought to reassert themselves on the crisis, scheduling oversight hearings, calling for a legislative response to the market turmoil and offering to put off an adjournment scheduled to start at the end of next week if the administration and Congress could find common ground on a solution.   \n Nancy Pelosi , the House speaker, in a letter sent Thursday evening to President Bush, reiterated that view. \u201cWe stand ready beyond the targeted adjournment date of September 26 to permit Congress to consider legislative proposals and conduct necessary investigations,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in the letter, which said \u201cthe worsening crisis in our financial markets demands strong solutions and decisive leadership.\u201d   \nBut whether a legislative consensus could be found remained an open question, and members of Mr. Bush\u2019s own party were among those who were most critical of the increasing federal intervention in private markets.   \nAt the meeting Thursday night, where officials said the atmosphere was tense, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, was notably skeptical.   \nA spokesman for the senator, Jonathan Graffeo, said later: \u201cSenator Shelby believes it\u2019s his responsibility to be skeptical on behalf of taxpayers. He believes our goal must be to minimize taxpayer exposure while maximizing the benefit to the economy. \u201d   \nEarlier in the day, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, had expressed similar wariness about the risk to taxpayers\u2019 funds. And Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who heads a coalition of House conservatives, was circulating a letter to the administration demanding that it not engage in any further bailouts.   \nEven before the Thursday night session with Mr. Paulson \u2014 the second for top Congressional leaders this week \u2014 the House had scheduled new oversight hearings. The Financial Services Committee set a session for next week, with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke as witnesses. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee set hearings for early October to examine developments that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of A.I.G., even though Congress is to be in recess.   \nMs. Pelosi, suggesting the public was probably not of a mind to wait until 2009 for a Congressional fix, said lawmakers first had to explore the causes of the problems and potential solutions in hearings.   \n\u201cLet\u2019s hear from the Bernankes and the Paulsons and the rest what their view of it is,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s hear from the private sector. How these captains of the financial world could make millions of dollars in salary, and yet their companies fail and then we have to step in to bail them out.\u201d   \nMr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke have been studying an array of new and sometimes radical approaches to fight what current and former Fed officials describe as the worst financial crisis they have ever seen.   \nThe Fed has already stretched itself very thin by introducing new emergency lending programs for banks, Wall Street firms and, this week, a giant insurance company.   \nWith the Fed running short of unencumbered reserves, the Treasury Department had begun raising fresh cash for the central bank by selling new Treasury bills at an unprecedented pace \u2014 $200 billion this week alone \u2014 and parking it at the Fed for whatever use it wanted.   \n \n \t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Carl Hulse and David M.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  Thirty-four years ago today, Iranian followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. They took 52 Americans hostage and held them captive for more than a year. And today, as has happened on this day ever since, thousands of Iranian hardliners again took to the streets for what they call Death to America Day.  This year, however, the annual display of hostility coincides with a delicate diplomatic outreach by Iran's government. Iran wants the international community to ease sanctions related to its nuclear program.  Here's NPR's Peter Kenyon.  PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Iran and the U.S. may be entering a new phase of diplomatic engagement, but hardliners on both sides are having none of it. Today, Iranian conservatives turned out in force to remind the world, and their own leadership, that decades of enmity cannot be overcome by a new president with a more pragmatic approach.  (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING PROTESTERS)  KENYON: American flags and effigies of Uncle Sam were burnt, caricatures of President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were hoisted, and the ubiquitous yellow placards read: Down with America in English, although the Farsi chants are usually translated by conservatives as Death to America.  (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING PROTESTERS)  KENYON: The rallies were a reminder that in Tehran, rapprochement with America remains a major political hazard. Some analysts saw the day's message aimed as much at the Iranian political class as anywhere else. Hardliners have chafed at the rapid pace of engagement from Rouhani's administration, complaining most loudly when Rouhani took a telephone call from President Obama in September.  Rouhani has said that a slogan such as Death to America isn't really necessary, but Iranian MP Alaeddin Boroujerdi told Iran's English-language Press TV that it will remain necessary until Washington changes its approach to dealing with Tehran.  ALAEDDDIN BOROUJERDI: (Through Translator) The U.S. hostile policies have not changed towards Iran. Even Washington, without making any change in its policy, has imposed rounds of unilateral sanctions against Tehran. This causes our people not to stop chanting a slogan against the U.S. This slogan is just a symbol of the Iranian people's hatred towards Washington.  KENYON: In a matter of days, Rouhani's nuclear negotiators will be in Geneva, pushing for more progress on an agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. Fixing the economy is a vital mandate for Rouhani, and even Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, a man steeped in suspicion and hatred for the U.S., said in a speech Sunday that the nuclear team is off-limits to attack.  SUPREME LEADER ALI KHAMENEI: (Foreign language spoken)  KENYON: In an address to students, Khamenei vilified the U.S. but said, quote, \"Nobody is entitled to insult our negotiators as compromisers.\" The speech is seen as the latest sign that when it comes to the nuclear issue, Rouhani has latitude to compromise. But hardliners will be on alert should the new government take that same pragmatic approach to other issues.  Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Istanbul.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block in Washington.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish at NPR West in California.  The ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi made a brief appearance in court today. He refused to wear the requisite white prison jump suit. And he declared his trial illegitimate, insisting that he is the president of Egypt and the victim of a coup. The session was so chaotic that the judge adjourned the trial until January. Morsi was transferred to a prison outside the port city of Alexandria.  NPR's Leila Fadel attended the trial.  LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Morsi hadn't been seen or heard in public since the July 3rd military coup. But on Monday, he strutted into the prosecution cage of a Cairo courtroom, dressed in a suit and no tie, to the applause of his fellow defendants and cheers from his defense lawyers. When the judge asked him to identify himself, the ousted leader defiantly declared: My name is Dr. Mohamed Morsi and I am the president of the Republic.  Journalists were not allowed to bring recording equipment into the courtroom and only fleeting images with no sound were broadcast on State TV.  (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING PROTESTERS)  FADEL: But outside, hundreds of pro-Morsi protesters chanted his name and hurled insults at Egypt's military chief, General Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, who led the coup against Morsi after millions of Egyptians took to the streets to demand his removal.  (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING PROTESTERS)  FADEL: The protesters never heard Morsi's courtroom tirades. He called the court illegitimate, the coup a crime and demanded that its orchestrators be tried. Egyptian journalists and a few policemen responded with shouts of: Execution, execution, as the session descended into chaos.  When the judge called an adjournment, Ibrahim Bakry, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood defense team, said he was a bit relieved.  IBRAHIM BAKRY: (Foreign language spoken)  FADEL: He says the team needs time to review the case. They've had no access to the evidence. And so far, no one from the defense team has been allowed to see Morsi.  BAKRY: (Foreign language spoken)  FADEL: Bakry says its unlikely Morsi will receive a fair trial. He alleged that the judge, Ahmed Sabry, was handpicked because he's against Morsi.  Morsi and 14 other defendants, most members of the Muslim Brotherhood, are facing an array of charges ranging from incitement to premeditated murder. The charges stem from an attack by Muslim Brotherhood members on opposition protesters, outside the presidential palace in Cairo last December.  Human Rights Watch says at least eleven people were killed in those clashes, including four Brotherhood members. The rights group says dozens of anti-Morsi protesters were detained and tortured by supporters of the Brotherhood.  Morsi supporters say the trial is only focused on the alleged crimes of the Brotherhood and is ignoring the deaths of Morsi protesters in the December clashes. That, they say, is proof that the case is political.  ABDEL RAHMAN MAMDOUH: (Foreign language spoken)  FADEL: Abdel Rahman Mamdouh says his brother, a Muslim Brotherhood member, was killed the day of those clashes. He spoke outside the courtroom today.  MAMDOUH: (Foreign language spoken)  FADEL: He says, I'm here to show that this is all a charade.  But lawyer Ragia Omran, disagrees.  RAGIA OMRAN: It's not political at all. This is a criminal case and it has been documented. This case has been on the ground working since the fifth of December. We have submitted complaints which are documented on the prosecution.  FADEL: In the politically charged atmosphere, most analysts agree say it will be almost impossible for Morsi to receive a fair trial. Ziad Akl, is on the staff of the Ahram Center of Political and Strategic Studies.  ZIAD AKL: This trial could hardly be objective. There's definitely a lot of political polarization, that I don't think any kind of judgment on that trial could be based merely on law.  FADEL: Morsi has become an iconic symbol for supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. But for many Egyptians the start of his trial was a moment of justice and a nation moving on.

Michel Martin is away. Coming up, activists in Washington, D.C. are asking jury members to vote their conscience not the law. We'll ask why some people think jury nullification is the only way for minorities to get a fair day in court. That's in just a few minutes.  First, though, we head to Syria. The war there is of course still raging on, and the State Department says the situation there is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. While the U.S. government has backed off its threats of military intervention, the government is calling for humanitarian action. We're joined now by Anne Richard. She's the assistant secretary for population, refugees and migration at the State Department. Thank you so much for joining us.  ANNE RICHARD: Thanks for having me on today.  HEADLEE: Help me get my mind around the crisis - the humanitarian crisis in Syria. I mean, what kind of crisis are we talking about? Katrina-sized, Bosnia, Rwanda - how big is this problem?  RICHARD: It is hard to get your mind around...  HEADLEE: Yeah.  RICHARD: ...The size of this crisis because I've never seen anything that has grown so big, so quickly, in such a short amount of time. Over the past year, we've gone from 230,000 refugees to 2.2 million refugees.  HEADLEE: Holy cow.  RICHARD: So that's 10 times as many. And that's a smaller number than the people who are displaced inside Syria and have fled for their lives and are seeking a safe place to live...  HEADLEE: Many of them children.  RICHARD: ...Inside their own country. Three quarters of the refugees are women and children, and that's not unusual for a refugee population. But it does mean that we have to tailor the aid that they get to the special needs.  HEADLEE: And we're now coming to learn of a polio outbreak in Syria, which complicates the problem even further, I have to assume.  RICHARD: Epidemiologists and other health experts have known for some time that disease can spread quickly through populations on the move like this. And so one of the first things they are concerned about is always measles and about the health of people who don't have good clean water and sanitation. But the resurgence of polio is particularly tragic because polio had been sort of defeated all over the world and was only found in three places. And now we see it coming back, both in the Horn of Africa and here, and this is very, very sad.  HEADLEE: And I assume concerning because that could spread even further as these refugees go into surrounding countries.  RICHARD: It would be of concern anywhere because it could spread. But in the middle of a war zone, it means it's very hard to treat it...  HEADLEE: Yeah.  RICHARD: ...And get children vaccinated. And this is the problem of what happens during war. You have the breakdown of society, and things like normal vaccinations, kids going to school, people going to work, that all goes out the window.  HEADLEE: Now the State Department is calling on the Assad regime to give access to humanitarian workers. What is happening when humanitarian workers try to get in to treat people and to deliver goods?  RICHARD: It's more than the State Department calling on them. There was a presidential statement coming out of the UN Security Council right after the UN Security Council passed a resolution on chemical weapons. And the statement on humanitarian assistance called on the Assad regime - called on all parties to the conflict to let the convoys get in, stop targeting medical facilities and doctors and stop targeting innocent civilians. And so, unfortunately...  HEADLEE: We haven't...  RICHARD: ...We haven't seen that happen. We've seen, instead, that the Assad regime is pursuing something that's been called a starvation into submission campaign, which means to cut off aid to cities so that people inside become malnourished and can no longer fight back.  HEADLEE: So you had talked earlier about tailoring the aid to - specifically to help women and children in particular who make up the vast majority of these refugees, especially. What does that mean? What kind of aid do women and children in particular need?  RICHARD: Well, all people of course need the basics...  HEADLEE: Food, water, shelter.  RICHARD: ...That everyone would think of. Exactly, food, water and shelter. But little children need more nutrition for starting out in life or else they'll have stunted growth. Women and girls can be preyed upon and exploited in a situation of upheaval. So we have programs...  HEADLEE: Sexually.  RICHARD: Exactly, sexual and gender-based violence. So we have programs to do more to prevent that right at the outset of the emergency. Secretary of State Kerry announced a program to particularly target the early stages of a crisis at the UN General Assembly this year. So we know what needs to be done. The bigger problem for us is trying to get the aid workers to the people who need the aid. Humanitarian access, as we call it, the ability to reach people in need is a major problem right now inside Syria.  HEADLEE: What about outside? What about those who have successfully made it to a refugee camp, say, in Turkey? What are the conditions like in those refugee camps?  RICHARD: The countries that border Syria are all hosting refugees, and we're very grateful to those countries that they are. Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon have...  HEADLEE: Yeah.  RICHARD: ...All taken refugees in. Turkey is the most economically able to host them. It doesn't mean it's not challenging to take in over half a million refugees, but they've set up a series of over 20 camps that are really very well established and run in comparison to refugee camps elsewhere in the world. Jordan and Lebanon are taking in what for them is really a third wave of refugees because Palestinian refugees have lived in their countries for decades.  Iraqis fled to these same countries, and some Iraqis are fleeing now for a second time from Syria. And then this third wave of refugees are the Syrians themselves, who formerly had hosted refugees and are now on the run. So in Jordan, they built one very large camp. In Lebanon, they have no camps. But in all of these countries, most of the refugees don't live in camps. They live in the villages. They live in the cities, and they're trying to make it wherever they are. And we find that not only do the refugees need help, but countries like Jordan and Lebanon that are not wealthy need help to help their communities host all these refugees.  HEADLEE: So what exactly can other nations do? I mean, I have to assume that when there's an outbreak of war, it's relatively normal that aid workers have a hard time getting safely into a war-torn country. So what exactly can - what steps can we take to help the people of Syria?  RICHARD: I think what's different about Syria is that the battle lines are not drawn in a neat division across the country. It's more like a checkerboard, and the battle lines are in flux. So there are opposition-held areas. There's a fractured opposition. There are areas that are being fought over.  HEADLEE: Or passed back and forth.  RICHARD: Exactly, and then there's regime-controlled areas. So what we've found is it is harder in Syria because, for example, a three-hour drive from Damascus to Aleppo for an aid convoy now takes three days and passing through 54 checkpoints run by different people.  HEADLEE: Holy cow.  RICHARD: And so that's not an efficient way to get aid to people in need. What the world is doing is that we're seeing that the countries that provide aid year in and year out are doing it. In fact, the U.S. is the number one donor to this crisis. We've provided $1.3 billion in humanitarian assistance since the start of the conflict a couple years ago. And we're seeing Western Europe, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand also providing aid - the Europeans.  But what we want to see is more countries come to the table. Because of the scale and the scope of this crisis, we'd like to see more countries come and provide aid. One good news story is that Kuwait has done so. It has stepped forward and held a pledging conference last January. It committed $300 million. It followed through on its pledge. And it provided the funding through these multilateral organizations, UN agencies like the UN Refugee Agency, UNICEF, the World Food Program, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, among others. And there are some other states in the region - wealthy states in the region that have done some things. Like the United Arab Emirates has set up a camp inside Jordan. But we'd like to see more of that, more giving from the Gulf, more giving from Russia, from China, other members of the P5, as it's called...  HEADLEE: Right.  RICHARD: ...The five countries that make up the core of the UN Security Council.  HEADLEE: That's Anne Richard, assistant secretary for population, refugees and migration at the State Department. She was kind enough to join us here in our D.C. studios. Thank you so much, Anne.  RICHARD: Thank you.  Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR. All rights reserved.

Anti-American hardliners, Edbrink added, \"who feel their interests will be threatened\" if multinational talks lead to a resolution of the impasse over Iran's nuclear ambitions, packed Monday's demonstration with \"government workers and schoolkids.\"  He noted that hardliners are upset about the willingness of new President Hassan Rouhani and his aides to sit down with the U.S. and its partners. Iran wants a lifting of economic sanctions. The nations on the other side of the table want to make sure Iran does not join the list of nations with nuclear weapons.  Over the weekend, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a message that praised and defended the work of Iran's nuclear negotiators, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Istanbul. That would seem to be an endorsement of Rouhani's efforts.  But the ayatollah also lent some support to those who organized the \"death to America\" protest.

Egypt's military says it removed Morsi because of growing anger and public protests over how the nation's first democratically elected president and his Muslim Brotherhood supporters were governing.  Morsi's government, elected after the 2011 toppling of President Hosni Mubarak's regime, was in power for only about one year.  Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders have been under arrest for allegedly inciting violence that led to the deaths of Egyptians who protested against his government.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:  In Egypt, ousted president Mohammed Morsi appeared in public today for the first time since he was toppled and detained in a military coup in July. He was brought to court to face charges of inciting violence and murder. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, was defiant. He insisted that he is still the country's legitimate leader. He even refused to wear his prison jumpsuit.  His co-defendants - there are 14 of them - disrupted the proceedings with chants of down with military rule. The judge eventually ordered a recess until January. Morsi is in the same court where former Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, forced out by public protest in February, 2011, has face his own charges. Mubarak is under house arrest now.  NPR's Leila Fadel has left the courtroom and joins us now. Leila, good morning.  LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Good morning.  GREENE: So what was the scene like in there?  FADEL: For moments it was complete chaos. When Morsi walked into the courtroom, into the cage, the lawyers that were there in defense of him were flashing a sign that has become the symbol of where a sit-in were dispersed here, where hundreds have died. They called him the legitimate president as others called for his execution, some among them Egyptian journalists; others, police officers.  So there were moments where it was complete chaos as the defendants themselves screamed for the end of what they say is military rule, and called the court null and void, not legitimate.  GREENE: Now, you mentioned a cage. This is the situation in some countries where a defendant actually sits in a cage, sort of locked behind away from people and inside a courtroom.  FADEL: Yeah. Here in Egypt, every court has a prosecution cage where the defendant sits inside as judges discuss the case and the prosecution discusses the case, and the defense discusses the case. This particular courtroom was built for ousted autocrat Hosni Mubarak's trial. And now, Morsi, the first elected president who was ousted by a military coup popularly backed was in that courtroom today.  GREENE: Extraordinary, a toppled leader in the same cage, same place where another former leader was facing charges. I mean that says something about the situation in Egypt.  FADEL: That's true. But it's quite different circumstances and very interesting to watch. This is a country divided. It was a courtroom divided. Some saying: Down with military rule, others calling for the execution of Morsi as Morsi declared himself the president of the Republic of Egypt, defiantly, telling the judge he had no jurisdiction over him. And he still doesn't have a lawyer technically because he doesn't recognize the legitimacy of this court.  GREENE: OK, a chaotic scene. We have Morsi in this cage. Some people calling, as far as - I mean his execution which is quite dramatic. What was Morsi like? I mean he's been out of sight for four months now.  FADEL: Well, as you mentioned, he shows up in a business suit unlike the other defendants who are in white jumpsuits. It's something that a lot of the attorneys on the defense side were happy to see, that he was allowed to wear that, despite it being a criminal case. He was saying the same things he said before, that he was the legitimate president. And even though he hasn't been seen since July 3rd, he seemed OK. He doesn't look like he's been hurt or anything has happened to him in that way. And he seemed kind of defiant.  Prior to the beginning trial, the other defendants, the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, said that they had been treated badly. One, a leading member said he was kept in one cell for 60 days. The lawyers say that they have had no access to Morsi until they saw him today.  GREENE: Leila Fadel, let's remember the context here. The military said they removed Morsi under this popular outcry because, as they say, he abused his powers - that's their argument. His Muslim Brotherhood supporters note that he was democratically-elected. They say this was entirely illegal and undemocratic. I mean, is there a chance this trial will be fair in some way and resolve some of these questions?  FADEL: Well, the lawyers who were representing the victims of the violence - the violence they're accused of are killings outside of the presidential palace in December - they hope that it will be a straight criminal case. This is a case filed before Morsi's ouster. But in this political climate, there are questions whether this can be a fair trial. There are political aspirations behind it as well. And many feel that, really, he can't get a fair trial right now, when he's been ousted by the military, he's been kept incommunicado for months.  And so that's the real question. That's the real test. Will he have real access to lawyers? Will he be able to rebut the evidence? And that's still something that we'll have to see.  GREENE: We've been talking NPR's Leila Fadel who's in Cairo covering the trial of former President Mohamed Morsi. Leila, thanks a lot.  FADEL: Thank you.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  And I'm Steve Inskeep.  U.S. and Iranian negotiators are expected to meet again this week.  GREENE: The U.S. wants to resolve questions about Iran's nuclear program. Iran wants relief from American-led sanctions.  INSKEEP: People on both sides talk of easing decades of antagonism, but people in both countries also warn their leaders not to trust the other side. Domestic politics will influence how far both sides can go in diplomacy, as we will hear in this part of the program.  GREENE: Thirty-four years ago today, Iranians seized control of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. It's a traditional day of demonstrations in the country.  INSKEEP: Some conservatives there have declared this a Grand Day of Death to America - awkward in the midst of peace talks.  We go first to Thomas Erdbrink of The New York Times. He's in Tehran. Welcome back to the program.  THOMAS ERDBRINK: Thanks for having me.  INSKEEP: And I guess we should mention this death to America chant is constant at demonstrations in Iran, but here it is in a big way. What's different, if anything, about today?  ERDBRINK: Well, the Iranian hardliners who have organized today's demonstration decided that they wanted to make a point. So they brought in lots of people, people who are working in government offices but also lots of school kids. And they were all there right in front of me, shouting death to America a million times.  INSKEEP: And the fact that you are with an American newspaper, did they get upset at you particularly?  ERDBRINK: No, not at all. And actually all those people I spoke with told me privately that they didn't really mind Iran talking to the United States. And they admitted that they wanted to see some sort of solution for this long and bitter period of both countries not talking to each other. The majority of the people clearly is in favor of talks with the United States, but there is a very strong force in Iranian politics.  These are the hardliners that we're talking about - hardline Shiite Muslim clerics, military commanders who feel their interests will be threatened if there is any sort of rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. And they were the ones organizing this day and they were flexing their muscles.  INSKEEP: We've seen images of billboards over highways in Tehran showing an American and an Iranian at a negotiating table. And the image shows the American holding a gun under the table. Clearly this is more than just a single day of effort to raise suspicions about the United States.  ERDBRINK: Absolutely, and actually, the Tehran municipality took down the posters because they said were hung up without any proper permission. But today, during the rally, the posters were handed out by the hundreds. It's clear that the people behind this effort of, well, sabotaging the talks are influential, wealthy, and it's almost impossible for President Rouhani to silence them at this point.  INSKEEP: Let's remind people when you said President Rouhani, you're talking about Hasan Rouhani, the newly-elected president of Iran who campaigned for better relations with the rest of the world. But is there a sense that if the power structure is this skeptical, Thomas Erdbrink, that his time is somewhat limited here?  ERDBRINK: Well, it will definitely be very difficult for Mr. Rouhani, who made a lot of promises. And as you said, the main one being to improve relations with other countries when, at the same time, people in Tehran are shouting death to America, whereas he is engaged in what are Iran's most complicated diplomatic negotiations since the revolution 34 years ago. It is clear that all the changes he has promised might not bear fruit if he is not given more space by these hardliners.  INSKEEP: Even amid all these chants of death to America, though, isn't there a sense of optimism? We keep hearing about tourists coming back to Iran, about people being excited about visiting a country that maybe they left years ago.  ERDBRINK: Well, it's definitely true that after President Rouhani was elected in the surprise June elections, yes, a lot of the Iranian-Americans are coming back. Travel is picking up. But I don't know if that is an overall indication of the changes that Mr. Rouhani can actually make.  As I was driving to the demonstration this morning, the taxi driver who I've known for quite a while as being a very quiet man who never debates politics, he was very upset this morning. He said I don't understand our country anymore. On one hand, we are talking to the United States. On the other hand we are shouting death to America. To me as a simple man, he said of himself, it is clear that this will not lead to anything. He kind of said that he was very quickly losing his faith in President Rouhani and his ability to make the real big changes that he wanted, at least.  INSKEEP: Thomas Erdbrink of the New York Times, always a pleasure to talk with you.  ERDBRINK: Thank you for having me.  INSKEEP: He's in Tehran.  Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR. All rights reserved.

He says there's been only a trickle of U.S. aid to the secular, nationalist opposition in Syria, while the Islamists have no trouble raising money through their networks in the Arab world. \n \n\n \n \n\n \"They are very well-funded, they are well-equipped, they are highly trained, they are highly disciplined and highly motivated, and as a result, although their numbers are still small in comparison to the larger Free Syrian Army, they are the ones that are proving to be the most effective,\" Jouejati says. \"This is not good news for Syria, for the regional neighborhood or for the world.\" \n \n\n  Funding For Islamist Rebels  \n \n\n The Treasury Department says it's closely tracking the flow of money to al-Qaida-linked groups in Syria. Much of it comes from private sources, so it is hard to stop, says Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  \"The money is not coming from governments in the Gulf, it's coming from private citizens, and in particular, places like Kuwait,\" Zelin says.  Kuwait, Zelin says, has lax terrorism financing laws and many Salafis, who are ultraconservative Islamists, in parliament.  \"The Salafis have been able to gain a lot of power within the country over the last 10 years or so, and have been using their own charities to provide money and weapons to these different [Syrian] groups,\" he adds. The funders sometimes create shell organizations in southern Turkey that are used to deliver money to the rebels in Turkey or Syria.  The U.S. estimates that these fundraising networks have collected hundreds of millions of dollars in donations that end up in the hands of al-Qaida affiliates like the Jabhat al-Nusra or Nusra Front, which is on a U.S. terrorism blacklist, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which is waging war in both Syria and Iraq.  Social Media Impact  Former State Department official William McCants, who is now with the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution, says these groups carry out their fundraising campaigns through social media.  \"So if there's a big battle going on, they will have a hashtag that includes the name of the battle and then they will make a specific plea for assistance to go to the mujahids [holy warriors] who are fighting in Syria or they will make a more general pitch for aid, humanitarian aid,\" McCants says.  Once the money is gathered, it's wired to individuals, often in Turkey.  \"Those individuals will usually show up in a border town, pull out the money in cash and bring it across the border in suitcases and hand it over in cash to the groups,\" he says.  And there is a real impact on the ground, McCants says. While the U.S. wants the opposition to get more organized and united under the umbrella of the Supreme Military Council, the aid to that group has been slow to materialize while money flowing to extremists groups is driving rebel factions apart.  \"You read continually of groups that are aligned with the Supreme Military Council of running out of ammunition and not being able to pay their men,\" McCants says. \"So the private money going to these militias, the ultraconservative militias, are drawing in a lot of the young men just by virtue of having more cash on hand.\"  Support For Syria's Government  It's not just the jihadis who are able to raise funds easily in this conflict, says Fred Hof of the Atlantic Council.  \"The [Assad] regime on the other side is being supplied lavishly by both Russia and Iran,\" Hof says. \"It's the people in the middle who are not getting what they need.\"  The more moderate opposition fighters have had to hire a sanctions lawyer in Washington just to try to cut through U.S. regulations to try to get money and supplies to the groups the Obama administration says it supports.", "topics": [], "author": "Michele Kelemen, Morning Edition", "wordCount": 729}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "U.S. Drone Strike Rankles Pakistani Government", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=242736484&ft=1&f=1009", "text": "The Pakistani Taliban was forced to name a new leader after its chief, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone attack on Friday.

This morning, the Pakistani Taliban named an interim leader. They were forced to do so after their commander, a Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed by a U.S. drone strike Friday. Mehsud was buried by the Taliban early yesterday in northwest Pakistan. And later that day, the Pakistani government summoned the U.S. ambassador to protest Mehsud's killing.  U.S. drone strikes are, of course, a major issue for Pakistan. Just this past week, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was in Washington to reiterate his country's opposition to the U.S. policy of using targeted drones on its soil.  To hear more about all this, we reached Harris Khalique in Islamabad. He is a columnist for the Pakistani newspaper The News International. And we began by talking about the Pakistani Taliban as a force in Pakistan.  HARRIS KHALIQUE: Well, the Pakistani Taliban is actually quite a few groups who have come together in an umbrella organization. And they are waging war within Pakistan. And they, of course, have contacts elsewhere - I mean, in Afghanistan and in other countries, perhaps - and with, of course, Al-Qaida. And so it is sort of a loose alliance of different organizations. But they elect one leader.  MARTIN: The U.S. government has been after the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, for three years. The Pakistani government considered him an enemy. But yesterday, Pakistan's government called the strike counterproductive, to bringing peace and stability. What does that mean? Can you explain that?  KHALIQUE: Well, I mean there are multiple opinions here. I mean the government has come out and said that. However, many people in Pakistan still think that he was the enemy of the state, an enemy of people at large. However, the government sees it, you know, as a blow to the dialogue process they were trying to initiate for the past few weeks.  You know, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to the U.S. and his meeting with President Obama, I mean they were trying to pursue a dialogue process with the TTP. And they think that the drone attack is counterproductive because it will halt the process. The has yet to begin. But even the initiation of the process will get halted, according to the government now.  MARTIN: As we mentioned, this past week, the Pakistani prime minister met with President Obama. This was before Mehsud was killed by a U.S. drone strike. All reports of that meeting where that that - the conversation seemed to go pretty well. I wonder what this strike will mean. Will this drone strike mean another step backwards in the relationship between U.S. and Pakistan now?  KHALIQUE: There is a problem here. The problem is that drone strikes are seen as unlawful by many international bodies, as well as within Pakistan. However, the Taliban in Pakistan is also a defunct and unlawful outfit, according to the government.  So, you know, so it's more of - I mean I see it as something which is very confusing for the general populace because on the one hand, Hakimullah was seen as an enemy by the Pakistani establishment also but at the same time, in the past few weeks they were trying to speak to the outfit to bring a longer-term solution to the problem. But they were still unlawful. and the drone strikes are also seen as unlawful and breach of sovereignty of Pakistan.  MARTIN: Harris Khalique, he is a columnist for the Pakistani newspaper The News International. He joined us from Islamabad. Thanks so much for talking with us.  KHALIQUE: Thank you.

Majd and host Scott Simon discuss his new book, The Ministry of Guidance Invites You to Not Stay: An American Family in Iran . \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Hey honey, why don't we spend the year in Tehran? Well, that's kind of what Hooman Majd asked his wife, Karri, a yoga instructor who was born in the Midwest, not the Middle East. Mr. Majd was born into a politically prominent family in Iran. He came to the U.S. when he was eight months old. He became a music executive and a writer for GQ, The New Yorker and other publications.  Karri encouraged her husband to bring their young family, including their infant son, Khash, from the hipster confines of Brooklyn, where they lived, to spend a year in a place ruled by a theocracy with religious police, no free speech, security police and an un-hip pervasive threat of imprisonment. And a place which prohibits drinking and has no organic farmers' markets.  Hooman Majd, author of the previous book, \"The Ayatollah Begs to Differ,\" has written a book about his family's year in Tehran, \"The Ministry of Guidance Invites You to Not Stay.\" And Hooman Majd joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us.  HOOMAN MAJD: Oh, thank you for having me.  SIMON: May I ask you about everyday life in Iran, because you say at one point that the rules in Iran are guides, but meant to be broken?  MAJD: That's what Iranians believe. I don't think the government wants you to think that they're meant to be broken, although even as recently as just a month ago when the new president, Hassan Rouhani, was here, he kind of scoffed at the notion of Iranians aren't allowed to watch television broadcasts or be on the Internet. He said everyone has a satellite dish in Iran.  And that's true, so I think there's an acceptance of breaking the rules and I think in any kind of autocratic society there's an element of that, and it's been like that in Iran forever. Under the Shah it was the same thing. There were certain red lines you did not cross. Many of the things that I say or other Iranians might say comfortably in American would land us in jail if we said the same thing publicly in Iran.  SIMON: You mention one red line not to cross, which is criticizing the government. Others that you needed to learn about?  MAJD: Well, you can't criticize Islam or particularly Shia Islam; going against the regime itself, the Islamic republic as a system of government, and you can't criticize the supreme leader.  SIMON: You refer to an aspect of Iranian national character called the \"Big Sulk.\"  MAJD: Yes.  SIMON: Help us understand that.  MAJD: Well, it came out of my experience having just arrived in Tehran and the President of Iran deciding that he's going to go on this huge sulk and not go to work for 12 days 'cause he couldn't get his way. And it just reminded me of this personality quirk that we Iranians have of rather dramatic expressions of dissatisfaction and the drama that we like to inject into everything, including politics.  And even this new administration in Iran with the foreign minister falling down and saying: Oh my God, my back hurts and I can't work anymore because of all this pressure the hardliners putting me under. There's a history of that sulking and it's called gar(ph) in Farsi, where you just sort of like say I'm not going to talk to you, you know, you're going to have to beg me to come back to work.  SIMON: And the extent of life, everyday life that takes place behind closed doors...  MAJD: Yes, yes, yes. Well, everything happens really, I mean, everything interesting happens behind closed doors. You'll see people in restaurants, you'll see people shopping, but you don't see a very cheerful group of Iranians going about their daily business. People are rather dour, but once they get behind closed doors and they can be free to be who they are, you see a completely different Iranian, I think, because of the social restrictions today. That is how people entertain themselves.  SIMON: I was struck by a perception you had in the book where you say a lot of Iranians maybe be upset with their government over corruption or suppressing freedom of expression and dissent, and a lot of Iranians certainly fear the religious police, but you say that many still like the idea of Islamic law.  MAJD: Very few Iranians believe that Sharia Law, as we know it and as it is very strictly interpreted, should be applied all the time. But it's a religious country. And, you know, in the same way that many Americans believe in the Ten Commandments, many Iranians believe in the commandments of the Quran, even if they might break some of those commandments some of the time.  I would say that's true of, certainly, you know, the working class, certainly the religious classes. You know, again, I can't tell you what the numbers are and polls are inaccurate in Iran, but there is that segment of the population and it is rather large.  SIMON: You related to former president Khatami.  MAJD: Yes.  SIMON: And he tells you over tea one day that a lot of Iranians want human rights and democracy but don't have the culture for it...  MAJD: Yeah.  SIMON: ...which means what?  MAJD: Even though most Iranians profess to want democracy, even though most Iranians want human rights, the political culture of Iran is immature and it's partly immature because of the obstacles that have been put in its way, some of which are the fault of the Islamic Republic, some of which are the fault of the Westerners. Just as an example, when you have the West constantly saying all options are on the table for dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue - in other words, we can potentially go to war or bomb Iran if Iran doesn't do what we say, you have a culture created inside the political system which says we are under the threat of attacks so we can't allow the kind of freedom that we would like to allow, even among certain liberal politicians in Iran.  It's a difficult question to answer and I'm not sure I have the answers, but I certainly think that many of the Iranian reformists who have tried to bring about change in Iran have been dismayed by the lack of movement and the lack of support, even, in some cases, of the people for change. And I think that's where the question really is, is the culture ready for it?  SIMON: Hooman Majd, his new book, \"The Ministry of Guidance Invites You to Not Stay.\" Thanks so much for being with us.  MAJD: Thank you very much.

Aid agencies sometimes have to negotiate with rebel groups and work in dangerous situations to immunize vulnerable children. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n  Omar Sanadiki / AP \n \n In a refugee camp in eastern Lebanon, aid workers put sandbags around plastic tents to keep winter rains from flooding dirt floors. For weeks now, the threat for Syrian refugees was the coming cold. Now refugees have a bigger fear: polio.  A childhood disease that causes paralysis and sometimes death, polio can spread rapidly, especially with the huge movement of people fleeing the war.  Some 4,000 Syrians still cross into neighboring countries every day, at least half of them children.  Lebanon hasn't had a polio outbreak in 12 years. The announcement of 10 confirmed cases in eastern Syria is a wake-up call for the region, one that requires a regional response by health workers and aid agencies, says Dr. Foaud Foaud, professor of health services at Amerian University Beirut.  \"I think it's not about just 'fast enough,' they should be 'wide enough,'\" Foaud says as Syrian refugees stream into neighboring Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. \"They have to reach now five countries ... It's not easy at all. it's very difficult, but it's a must, now.\"  In Lebanon, health officials are sending out 5,000 workers for door-to-door immunizations. This weekend, a center is opening at the airport and at the border to immunize young children as they arrive.  In Syria, the government launched an immunization campaign as soon as the first polio cases were reported.  UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, is a key agency supporting the immunization program. UNICEF organized a vaccine airlift that arrived in Beirut and will be trucked into Syria.  An immediate focus is the eastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor, where the outbreak was first reported, says Juliette Touma, regional spokesperson for UNICEF.  \"In the past few days we managed to reach, at UNICEF, with partners, more than 40,000 children in Deir Ezzor, where the polio cases were confirmed,\" Touma says. \"This is only the beginning.\"  The goal is to reach 1.6 million children across Syria, an enormous challenge in wartime, she says. To reach the most vulnerable children, aid agencies have to negotiate not just with the government, but with rebel groups, to allow them to work in areas they hold or surround. \n \n\n \"The challenges are huge,\" says Touma. \"Our staff has to cross sometimes over 50 check points. It's a huge risk to reach people in need.\"  Rebels present another challenge: Some are foreign fighters. Health officials strongly suspect that the virus that infected Syrian children could have come from Pakistan, Foaud says.  That's a tragedy, he says; polio was eradicated in Syria 14 years ago. Syria was the first country in the Arab world to introduce mass immunization.  \"So we are facing now strange people fighting in Syria,\" Foaud says. \"We're seeing strange diseases that we thought were finished. It means now, it's a collapsed system. So, no one wants to say it's a failed state, but at least in some part, it is.\"", "topics": [], "author": "Deborah Amos, Rima Marrouch", "wordCount": 515}, {"date": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Mash Donalds?

Middle East analyst Holly Dagres is on a hunt for fast-food lookalikes in Tehran.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Iran may not love America politically, but Iranians love American food \u2014 especially fast food.  With no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, though, it's rather hard to find a McDonald's or a Pizza Hut. But if you wander through the streets of Tehran, you might find a Pizza Hat or a Mash Donald's.  The rise of the \"fake franchise\" caught the attention of Iranian-American Holly Dagres , a Middle East analyst and commentator, who travels to Tehran often from her home in Cairo. She published a photo essay on BuzzFeed in October highlighting some of these eateries. \n \n\n Dagres tells NPR's Scott Simon she has counted nine so far that look familiar: Baskin-Robbins, Chipotle, Domino's Pizza, KFC, Mash Donald's, Pizza Hat, Raees Coffee, Subway and Super Star.  Raees Coffee is actually a replica of Starbucks, and Super Star is inspired by Carl's Jr. in the U.S., she says.  But these stores have nothing to do with the American franchises.  \"I think Starbucks actually tried to sue Raees Coffee, but there was no success; and the same with KFC,\" says Dagres. \"And they've done such a perfect job, in some circumstances, of emulating things. Baskin-Robbins and KFC look like the real deal. It's kind of confusing.\"  At Baskin-Robbins, for example, Dagres says you have the 31 flavors, with the same cups and spoons. But the quality of ice cream might be better because, in fact, it's Italian gelato.  If diplomatic relations were ever restored, would those faux franchises be in a difficult position?  Dagres says there would be lawsuits. \"They might have to shut down, but I think it would be sad for the owners of those companies,\" she says. \"These are just individuals that came up with a bright idea and thought it would be great to emulate American franchises.\"  We had to ask Dagres where she'd take us for lunch if we were in Tehran today.  \"Since you're American, I wouldn't take you to a bootleg franchise,\" she says. \"I'd take you for some really good kebab. But if you were really craving something American, I would take you to Super Star. And the only reason I say that is because it was my high school hangout, and I love their chicken burger.", "topics": [], "author": "NPR Staff, Weekend Edition Saturday", "wordCount": 410}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Iraqi Foreign Minister: We Need American Help", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=242412311&ft=1&f=1009", "text": "Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki will meet with President Obama Friday, and is expected to ask for more and stronger military aid.

The prime minister of Iraq is in Washington today, in part seeking military assistance. Coordinated terror bombings have risen sharply in his country, and the old group al-Qaida in Iraq, with a new name, is reported to be active in Syria. They're one of the radical Islamist groups fighting against the Assad regime there.  Iraq lies between Syria and Iran. Its prime minister is the Shiite politician Nouri al-Maliki. Joining us is the foreign minister of Iraq, Hoshyar Zebari, who has accompanied Prime Minister Maliki on this visit to Washington. Welcome to the program.  HOSHYAR ZEBARI: Thank you. Thank you.  SIEGEL: Let's start with a request for military hardware for counter-terrorism. Some American senators say the most important thing Prime Minister Maliki could do to lessen sectarian violence would be to invite more participation by Sunni Muslims and also rein in some of the extremist Shiite groups who would oppose that invitation. Is that welcome advice or American meddling?  ZEBARI: No. We welcome the advice of all American friends. And here we have a common interest with the United States. We consider ourself to be an ally and a friend to the United States. And we have a pressing security problem. We have a capacity problem. We need American help. This is the message we've come to Washington.  SIEGEL: One of the specific suggestions about reaching out to Sunni Muslims has been to engage more Sunni fighters into the Iraqi army.  ZEBARI: Yes.  SIEGEL: Is that one of the steps that we could expect?  ZEBARI: This is one of the - our plans, actually, to accelerate before the Sunni fighters from the Son of Iraq or the Awakening forces played a crucial role...  SIEGEL: These are militias in the (unintelligible) area...  ZEBARI: ...in defeating al-Qaida. Al-Qaida has now resurged in Iraq, and it is a mortal threat to Iraq and to the United States and to the countries of the region. That's why we really support enhancing security cooperation with the United States, with other neighboring countries to defeat this terrorist network.  SIEGEL: What do you say, though, to Americans, Foreign Minister Zebari, who say you're coming here for help. You had a lot of help from the U.S. In fact, Prime Minister Maliki changed positions, yielded to a popular Iraqi position for the U.S. to get out of Iraq and not retain people who would've been there to help you at this point.  ZEBARI: We negotiated jointly. And I negotiated that, too, on behalf of the government for the U.S. troops withdrawal from Iraq after helping the Iraqi to establish a democratic system and to remove the regime of Saddam Hussein and dictatorship. And after that, there was a common willingness here in America and in Iraq that Iraqi security forces have developed a certain level. But in fact, we are bound with the United States with another far more important agreement, which is the Strategic Framework Agreement, that is longer than the SOFA that we ended and negotiated...  SIEGEL: SOFA being the Status of Forces Agreement.  ZEBARI: That's correct.  SIEGEL: Standing for that, yeah.  ZEBARI: Yes. And so we are trying to develop this Strategic Framework Agreement in many areas of mutual interest, economic fields, education and security. And we are here really to call upon our allies, our friends in Washington not to leave Iraq to its own fate, to help, to assist especially...  SIEGEL: But you understand the irony that the message a couple of years ago was please leave us to our own fate or start leaving us to our own fate.  ZEBARI: No, I think it was a common willingness, not from the Iraqi, from the American public also. They were tired. They were fed up of American troops being involved in wars outside the United States. But now, actually, when American troops withdraw from Iraq, the United States did not withdraw its interest in Iraq or in the region.  SIEGEL: Yesterday, a senior American official was asked by a reporter if Washington is satisfied with what Iraq is doing to halt arms shipments over Iraqi airspace from Iran to Syria, arms for the Assad regime. The answer was we'd like them to do more.  ZEBARI: Yes.  SIEGEL: Will Iraq do more, and if so, what will you do?  ZEBARI: We will do more, definitely. Iraq's position is not supporting the Assad regime at all, contrary to the perceptions. And also, we are not party to the conflict, in fact, in Syria. We tried to play a constructive role to reach a political settlement to support Geneva II peace process. Yesterday, I had a good meeting with Secretary Kerry, and we discussed about the upcoming development in pushing all the Syrian parties, let's say, to the negotiating table.  On halting the flights or suspected arm flights from Iran to Syria over Iraqi airspace, believe me, it's a question of capacity, of ability. Iraq doesn't have, as we speak, a single fighter plane. Iraq doesn't have an integrated defense system that...  SIEGEL: If you had fighter planes, would they intercept Iranian planes flying over the north of Iraq?  ZEBARI: I believe so. I believe so. We have given them the marshes - I personally have reached out to them and asked them really not to misuse our territory, our airspace for any arm shipments because this is contrary to our policy. But you need to reinforce that, you see, with some capacity. We don't have that.  SIEGEL: It is now commonly observed that with the election of Prime Minister Maliki and the empowerment of Shiite Muslims in Iraq that there's been a huge power shift in the region that favors Shiite Iran and that worries Sunni countries like Saudi Arabia. Whether the Saudis should be worried or not, is it fair to observe that there has been such a shift?  ZEBARI: I think it was in the best interest of Saudi Arabia and other countries to reach out to the new Iraq. Yes, the Shiite power has risen in Iraq as a result of the democratic election and the majority rule. But at the same time, this would not be at the expense of other communities in Iraq, whether the Sunnis or the Kurds. And the new government, actually, is one - an inclusive government is a partnership government where all the communities participate. Iraq has no problems with Saudi Arabia or with its neighboring countries. In fact, we now have nearly over 90 diplomatic missions in Baghdad, including 17 Arab countries...  SIEGEL: But the Saudis seem to think that the war handed in Iraq over from a Sunni-led Saddam Hussein regime to the current regime, which they see as a Shiite regime.  ZEBARI: I think it's a simplification. It was Saddam Hussein who invaded Kuwait, who threatened Saudi Arabia in the past, as we know the history very well. But Iraq sees itself that it has a vital national interest to be integrated in the region, in the Arab world, in the Middle East and to be a force for good.  SIEGEL: That's Hoshyar Zebari, the foreign minister of Iraq. Minister Zebari, it's good to see you again. Thank you.  ZEBARI: Great seeing you. Thank you.  Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

He is seen as one of the most liberal mayoral candidates in decades. \n   Under Mr Bloomberg, Mr Lhota ran the city's public transport authority.

Mr Obama, a Democrat, won the state in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. \n   The results of Tuesday's elections could prove an early measure of the parties' support in 2014, in which voters will decide the make-up of the House of Representatives, one-third of the Senate, and the governorships in more than half the states. \n   In Washington, Mr Obama's Democratic Party controls the Senate, while the Republicans control the House of Representatives.

However, its population is only about one-fifth of Russia's. \n   Nearly 90% of Canadians live within 200km of the border with the United States, which means that Canada contains vast expanses of wilderness to the north. \n   The relationship to its powerful neighbour is a defining factor for Canada. The US and Canada are both each other's largest trading partner. \n   The North American Free Trade Agreement, involving Canada, the US and Mexico, has brought a trade boom for Canada. But thorny issues abound. American moves which impact on Canadian exports, in the form of tariffs on Canadian timber and increased subsidies for US farmers, have created particular tension. \n \n Vancouver rates as one of the world's most liveable cities \n \n  Canada is also worried about pollution from US factories near the border, and about the possible impact on the environment of the exploitation of oil deposits in Alaska. \n   Canada pursues a foreign policy that is distinct from that of the US. The country has committed troops to the American-led war on terror, but does not back the US trade embargo on Cuba. Canada did not send troops to join the US-led war in Iraq. \n   After the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, the challenge of securing the 9,000-km Canada-US border from possible terrorist infiltration prompted both countries to look at ways of sharing information. \n Immigration \n\t  Immigration has helped to make Canada one of the world's richest nations. Challenges related to discrimination and integration are gaining increasing attention. Many recent newcomers hail from Asia. Canada's indigenous peoples make up less than two per cent of the population. The way in which provincial governments share land and natural resources with native groups is an ongoing issue. \n   Separatist aspirations in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec have been a major domestic issue. A referendum in 1995 saw advocates of an independent Quebec only narrowly defeated. \n   Subsequent opinion polls indicated a fall in support for independence and the pro-independence Parti Quebecois was defeated in 2003's provincial election, but regained power in 2012. In a largely symbolic move, parliament in 2006 agreed that the Quebecois should be considered a \"nation\" within a united Canada. \n   Canada has been asserting its sovereignty in the Arctic with growing vigour and has become embroiled in territorial spats with the US and Denmark.

The US saw the island as a strategic asset and ran it as a colonial protectorate. \n   Under American administration Puerto Rico saw growth and development. But nationalist sentiment sometimes spilled over into violence, notably in the 1930s and 1940s. Nationalists staged an armed attack in the US Congress in 1954. \n \n Historic San Juan is made up of colonial homes and cobbled streets \n \n  A series of bombings and killings in the 1970s and 1980s were blamed on a pro-independence group, the Macheteros, or Cane Cutters. The group's fugitive leader was killed by federal agents in 2005. \n   Puerto Ricans voted in a November 2012 referendum for full membership of the United States as the 51st State. Any constitutional change requires approval by the US Congress and president. President Barack Obama has already indicated that he will respect the Puerto Rican decision, and has called on Congress to take steps in that direction. \n   Puerto Rican voters, who elect a governor for the island, have tended to favour parties that support the union with the US. Puerto Ricans do not pay US income tax, and the island receives federal funds. \n   There is an established cycle of migration between Puerto Rico and the US; hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have lived and worked in New York and other cities. \n   The once substantial US military presence has been scaled down with the closures of a major naval base and a bombing range.

Slaves were brought to the island in the 16th and 17th centuries. \n   Puerto Rico's landscape is varied, and includes rainforests in the north-east.

The territory capitalises on its image as \"France in North America\". \n \n A fisherman's cottage on the archipelago of St Pierre and Miquelon \n \n  The fishing industry was badly hit by disputes with Canada from the late 1970s over quotas and territorial waters, and by a later moratorium on cod fishing. In 1992 a tribunal awarded an economic zone to St Pierre and Miquelon that was less than 25% of the area claimed by France. \n   At its peak the fishery attracted hundreds of vessels from Europe every year, spawning a ship supply and repair industry. \n   After periods of French and British rule and frequent skirmishes between the two, the territory was restored to France in 1816. It became a French department in 1976. This was unpopular; many islanders said European integration did not take into account their remoteness. \n   The islands became a French \"territorial collectivity\" in 1985. The status - something between a department and an overseas territory - allowed French subsidies to continue and calmed Canadian fears about European exploitation of its fishing grounds. \n   The territory enjoyed a windfall in the prohibition era of the 1920s, when the US banned the production and sale of alcoholic drinks. It became a centre for shipping whisky, wine and rum to the US. But the end of prohibition in 1933 plunged the islands into economic depression. \n   Fish stocks in the seas around the islands attracted the first Europeans.

The constitution, drafted in 1787, established a federal system with a division of powers which has remained unchanged in form since its inception. \n \n Early settlers arrived in ships such as this replica of the Dutch vessel Half Moon. People from all over the globe still try make the US their home \n \n  The US contains a highly diverse population, the product of numerous and sustained waves of immigration. Ethnic and racial diversity - the \"melting pot\" - is celebrated as a core element of the American ideology. \n   The 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed racial and other discrimination, but race continues to be a live issue. \n   The election of Barack Obama as the country's first African-American president in November 2008 marked a defining moment in the country's chequered history of race relations. \n Decline of the natives \n\t  The original people of north America, who made up several distinct groups of native Americans, went into decline with the arrival of settlers and now constitute a minority of the population. \n   The early settlers came predominantly from the British Isles. Large numbers of black Africans were taken as slaves to work the plantations of the Americas, while millions of Europeans in search of political freedom and economic opportunity constituted a third stage of immigration. \n \n The US flexes its military muscle throughout the world; unconventional forces are probably its most challenging adversaries \n \n  Today, Asians from the Pacific rim and Hispanics from the southern Americas are among those seeking what their predecessors wanted - the promise of prosperity and freedom which remains one of the defining hallmarks of \"the American dream\". \n   Despite relative prosperity in recent years, the gap between rich and poor remains a major challenge. More than 30 million Americans live below the official poverty line, with a disproportionate percentage of these being African-Americans and Hispanics. \n   Furthermore, the global financial crisis of 2008 has left the US facing its most challenging set of economic circumstances since the Great Depression of the 1930s. \n 9/11 aftermath \n\t \n Millions of Americans live in poverty \n \n  The terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 had a momentous impact as the country continued to re-define its role as the world's only superpower. \n   In October 2001 the US led a military campaign in Afghanistan that unseated the Taleban regime. However, the man who ordered the 9/11 attacks, Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, survived until 2011, when killed in a US special forces operation in Pakistan. \n   In March 2003 Washington initiated military action in Iraq which led to the toppling of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. \n   US foreign policy has often mixed the idealism of its \"mission\" to spread democracy with the pursuit of national self-interest. \n   Given America's leading role on the international stage, its foreign policy aims and actions are likely to remain the subject of heated debate and criticism, as well as praise. \n \n New York's Manhattan is a global commercial and cultural centre", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 576}, {"date": null, "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "VIDEO: What can Big Apple do with Big Data?", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24813181#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "5 November 2013 Last updated at 00:03 GMT  New York City officials collect an extraordinary amount of data, ranging from information about parking meters to phone calls to a city-run help line.

So why does it matter to anyone else? \n   Only one in three people voted when Republican Bob McDonnell became Virginia's 71st governor in 2009. That's fewer than two million people. \n   So the contest to become his successor might not seem like a battle of national, even international, importance. \n   But the result of Tuesday's election - between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli - will have implications far beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains and Chesapeake Bay. \n   It's a key swing state, closely contested in presidential elections, but it's a different electorate who make the effort to vote in these kinds of elections. In fact, for 36 years, whichever political party holds the White House has lost the governor's seat a year later. \n   There's a theory that presidential candidates are at an advantage when campaigning in a state with a friendly governor, but it didn't help Mitt Romney win the state in 2012. So why is this election important? \n   1 . It could shape Republican identity \n   In Virginia, the Republicans have put forward a candidate closely allied to the Tea Party, the group that other members of the party have blamed for the recent government shutdown. \n   National Republicans should be really worried if McAuliffe wins, says Craig Brians, professor of political science at Virginia Tech. \n   \"They could be thinking: 'This is perhaps the second time in a month that people associated with the Tea Party have really hurt us and we need to rethink things.' \n   \"At some point, the national Republican party needs to decide: 'Are we going to be a majority party or go to the right, stake out that ground and maybe never hold national office again.'\" \n   2 . There's a Hillary factor \n \n \n  Both Clintons have helped McAuliffe, who was co-chairman of the former president's re-election campaign and chairman of his wife's 2008 presidential campaign. \n   \"Terry McAuliffe is a really old friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton so the fact that they would come and help him campaign is not surprising. But they are not super popular in Virginia so the fact he brought them here is interesting, in the sense that Hillary is keeping her hand in, simply by being part of it and keeping her face in it.\" \n   With Hillary braced to run in 2016, a McAuliffe win would be interpreted as a boost for her, he adds, because such a divisive figure inflicted no fundamental damage to his campaign. \n   Writing in the National Review , conservative blogger Jim Geraghty goes even further and suggests it's been a dry run for the Hillary campaign machine. \n   3 . It's what the US is going to look like \n   The demographics in Virginia are changing in the same way as they are across the country - a growing Hispanic and Asian population, and more people in urban areas. \n   \"It's a microcosm of what's happening nationally,\" says Dustin Cable of the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, especially in southern cities like Atlanta and Raleigh. \n   The northern Virginia suburbs are a Mecca for young college-educated professionals, he says, many of them federal employees working in Washington DC. \n   These groups have helped Obama win two elections but it's not yet clear how these shifts will play out in elections that historically have older, white voters, says Cable. \n   4 . Effects on Obamacare \n   Supporters and opponents of the highly controversial Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature law that aims to extend health insurance coverage, will be watching Virginia. \n   Cuccinelli has led the battle against Obamacare in the state, says Brians. If he fails, people could infer that voters in Virginia are in favour of Obamacare. \n   The present governor, Republican Bob McDonnell, has said no to expanding Medicaid and no to running a state insurance exchange. McAuliffe has said he will reverse both those if he wins. \n   \"That will make a huge difference in one of the biggest issues of the campaign,\" says Brians. \n   5 .

But alas, stuck in front of your computer screen, you can't join them. \n   Except now you can - if you're a fan of American musician Beck, that is. \n   He is one of a few artists making interactive music videos requiring fan participation. \n   Throughout his 20-year career the industry has seen many changes, including more people now watching music videos on YouTube than on MTV. \n   Beck has made many memorable music videos, though he started out with limited means. \n   \"[For] my first video we had no money,\" he says. \"I had a friend who had film in the freezer left over from film school and we used that one roll of film. \n   \"Every frame was precious.\" \n   The video in question was for his hit song Loser , which went on to sell half a million copies and became one of the defining singles of the 1990s. \n Join Beck on stage \n\t  \"I was surprised when some of these videos actually got played,\" he continues about his early releases. \n   \"Most of them were just friends who were making them and editing them.\" \n   Since then the 43-year-old has collaborated with acclaimed directors such as Spike Jonze and Michael Gondry on his music videos. \n   Earlier this year he took this one step further, developing a 360 degree experience with director Chris Milk. \n   In Hello Again viewers can join Beck onstage or stroll around among the 170 musicians as they play David Bowie's Sound and Vision. \n \n Hello Again allows viewers to join Beck in the auditorium and to move around as though they were present at the concert \n \n  Viewers move around by turning on their computer's webcam and moving their heads in the direction they want to move in. \n Coming to life \n\t  For Beck, music videos can create a strong connection between bands and fans in the digital age. \n   \"I grew up in an era where the packaging was such a big part of how you related to the music,\" he says. \n   The cover of Psychocandy , the first Jesus and Mary Chain album, which has a bold design and stark red, white and black colour scheme, had an especially strong influence on how he related to the band and came to understand them. \n   \"It gave me enough information, it opened up a whole idea about where this music is coming from and what it was.\" \n   He believes music videos can fulfil this role in today's digital era where there is less emphasis on physical records. \n   \"I felt that they were album artwork come to life,\" he says about these videos. \n Creating bonds \n\t  The Google Creative Lab's Aaron Koblin has directed several interactive music videos. \n   The 31-year-old heads the data arts team and grew up in the era of big budget videos which played a large role in teen culture, but says the fan was passive. \n   \"When I used to watch music videos it was very much 'I am receiving the content which is helping me understand and create a picture of the musician's identity',\" he says. \"But it didn't necessarily make me feel all that much closer.\" \n   He thinks interactive web-based videos enable a new way of creating that bond. \n \n Arcade Fire have released several interactive music videos requiring fan participation \n \n  He has worked with Arcade Fire on videos that require fans to interact with the band. \n   \"I hope we can create a deeper emotional experience which will then help bring a better connection,\" he says. \n   Together with director Vincent Morisset, he aimed to do just that with the Just A Reflektor project, which uses the title track from Arcade Fire's latest album. \n   Fans connect their smartphone to their webcam via a unique code on the video's site. \n   By moving their smartphone around viewers can change the visual effects on the video, creating sprinkles of light and colour. They also can guide the protagonist on her journey and eventually join her. \n   \"Your phone and computer are actually talking to each other,\" Mr Koblin says. \n   \"The computer is observing and talking about the phone's location and movement and in doing that is able to construct and change the story based around the way the phone is being moved around.\" \n Continue reading the main story \n \n\t \n Just A Reflektor was recorded in Haiti and uses the title track of Arcade Fire's latest album \n \n \n Director Vincent Morisset (front, centre) and creative director Aaron Koblin (far right) aimed to allow viewers to control the focus and effects of the video \n \n \n By gesturing to a webcam with a smartphone viewers can change the visual effects, for example by throwing light on to the video from different angles \n \n \n The smartphone can be moved around to create different types of effect \n \n \n Created as an experiment for Google Chrome the team has released the code and tools created to make the video \n \n Continue reading the main story \t \n\t \n\t\t previous slide \n\t\t next slide \n\t\t \n\t \n \n Not easy \n\t  While videos are increasingly being viewed on the internet, interactive web-based ones are still rare. \n   Just A Reflektor uses new code and tools and was specifically created for the Google Chrome browser. \n   \"These things aren't that easy to make yet,\" Mr Koblin explains. \n   \"That's part of why when we create them we're releasing a lot of the code that we used and a lot of the tools that we created so we can encourage other people to get involved.\" \n   Arcade Fire have tried the interactive experience before in another experiment for Google Chrome. \n   The song We Used To Wait was used by Mr Koblin and Mr Milk to become the interactive experience The Wilderness Downtown , which uses Google Earth to bring a new dimension to the song. \n   Viewers type in their home address and will see images of where they grew up within the video. \n   Jordan Gauthier is an Arcade Fire fan and says their interactive videos have strengthened his relationship with the band. \n   He grew up in the French suburban town of Rennes and says The Wilderness Downtown made him relate to the song in a new way by helping him recall his childhood memories. \n   \"It's like putting your own memories into the video,\" he says. \"I thought that was amazing.\" \n Infinite possibilities \n\t \n The Johnny Cash Project is crowdsourced and made up of stills drawn by fans \n \n  Ultimately Beck thinks the web opens up numerous possibilities to interact with fans. \n   \"I think that's an infinite idea,\" he says. \"That kind of idea is going to spread because the technology exists.\" \n   He points to the success of crowdfunding in other fields and thinks more videos will source their ideas and materials from fans in the future. \n   Mr Koblin and Mr Milk crowdsourced for The Johnny Cash Project , which features the song Ain't No Grave. \n   Released after Cash's death, the interactive site pays tribute to him through a video made up of stills drawn by fans. \n   Viewers can then select and watch the frames in different orders. As material is continuously being added to the project, every viewing is unique. \n \n The Johnny Cash Project includes some realistic stills and more abstract renditions, and fans can choose to watch the video depending on these styles \n \n Frankenstein videos \n\t  Crowdsourcing can also build closer bonds between fans themselves, according to British director Ninian Doff. \n   He crowdsourced images of fans dancing to make the video for Graham Coxon's What It'll Take . \n   One hundred fans sent in videos from 28 countries, and Mr Doff cut up all the videos for the final piece. \n   \"It's a big jumble,\" he explains. \n   \"Sometimes it's one person's legs and another person's top half, or it's one person's legs, one person's body, one person's head. \n   \"It's like making a Frankenstein out of fans' bodies.\" \n \n Monster creation: The video for What It'll Take features body parts of 100 fans, crowdsourced by the director \n \n  And people managed to find themselves and each other through leaving comments about the video online. \n   \"One person commented saying, 'Oh that's me at 2 minutes 5 seconds',\" Mr Doff says. \"Then another person replied, 'I'm your legs at 2 minutes 5 seconds'. \n   \"They'd managed to meet over the internet through being connected in the video.\"", "topics": [], "author": "Nastaran Tavakoli-Far", "wordCount": 1394}, {"date": "2013-11-03 19:32:00", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "The Wall Street boss glad she was sacked", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24525479#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "Sallie Krawcheck wants to see more women in top financial jobs \n \n      Sallie Krawcheck used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street - before two very public sackings at the height of the financial collapse. \n   Now the head of women's networking organisation 85 Broads, she says she's grateful she was fired. \n   From 2007-2011, Ms Krawcheck held prominent roles at banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. \n   Those positions made her, arguably, the highest ranking woman on Wall Street. \n   But, at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, she had very public clashes with Vikram Pandit, the then chief executive of Citigroup, over her insistence that the bank should repay investors who had lost money using defective financial instruments that Citi had created. \n   Eventually, she was forced out - a fate that would once again befall her, just a few years later, after taking on the role of chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America. \n   Although those firings certainly stung, they gave Ms Krawcheck an epiphany - in times of distress, companies react by closing ranks, and diversity, particularly gender diversity, suffers. \n   \"What I saw a thousand times during the downturn was, 'We'd like to give her that opportunity, but we need to go with the sure thing - we can't afford diversity right now,'\" she says. \n   So now, as the boss of 85 Broads, Ms Krawcheck says her goal is to work in a more active way to correct the gender balance at the top. \n 'Invest in women' \n\t  Ms Krawcheck bought 85 Broads for an undisclosed fee from its founder, Janet Hanson, in May. \n   Created by a group of women who worked at Goldman Sachs' former headquarters at 85 Broad Street, it was initially created to mentor women in the bank. Now, it's exploded to a membership organisation with more than 30,000 paid subscribers from 130 countries. \n \n 85 Broads is a networking organisation for professional women \n \n  Ms Krawcheck is candid in acknowledging that her purchase surprised many people. \n   \"For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way,\" she wrote in a post announcing her purchase. \n   \"My standard response: 'Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I'm just focused on getting the job done.'\" \n   However, she says her first job - as a research analyst at Solomon Brothers in the 1980s - taught her to invest in what is supported by research. \n   And she says research shows that \"women are a phenomenal investment and that is true in almost any way you can define it\". \n \n Ms Krawcheck says being fired gave her a new outlook \n \n  Ms Krawcheck cites data showing that companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity. \n   However, despite those statistics, she thinks that gender diversity - particularly in the financial services industry - has stalled, mostly as a result of the fallout from the financial crisis. \n 'Talked at' \n\t  \"During periods of stress, it's easier for all of us to be with people like ourselves,\" she says about Wall Street's behaviour during that time. \n   \"But eventually it becomes a shortcut.\" \n   She thinks that as a result of this impulse to push out outsiders, bad decisions can often get made. \n   \"What I saw was a good deal of groupthink [during the financial collapse],\" she says. \"The same people, same types of backgrounds, looking at the same data coming to the same conclusion - which in this case was wrong.\" \n   During that time, she adds, she was \"talked at\" a couple of times - but not necessarily listened to. \n   She says that her goal at 85 Broads is to listen to the membership to figure out ways to convince Wall Street bosses and other large organisations that gender diversity is crucial to their success - that in times of stress, instead of closing ranks, companies should look for an outsider perspective. \n   Furthermore, she wants to expand the mission of 85 Broads to invest in companies helmed by some of its members or by other powerful women. \n 'Ups and downs' \n\t  Ms Krawcheck is candid that while her two firings helped her crystallise what she wanted to do as an executive, it certainly wasn't easy to fall so swiftly, twice. \n   \"In my mind, I sat on my sofa in my sweatpants for nine months and waited for the phone to ring,\" says Ms Krawcheck, about the time after she was sacked by Citigroup. \n   But she says she is grateful for both the highs - and the lows. \n   \"I've a lot of ups and some downs and people have asked about how I've weathered them,\" she says. \n   \"I know for a lot of entrepreneurs there's a sense of optimism [in being boss of your own company].

But government snooping is nothing new. \n   Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote in his famous treatise The Art of War: \"Enlightened rulers and good generals who are able to obtain intelligent agents as spies are certain for great achievements.\" \n   Purloined letters, intercepted communications, official eavesdropping - here are some examples of spying over the ages, by enlightened rulers and not-so-enlightened ones. \n Caesar's spies \n\t  In Ancient Rome, major political players had their own surveillance networks, which provided them with information about the schemes of those in power. \n \n An extensive spy network couldn't save Julius Caesar \n \n  Politician and orator Cicero frequently lamented that his letters were being intercepted. \n   \"I cannot find a faithful message-bearer,\" he wrote to his friend, the scholar Atticus. \"How few are they who are able to carry a rather weighty letter without lightening it by reading.\" \n   Julius Caesar put together an elaborate spy network to keep himself apprised of the various plots against him. In fact, Caesar may have known about the Senate-led conspiracy that culminated in his assassination. \n   Even the best spy network sometimes cannot stop a dagger. \n   In the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church was more powerful than most governments - and it had a powerful surveillance network to match. \n   French Bishop Bernard Gui was a noted author and one of the leading architects of the Inquisition in the late 13th and early 14th Centuries. For 15 years, he served as head inquisitor of Toulouse, where he convicted more than 900 individuals of heresy. \n   A noted author and historian, Gui was best known for the Conduct of the Inquisition into Heretical Depravity, written in 1323-24, in which he outlined the means for identifying, interrogating and punishing heretics. \n   The court of Elizabeth I was fertile ground for scheming and spies, and Francis Walsingham's job was to keep the monarch one step ahead of her adversaries. \n   In May 1582, Walsingham intercepted letters written by Spanish ambassador to England, Bernardino de Mendoza, regarding a conspiracy to invade England and install Mary, Queen of Scots to the throne. \n   While Mary was confined to Chartley Manor, Walsingham came up with a way to prove she was a threat to the queen. He had most of her mail opened, but led her to believe that she had a secret means of correspondence through letters hidden in a beer keg. \n   Walsingham gathered evidence of Mary's involvement in rebellious plots. She was put on trial for treason and beheaded. \n Robespierre's watchmen \n\t  Mary learned the hard way that what you think the government is reading is not as essential as what you think the government isn't reading. \n \n US cryptographers intercepted diplomatic communications at a 1922 conference \n \n  During the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre and his cohort watched the population with a careful eye and ruthlessly cracked down on internal dissent. \n   In 1793, the revolutionary government established 12-member \"committees of surveillance\" throughout the country. They were authorised to identify, monitor and arrest any suspicious former nobles, foreigners, nationals who had recently returned from abroad, suspended public officials and many more. \n   Historians estimate that as many as half a million people were targeted by the surveillance committees, which were particularly ruthless in smaller French towns. \n   When neighbours have the power to spy, the results can be tragic. \n   In the 18th and 19th Centuries, governments undertook surveillance with bureaucratic gusto. Across Europe, they established departments called \"black chambers\" (from the French, cabinet noir) to read the letters of targeted individuals. \n   The bureaux, usually located in post office buildings, employed a variety of techniques to surreptitiously open, copy and reseal correspondence, then forward the missives on to the unsuspecting recipients. \n   The practice embroiled the British government in scandal in 1844 when it was revealed that the London black chamber was secretly reading the mail of exiled Italian author and activist Giusseppe Mazzini. \n   Many in the British public were outraged that their government had passed information to the Neapolitans, who used it to execute Mazzini's fellow revolutionaries. \n   In Europe, the industrial revolution was also a revolution in spycraft. \n Negotiating with espionage \n\t  In 1922, the United States hosted a naval disarmament conference in Washington, where it oversaw talks among nine nations, including United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan. \n \n The intelligence agency Stasi kept files on 10 million East Germans \n \n  It also spied on the Japanese and other negotiating teams, intercepting and decrypting communications between delegations and their home countries. \n   Thanks in part to inside knowledge about negotiation positions provided by the US Cipher Bureau, the government cryptography office founded A world history of government spying in 1919, the US was able to successfully broker several multinational treaties and agreements that headed off a naval arms race. \n   In 1929, the Cypher Bureau was shut down by Secretary of State Henry Stimson, who said: \"Gentlemen don't read each other's mail.\" \n   After World War Two, the Americans decided gentlemen need a permanent surveillance network. \n   Behind the Cold War's Iron Curtain, surveillance of the population was an everyday part of life. Nowhere was this more prevalent than in East Germany, where for nearly 40 years the Stasi intelligence service monitored and reported on the activities of its citizens, using the information to stifle unrest. \n   By the time the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Stasi had grown to more than 91,000 officers, with an active informer network of close to 200,000. \n   The East German surveillance state used modern technology and massive manpower to expand government spying on a previously unimaginable scale. \n   The United States entered the surveillance business in earnest following World War Two, when it began collecting and monitoring all telegraph information coming into and out of the country as part of Project Shamrock. It also created a \"watch list\" of US citizens suspected of \"subversive\" activities whose communications it kept tabs on as part of Project Minaret. \n   The operation was taken over by the newly formed National Security Agency (NSA), which co-operated with the FBI and CIA. Both programmes were shut down after an investigation by the US Congress in 1975. \n   Thirty-eight years later, the NSA has rebuilt Project Shamrock using the technology of the information age. \n   And the rest, as they say, is history...", "topics": [], "author": "Anthony Zurcher", "wordCount": 1046}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.nytimes.com", "title": "Egypt\u2019s Ex-President Is Defiant at Murder Trial", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/world/middleeast/egypt.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text": "A Mohamed Morsi supporter waves a flag that reads \"No to the coup\" outside the Supreme Constitutional Court in Cairo. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n  \nCAIRO \u2014 As Egypt\u2019s new military-led government consolidates its power, Mohamed Morsi, the deposed president, went on trial on Monday, facing charges of inciting the murder of protesters, but he rejected the court\u2019s authority and proclaimed himself to be the country\u2019s legitimate ruler.   \n \n                \n\n\n\n \n \nThe trial got off to a late start, and the case was soon adjourned until Jan. 8.   \nThe trial\u2019s brief opening was Mr. Morsi\u2019s first public appearance since his removal from office on July 3 and, in a dizzying turn for Egypt, the second criminal trial of a former head of state in less than three years. Former President Hosni Mubarak, ousted in February 2011 and now under house arrest in a military hospital, is facing a retrial at the same site, the auditorium of a police academy.   \nAccording to the website of Al Ahram, Egypt\u2019s flagship state newspaper, the trial got under way as Mr. Morsi and 14 other Islamist defendants appeared in a caged dock and court officials called out their names. But news reports said the hearing was first delayed and then suspended after Mr. Morsi refused to dress in prison clothing and chants by his co-defendants drowned out the proceedings.   \nJournalists who were allowed into the courtroom were not permitted to take telephones or other communications devices, limiting the flow of information. But witnesses in the courtroom said that Mr. Morsi declared, \u201cThis trial is illegitimate,\u201d and said he was still Egypt\u2019s lawful president.   \nMr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist allies in the Muslim Brotherhood had called for major protests against the trial, and the Interior Ministry said it had deployed thousands of riot police officers to secure the streets. Shortly before 11 a.m., as the trial began, the streets remained quiet, but the number of demonstrators began to grow from only a few dozen to perhaps 100 in two locations outside the court.   \nPro-Morsi demonstrators gathered in larger numbers at the Supreme Constitutional Court in the Maadi district of southern Cairo, witnesses said.   \nFor the new government installed by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the trial will be a ritual demonstration of its repeated assurances that there will be no turning back from the overthrow of Mr. Morsi or from the cancellation of the Islamist-drafted constitution approved in December in a national referendum. The court proceedings add formal legal legitimacy to Mr. Morsi\u2019s incarceration, analysts said, so that it is no longer by military fiat alone.   \nHe is charged with inciting the murders of at least three protesters in a night of street fighting between his supporters and opponents outside the presidential palace in December. But rights advocates say the charges are selective at best.   \nAs increasingly aggressive protesters began encircling the palace the night before the protesters were killed \u2014 even throwing Molotov cocktails over its walls \u2014 the police refused to protect it. So on Dec. 5, leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood publicly called for the president\u2019s Islamist supporters to do the job themselves, by force if necessary.   \nHundreds of Islamists arrived that afternoon and forcibly evicted a small encampment the protesters had set up near the palace, and by nightfall thousands of Islamists were gathered to defend the site. Thousands of Mr. Morsi\u2019s opponents attacked the Islamists, and a night of deadly street fighting ensued, with rocks, Molotov cocktails and gunshots coming from both sides.   \nBy morning, at least 11 people were dead, including at least eight supporters of the president and at least three non-Islamists, according to news reports. Prosecutors have not charged anyone over the Islamists\u2019 deaths, and the charges against Mr. Morsi are related to the killing of three non-Islamists.   \nMr. Morsi\u2019s supporters committed other abuses as the night went on, informally detaining and beating a number of his opponents they had captured in the fight. In the morning, the Islamists sought to turn their detainees over to prosecutors, to charge them with assaulting the presidential palace, but the prosecutors immediately released them. Mr. Morsi may also be charged in relation to those detentions by his civilian supporters.   \nMr. Morsi has been held incommunicado since his ouster, without access to his lawyer. A legal team preparing to represent him has said that he has spoken at least twice with his family over the telephone. But his supporters have said that they do not recognize the authority of the court, deeming the current military-backed government illegal and illegitimate.   \nMr. Mubarak\u2019s removal from office, in contrast, was given a degree of legal legitimacy when his vice president, Omar Suleiman, announced Mr. Mubarak\u2019s resignation. Initially placed under house arrest by the military at his beach house in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Mr. Mubarak was eventually charged with corruption as well as with directing security forces in the killing of hundreds of unarmed protesters during the 18-day uprising that ended his rule.   \nMr. Mubarak was allowed to consult with a legal team that included Egypt\u2019s most prominent defense lawyer. He was acquitted of the corruption charges on technical grounds, and he now faces a retrial on the charges related to the protesters\u2019 deaths. Mr. Mubarak was convicted of those charges in the final weeks of military rule before Mr. Morsi\u2019s election, but the judge all but openly stated that he was convicting Mr. Mubarak for political reasons.   \nAn appellate court ordered a retrial, and another judge ordered Mr. Mubarak released from prison. But the new government has kept him under house arrest in a military hospital for unspecified reasons related to public security.   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.", "topics": [], "author": "DAVID D.

It paraphrased an Egyptian cabinet minister saying that his government and its opponent, the Muslim Brotherhood, should pursue \u201creconciliation.\u201d   \n \n                \n\n\n \n \nBut the headline meant trouble for the minister, Ziad Bahaa el-Din, a lonely voice calling for restraint in Egypt\u2019s hard-line government. In the divisive months since the military deposed President Mohamed Morsi, \u201creconciliation\u201d has become something of a dirty word. During a television appearance, a host asked Mr. Bahaa el-Din about the headline, suggesting it would cause outrage.   \nHe explained that what he actually said was that the country needed to move toward \u201ccalm, and a new political framework.\u201d   \nThere is little appetite for compromise in Egypt these days, with the country on a war footing and security officials rallying the news media and large sections of the public to their fight against the Islamists. The climate has left Mr. Bahaa el-Din in a precarious place, trying to coax the government toward moderation while coming under fire from both the military\u2019s supporters and its critics.   \nPro-military columnists and commentators have derided him as a fifth columnist. On the other side, some antigovernment activists question why he continues to serve alongside officials who ordered the worst mass killings in recent Egyptian history.   \nAnd his supporters hope that Mr. Bahaa el-Din will hang on, to lend reason to the government\u2019s debates, and to monitor abuses by Egypt\u2019s emboldened security services.   \n\u201cThere needs to be someone to put on the brakes on what the government can do,\u201d said Khaled Fahmy, an Egyptian historian who has been a friend of Mr. Bahaa el-Din\u2019s since college.   \nAfter trying and failing to stave off the government\u2019s brutal crackdown on Islamist sit-ins in August, Mr. Bahaa el-Din is now staking his reputation on fighting a draft law that human rights advocates say would essentially criminalize protests.   \nHis approach to the battle, and others, he said, is to \u201cget away from the polarity of the government versus the Brotherhood \u2014 to ensure there is a democratic path, so we don\u2019t get fixated on that transaction.\u201d   \nBut there may be no getting away from it. Egypt\u2019s latest polarizing moment is expected Monday, when Mr. Morsi\u2019s trial on murder charges is scheduled to begin. Mr. Morsi\u2019s treatment has been widely criticized \u2014 he has been held virtually incommunicado for months \u2014 and his supporters say the trial is intended to produce victor\u2019s justice rather than truth.   \nMr. Bahaa el-Din said he saw little hope for an end to the standoff between the Brotherhood and the government, and blamed the Brotherhood for not responding to various political initiatives, despite the fact that most of its leadership is imprisoned or on the run.   \n\u201cSignals can be sent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who is willing to make a statement about this can begin to have a discussion. But there has been no reaction so far, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d   \nWith no resolution in sight, the military-backed government, bolstered by billions of dollars in aid from wealthy Persian Gulf nations, has pressed ahead with what it calls a road map that will lead to elections.   \nBefore he joined the interim government as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, Mr. Bahaa el-Din, 49, a lawyer and an economist, had a reputation as an independent, effective technocrat who stood out from Egypt\u2019s flailing bureaucracy. He served under the country\u2019s longtime autocrat, President Hosni Mubarak, including a tenure as head of the country\u2019s investment authority, and championed anti-corruption initiatives while remaining one of the few senior officials who did not join the ruling National Democratic Party. After Mr. Mubarak\u2019s fall, he helped start a political party and won a seat in Parliament representing the city of Assiut.   \nLike his father, who was a well-known columnist, Mr. Bahaa el-Din wrote frequently about Egyptian politics, \u00a0avoiding polemics while writing in opposition to the Islamists during their time in power, Mr. Fahmy said.   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting. \t \n\n \t\t\t\t\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n  \nAfter he joined the government, Mr. Bahaa el-Din\u2019s name started to surface in the news media again in August. He was said to be part of a tiny group led by the vice president, Mohamed ElBaradei, that was trying to persuade Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the defense minister, not to send security forces to storm two Islamist sit-ins in Cairo.   \n \n                \n\n\n \n \n\u201cThey were pushing for a political solution,\u201d said Karim Medhat Ennarah, a human rights advocate. \u201cThere were divisions, and Sisi was torn between the two camps. I don\u2019t think it was inevitable.\u201d   \nBut the hard-liners prevailed, leading to the killings of hundreds of protesters. Mr. ElBaradei immediately resigned in protest. Many people assumed that Mr. Bahaa el-Din would follow him.\u00a0   \nHis future in the government has remained a constant topic of speculation since then, and he said in the interview that he was tired of discussing it. \u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d he said. The debates about his role overshadowed what he said was progress on other fronts, including a large economic stimulus package and financial relief for farmers and students.   \n\u201cEvery time I talk about economics, no one seems to care,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend about 90 percent of my time on this.\u201d   \nBut he also seemed to understand that his success would be measured differently, and noted that the debate over the emerging Constitution, the new election law and other legislation represented important tests of the government\u2019s effectiveness.   \nOthers set a different standard. Mona Seif, an activist working to end military trials for civilians, said advocates had presented Mr. Bahaa el-Din and other ministers with the names of some of the thousands of people detained since July \u2014 many of them on political charges \u2014 and received no response.   \nBefore the military takeover, she noted, Mr. Bahaa el-Din had been an outspoken critic of military trials for civilians. \u201cNow there is nothing,\u201d she said.   \nWith the government committing mass human rights violations, she said, if \u201cyou are not using all your political weight to stop it, you\u2019re as much a part of it as anyone,\u201d adding, \u201cYou tend to expect much more from people who are considered to be on your side.\u201d   \nTo fight the proposed protest law, Mr. Bahaa el-Din appears to have tried both confrontation and consensus-building. The Egyptian news media has published accounts of a yelling match over a draft of the law between him and the interior minister, Mohamed Ibrahim, who had advocated the crackdown on the sit-ins. At the same time, Mr. Bahaa el-Din brought together human rights activists and political parties in the hope of building \u201ca wide constituency\u201d to water down the legislation, said Mr. Ennarah, the activist.   \nMr. Bahaa el-Din said he was not sure if the effort had succeeded but hoped it would provide a template for other fights. \u201cSo much depends on how much the democratic forces will keep pressing,\u201d he said.   \n\u201cThe outcome is not determined yet.\u201d   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting.", "topics": [], "author": "KAREEM FAHIM", "wordCount": 1168}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.nytimes.com", "title": "Pakistani Party Votes to Block NATO Supply Lines if Drones Persist", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/world/asia/pakistani-party-votes-to-block-nato-supply-lines-if-drone-strikes-persist.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text": "LONDON \u2014 The ruling party in a northwest province of Pakistan voted Monday to block NATO supply lines by Nov. 20 unless the United States stops its drone strikes in the nearby tribal belt.   \n \n                \n\n\n \n \nThe party, Tehrik-i-Insaf, which governs Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, passed a resolution that threatened to block the supply lines through the region in response to a C.I.A. missile strike that killed Hakimullah Mehsud , the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, on Friday.   \nThe death of Mr. Mehsud has triggered a furious reaction from Pakistani politicians, particularly Imran Khan, the leader of Tehrik-i-Insaf, who with others said that the targeted killing had derailed incipient peace talks with the Taliban.   \nBut Mr. Khan\u2019s resolution stopped short of imposing an immediate blockade on NATO supplies. Setting the Nov. 20 deadline was a means of building pressure on the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to end American drone strikes, while buying time to avoid a tricky confrontation with Mr. Sharif\u2019s administration, which does not favor blocking NATO lines.   \nIn his first public remarks since Friday\u2019s lethal drone strike, Mr. Sharif said Monday that peace could not be achieved in Pakistan \u201cby unleashing senseless force.\" He later told the cabinet that he would press ahead with efforts to strike a peace deal with the Taliban.   \nUnusually, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan backed Pakistan\u2019s protests, saying that the American strike \u201ctook place at an unsuitable time.\u201d He told an American congressional delegation in Kabul on Sunday that he hoped the peace process would not suffer as a result.   \nMr. Khan has led the tide of outrage in Pakistan since Friday, making heated accusations of American sabotage of the peace process, and threatening to cut the NATO lines unless the drone campaign ends.   \nThe United States, having weathered years of Pakistani criticism over the drone campaign, is unlikely to accede to his demand, although the pace of drone strikes has already dropped sharply this year.   \nMr. Khan\u2019s threat contains one irony: Peshawar residents say that much of the NATO traffic through the northwest is now headed out of Afghanistan, not into the country, in preparation for the withdrawal of Western combat troops by the end of 2014.   \nIf Mr. Khan were to cut those routes, he would be slowing the withdrawal of American troops \u2013 a withdrawal that he has demanded for years, citing the American presence in the region as a cardinal factor in fueling Islamist militancy inside Pakistan.   \nCritics point out that Mr. Khan has financial levers at his disposal to punish the United States, too. Foreign donors, including the United States, will provide about development assistance of about $325 million this year, or about 30 percent of the province\u2019s budget.   \nBut the provincial finance minister, Sirajul Haq, ruled out sending that money back. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight war with them,\u201d Mr. Haq said in an interview. \u201cThe government will continue to honor its commitments with international donors.\u201d   \nThe drones issue also contains potential financial stakes for Mr. Sharif\u2019s federal government. During a trip to Washington last month, when Mr. Sharif met President Obama, the State Department said it was releasing $1.6 billion in aid that had been frozen during a previous confrontation, and would provide another $1 billion this coming year.   \nThe Taliban leadership, meanwhile, is meeting at an undisclosed location in North Waziristan to choose a successor to Mr. Mehsud. A rival commander named Khan Said is the favorite, but no final decision has been made. The groups said Sunday that Asmatullah Shaheen Bhittani, the head of their governing council, would lead the Taliban until a replacement was chosen.   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \u00a0Declan Walsh reported from London, and Ismail Khan from Peshawar, Pakistan.", "topics": [], "author": "DECLAN WALSH and ISMAIL KHAN", "wordCount": 608}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www-nc.nytimes.com", "title": "Diplomats Try to Push Syria Peace Conference", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/world/middleeast/syria.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text": "GENEVA \u2014 Senior United States, Russian and United Nations diplomats met in Geneva on Tuesday at the start of a series of meetings aimed at building momentum for a second Syria peace conference despite bitter rifts within Syrian opposition groups and other states in the region.   \n \n                \n\n\n\n \n \nWendy R. Sherman, the United States undersecretary of state for political affairs, and two deputy Russian foreign ministers, Mikhail Bogdanov and Gennady Gatilov, began Tuesday\u2019s talks by meeting Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. and Arab League special envoy for Syria, who has just completed a tour of Arab capitals that vividly exposed the divisions in Syria and the region that diplomats will have to bridge to bring about the peace talks known as Geneva 2.   \nIn a meeting with President Bashar al-Assad last week, the Syrian leader repeated to Mr. Brahimi that \u201conly the Syrian people are authorized to shape the future of Syria,\u201d a formula that rebuffs Western demands that he should surrender power as part of a peace process.   \nIn Cairo, Arab foreign ministers formally endorsed the proposed meeting and urged Ahmad Jarba, the head of the opposition National Coalition, to participate. But Mr. Jarba, who is backed by Saudi Arabia, said the opposition would not join the Geneva talks if Iran, an ally of President Assad, attended and without a clear timetable for Mr. Assad to step down. The coalition also has little leverage over rebel groups that have warned that anyone participating in Geneva 2 would be considered traitors.   \nThe meeting in Geneva came a day after Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Riyadh to try to assuage mounting Saudi impatience at what it fears may be weakening pressure from Washington for forcing Mr. Assad from office.   \nIn the face of such e obstacles, the late November target date for Geneva 2 appears ambitious, but Mr. Brahimi, speaking to reporters after his talks with President Assad, still held out the hope that parties to the conflict could be brought together \u201cin the next few weeks, not next year.\u201d   \nAfter the trilateral talks on Tuesday morning, Mr. Brahimi and the American and Russian delegations are to be joined by three other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Britain, China and France. Later in the day, the talks are to widen again to include senior officials from Syria\u2019s neighbors, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey as well as representatives from the Arab League.   \nThe talks in Geneva opened against a backdrop of increasing humanitarian alarm in Syria.   \nAccording to the United Nations, the number of Syrians needing help has surged to 9.3 million from 6.8 million in June. The figure represents some 40 percent of the estimated 23 million people in a country that has been seized by conflict since a crackdown on peaceful protest against President -Assad began in March 2011.   \nSince then, more than 110,000 people have died and, while Mr. Assad has agreed to dismantle chemical weapons stockpiles, fighting with conventional munitions still claims a daily toll, forcing many to flee their homes and blocking efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance.   \nValerie Amos, the top humanitarian official at the United Nations, told the Security Council on Monday that the number who have abandoned their homes but remained in Syria stood at 6.5 million compared to 4.25 million in June. Her remarks in a closed briefing to the Security Council were relayed by a spokeswoman, Amanda Pitt.   \n\u201cThe humanitarian situation in Syria continues to deteriorate rapidly and inexorably,\u201d Ms. Amos said.   \nHer spokeswoman added: \u201cAmos continues to press the council for their help and influence over those parties who can ensure the protection of civilians and civilian facilities; the safe passage of medical personnel and supplies; the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance; and can facilitate progress in expanding critical, lifesaving relief operations.\u201d   \nOn Monday, Faisal al-Miqdad, a deputy foreign minister, said the Syrian government was doing its best to deliver humanitarian aid and was pressing for the delivery of help to \u201ctrapped civilians, especially in hot spots,\u201d the official SANA news agency said.   \nBut Mr. Miqdad accused rebels seeking Mr. Assad\u2019s overthrow and of attacking aid convoys, hindering humanitarian deliveries. In recent days, concern has become particularly acute with fears of a polio epidemic.   \nIn late October, United Nations officials said they were mobilizing to vaccinate 2.5 million young children in Syria and more than eight million others in the region to combat what they fear could be an explosive outbreak of polio.   \nThe officials said that the discovery of a cluster of paralyzed young children in Deir al-Zour, a heavily contested city in eastern Syria, had prompted their alarm and that tests conducted by both the government and rebel sides strongly suggested that the children had been afflicted with polio.   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva, and Alan Cowell from London.", "topics": [], "author": "NICK CUMMING-BRUCE", "wordCount": 801}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www-nc.nytimes.com", "title": "Americans Jailed for Months in Qatar After Daughter\u2019s Death", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/world/middleeast/americans-accused-in-daughters-death-are-jailed-for-months-in-qatar.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text": "Grace and Matthew Huang with their daughter, Gloria, who died in January at age 8, and one of their sons, Emmanuel. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n  \nMatthew and Grace Huang, an American couple with three adopted children from Africa, lived as a family in the affluent Gulf kingdom of Qatar starting in July 2012. For most of the time since then, the parents have been imprisoned there, accused of starving their 8-year-old daughter to death with the intent of selling her organs.   \n \n\n \n \nThe Qatari authorities have repeatedly denied the Huangs\u2019 application for bail and only in the last few weeks have they permitted Mrs. Huang\u2019s mother to take the surviving children, two boys, home to the United States. Throughout the four pretrial hearings, lawyers for the defendants, who have asserted their innocence, have not been permitted to present their side of the story to the presiding judge. On Wednesday, they are scheduled to get that opportunity.   \nThere is no dispute that their daughter, Gloria, died on Jan. 15 after she had not eaten, perhaps for days. But the Huangs and their supporters have asserted that she had an underlying eating disorder that the prosecution has ignored. They have described the case as an egregious combination of flawed or nonexistent evidence, ethnic prejudice and extreme cultural misunderstandings in a host country where multiracial families are an anomaly and adoption is an alien concept.   \nThe Qatar police investigators, in their report of Gloria\u2019s death, found the family\u2019s circumstances highly suspicious, and wrote that the girl had been emaciated. The defendants, they concluded in an investigation, \u201cparticipated with others in child trafficking, most likely to either sell their organs or to conduct medical experiments on them.\u201d   \nThe Christianity practiced by the Huangs may also have raised the suspicions of the police, who noted in their reports that all three children had been home-schooled by their mother.   \nQuestioned in a February pretrial hearing about the proof of child trafficking, one investigator responded that \u201cthe adoption process consists of searching for children who are good-looking and well-behaved, and who have hereditary features that are similar to those of the parents,\u201d according to a translation of the court\u2019s Arabic transcript. \u201cBut the children connected to this incident are all from Africa and most of the families there are indigent.\u201d   \nThe case has raised questions about the justice system in Qatar, a close American ally, an aspiring center of a modern-day tolerant Islamic society and the first Arab country chosen to host the World Cup, in 2022. Adding to the pressure on Qatar, the case has been taken up by the California Innocence Project , a San Diego-based group that seeks to publicize what it regards as wrongful imprisonments, and the David House Agency , a Los Angeles-based group that specializes in helping clients entangled in complicated legal crises abroad.   \nConsular officials from the United States Embassy have also repeatedly inquired about the status of the case, a State Department official said, in what appeared to be a subtle source of additional pressure.   \n\u201cThe prosecution has been presenting its evidence without any input from our side,\u201d Alex Simpson, a trial lawyer assisting in the defense of the Huangs, who are from Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these people who have been sitting in jail for almost a year, and based on stuff they\u2019re not entirely sure about \u2014 where did it come from? We\u2019re going to be explaining to the court our side of the story for the first time.\u201d   \nHe called the incarceration a nightmare for the Huangs, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of like Kafka.\u201d   \nTelephone and email efforts to reach the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Doha, the capital, were not successful. There has been no indication that the prosecution or the presiding judge, Abdullah al-Emady, are preparing to drop the case or even consent to bail for a crime that carries the death penalty in Qatar.   \nIt was the World Cup that had brought the Huangs and their children to Qatar in 2012. Mr. Huang, an engineer, was recruited for a major infrastructure project to prepare for the soccer tournament.   \nThe defense contends that Mr. Huang, 37, and Mrs. Huang, 36, had been trying to manage a severe eating disorder with Gloria, who had spent a hungry childhood in Ghana. They said she would on occasion go for days without food, sometimes binging on junk food, or rummaging garbage, or stealing food that she would hide in her room. Such disorders are not uncommon among adopted children from deprived countries, American adoption experts say.   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Shabina Khatri contributed reporting from Doha, Qatar. \t \n\n \t\t\t\t\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n  \nDefense witnesses say Gloria was happy and active the day before she was found unconscious by the parents in her room on Jan. 15. She was pronounced dead after they rushed her to a hospital. But the cause of death is a central matter of dispute.   \n \n\n \n \nThe Qatar medical examiner, Dr. Anis Mahmoud Khalifa, concluded that she had died of starvation and dehydration, but provided no photographs or laboratory tests to substantiate the finding.   \nA pediatric forensic pathologist retained by the defense, Dr. Janice Ophoven, who specializes in child starvation cases, ruled out that possibility and noted that the parents had never been questioned about Gloria\u2019s eating habits.   \n\u201cOne cannot medically diagnose that a child was intentionally starved to death if the child was seen functioning and walking just a day before dying,\u201d Dr. Ophoven wrote in a statement to the court that the defense planned to submit on Wednesday. \u201cThis fact alone would appear to eliminate terminal effects of starvation as a cause of death.\u201d   \nEric Volz, the managing director of the David House Agency, said in a telephone interview that he was \u201cperplexed about why Qatar would let the case get this far,\u201d and said the United States ambassador to Qatar, Susan L. Ziadeh, had been \u201cattentive and helpful.\u201d Ms. Ziadeh did not respond to requests for comment on the case.   \nMr. Volz also faulted Mr. Huang\u2019s employer, MWH Global, an engineering and construction firm based in Broomfield, Colo., asserting that it should have taken a more aggressive role in helping with the Huangs\u2019 defense. Mr. Huang, he said, \u201cclearly wasn\u2019t prepared for something like this happening.\u201d   \nA spokeswoman for MWH, Faithe Gorman-Smith, responded in an email that the company had paid for the Huangs\u2019 legal counsel when they were arrested, was continuing to pay Mr. Huang\u2019s salary and benefits and providing other support for the family, and that the company remained \u201chopeful for a prompt resolution to this matter.\u201d   \n   \n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Shabina Khatri contributed reporting from Doha, Qatar.", "topics": [], "author": "RICK GLADSTONE", "wordCount": 1090}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www-nc.nytimes.com", "title": "Kenya Charges Four Men With Aiding Shopping Mall Attackers", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2013/11/04/us/04reuters-kenya-security-charges.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text": "NAIROBI \u2014 A Kenyan court charged four Somali men on Monday with terrorist offences for helping al Qaeda-linked militants carry out an attack on a shopping mall in Nairobi that killed 67 people.   \n \n \n \nFew details have emerged so far about the how the September attack was masterminded or how gunmen held off Kenyan security forces for four days in the Westgate mall.

Every two years, the women filled out detailed surveys describing their diets.  Over the next 15 years, researchers kept tabs on who among the women developed a whole host of chronic diseases including Parkinson's, cancer, lung and pulmonary disease. The women were also given a battery of memory tests, and researchers also evaluated physical function, meaning the women's abilities to move around and stay active.  \"This really suggests that a healthy diet can help improve multiple aspects of your health and your ability to function when you're older,\" says researcher Fran Grodstein of Harvard School of Public Health.  Meir Stampfer , co-author of the new paper, says he was \"surprised by the magnitude of the effects\" in the study, given what we already know about the heart benefits of a Mediterranean style diet.  Stampfer says this study adds to a growing body of evidence that all point to measurable benefits of eating a diet that is rich in plant-based food, low in saturated fats, meat and refined starch. He says he's changed his own eating habits based on the weight of the evidence.  \"I'm eating more nuts, berries and fruit,\" he says. As well as fewer potatoes, and less meat. \"And I'm happier.\"  Yes, the evidence suggests that our diets really can help shape mood and overall well-being.  Making The Shift  Adopting a Mediterranean-style diet is not as difficult as you you might think. It's not a complete diet overhaul.  \"Mediterranean cooking is simply a tweaking of basic cooking,\" says Chef Michael Friedman , part-owner of the Red Hen, a hip, newish restaurant in Washington, D.C.  Switching from butter to olive oil is the first step that any cook can make, Friedman says. After that, he says think about scaling up vegetables, even ones you normally overlook.  The day I visited Friedman whipped up a super creamy mushroom risotto topped with a parsnip puree. It sounds fancy, but Friedman says it's really pretty simple. You just roast the parsnips with thyme, garlic and a little salt, then put them in a blender.  \"If you look at it, it has the texture of creaminess, of butter,\" he says. \"But it's just a puree.\"  The taste is surprising.  Friedman agreed. There was no butter, no cream, no cheese, but the taste was divine. \"I kind of tricked myself a little bit,\" he says.  Oh, and a bit of good news for those who like a nice glass of vino to accompany the meal.

She and about 40 of her colleagues are staffing the phones for Maximus , the company Connecticut has contracted to run its call center.  The government contractors running the troubled HealthCare.gov website have been under intense scrutiny in the past month, but those businesses aren't the only ones being paid to rollout Obamacare.  In the states that are running their own health care exchanges, practices vary. Oregon, for instance, set up its own call centers; other states, like Connecticut, farm that business out to companies like Maximus.  \"It's a huge opportunity, and it remains so,\" says Rick Howard , an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. \"There are millions of millions of folks coming in for insurance coverage. That represents a great opportunity for both commercial carriers and for those contractors who are servicing health care.\"  How much is Maximus making in Connecticut? In a press release , the company valued the contract at $15 million over three years, for staffing and operating the call center. But that lump sum is all the information the company provides.  Access Health CT, the state's exchange , wouldn't confirm the $15 million price tag. And while it will say that it is paying a per minute fee per call, it won't say how that fee is calculated. In fact, its contract with Maximus that it makes available to the public blacks out all language that has to do with pricing.  That means that taxpayers can't know how much the state of Connecticut is paying Maximus.  Why?  Well, redactions are things that typically relate to privacy and competitive issues from vendors,\" says Kevin Counihan , CEO of Access Health CT, the state's new insurance marketplace. Counihan says state law allows vendors like Maximus to redact what they think is proprietary information from public documents.  But should pricing be propriety in a government contract?  \"Is price something that someone should be able to redact? I sure think so. What's the whole point? If everybody knows what everybody is pricing, everybody's going to be pricing at the same level. And that doesn't drive a good deal,\" Counihan says .  Maximus refused to comment on its Connecticut pricing. In a statement, the company says call centers are in a \"highly competitive industry.\"  But in emails to the state, the company justifies its position by saying that releasing its pricing information would \"result in irreparable economic damage to Maximus and significantly weaken its competitive position in the marketplace.\"  Maximus also has a contract in Hawaii. But in that state it doesn't have to disclose its contracts at all because its entire health insurance marketplace, the Hawaii Health Connector, is exempt from the state's sunshine laws.  Vermont's exchange handled things differently. It has posted on the internet a complete, unredacted copy of its contract with Maximus. The document spells out everything from how long a call can be on hold to how quickly it must be answered.  Mark Larson, the head of Vermont's exchange, explains: \"We are spending taxpayer dollars and we understand our responsibility to ensure that there's transparency in how those dollars are being spent, to whom they're being given, and what we get in return for them. And we want to make sure that it's easy for Vermonters or others to find that information.\"  According to the contract, Vermont pays Maximus 86 cents a minute for calls, and the state estimates a call volume of about 573,300 minutes per month. That comes out to about $500,000 a month.  Rick Howard, the Gartner analyst, says that, in an ideal world, none of the call center prices would matter. Everyone would sign up on the Internet.  \"This is just a really complicated, initially, enrollment cycle,\" Howard says. \"Once the websites continue to evolve, then I would expect, over time, call center activities to be greatly reduced from what they were here in the first months or year of the marketplace.\"  Until that happens, there's money to be made. But in Connecticut, the public just can't know how much.

That's the warning from some of the biggest investment funds, including BlackRock. \n   Certainly, the rise in equities in the US and Europe is in stark contrast to the anaemic economic recovery and has been a source of concern for a while. \n   To give a sense as to how much markets have risen by, if you had put your money in US stocks five years ago, you would have nearly doubled your investment. The S&P 500 index has risen by 91% since the end of 2008. \n   Asia may be seen as having strong long-term growth prospects, but Asian equities on average would have yielded about an 87% return, just slightly less than the US since the financial crisis. \n   Well, it's less of a worry for the EU where stocks have risen by about 28%, which is in spite of the euro crisis. Unless you invested in Germany of course, as the benchmark stock index the DAX has recently hit record highs. \n The Shiller question \n\t  Or, in Britain, where the FTSE 100 has risen by about 50% since the crash. In fact, it also recently reached all-time highs, as has the S&P and the Dow in the US. \n   Cheap money from central banks around the world, especially the Fed, has played a part in boosting markets which I have written about before . Of course, stocks also rise due to the fundamentals of companies. \n   No wonder there are so-called \"bulls\" who expect the rally to continue, while others worry that US stocks in particular are expensive when they look at Nobel Laureate Bob Shiller's measure of value. \n   There's a large divergence between the price of stocks and earnings in recent years in a series of data that dates back over a century. \n   According to Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that compares the S&P 500 with the average profits of the listed companies during the prior decade, stocks are expensive now relative to their earnings. \n   The ratio has risen to 24.4, the highest since 2007 and just below a peak reached in 27.5 in May of that year during the boom. \n   It's still some way below the days of the dotcom bubble at 44.2 in December 1999, but prices are diverging enough from earnings that it's a source of concern. \n \n \n  This isn't the only measure of value, so opinions will differ. Besides, some companies are doing well. \n   The S&P is experiencing an unprecedented fourth year of earnings growth, and its stocks are viewed as a leading indicator of where the economy is headed. \n Car firms return \n\t  One sector in particular - cars - has outperformed the S&P this year. Auto retailers are up 28%, auto manufacturers are up 30%, and parts manufacturers have risen by 48% since the start of the year. \n   In fact, the consumer discretionary sector that includes companies like cars and consumer electronics are the best performer in the S&P, rising over 33% this year. \n   Durable goods like cars are considered to be good indicators of cyclical turning points in the economy. If people have disposable income to spend, then they are more likely to buy a car or they'll postpone it if they don't. \n   The car industry has picked up in the US and Europe. After rescues and restructuring, the Detroit automakers are recovering. \n   Chrysler, now owned by Italy's Fiat, reported a 22% rise in third quarter profit and a rise in net revenue by 13.5%. Somewhat less well, revenues at GM still rose by 3.7% to $39bn. \n   Europe's largest carmaker, Volkswagen, also reported an increase in profit to 2.78bn euros from 2.32bn euros in the third quarter of last year. \n   Of course, it's not a wholly rosy picture. Volvo Trucks is cutting jobs and Nissan has trimmed its full-year profit forecast due to weak activity in Europe. But, even in Europe, growing car rentals have helped Hertz report a 22% rise in third quarter sales. \n   Interestingly, UK car production has defied the European trend for the past year or so. \n   Even while EU car sales have just fallen to the lowest level since records began in 1990, new car sales in Britain have risen for the 18th consecutive month and have returned to pre-recession levels. \n   It's not just in purchases, but also production and exports by the UK car industry. \n   Output for the year is up 9.9% from a year ago, and production has hit 1.5 million in the year to September which is the highest since the financial crisis. \n   Exports have also risen by 9.3% from a year ago as more luxury vehicles are sold to China, Russia, and the US. \n   For Britons, the Ford Focus was the most popular new car bought in the past year. It's not a flashy car, but then this isn't a flashy recovery. \n   For those who like to check out cars, there's perhaps now a couple of reasons to do so. \n   It may not tell you if there is a bubble, but the auto industry does reveal a crucial bit of information about people's disposable incomes.", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 909}, {"date": "2013-10-31 20:03:00", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "Si Shen: Rebuilding Papaya Mobile", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24749575#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "Papaya Mobile's Si Shen talks about rebuilding her business after falling off Apple's platform \n\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n \n\n\n      Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families? One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of Papaya Mobile, which produces games for mobile phones. \n   Si Shen was born and grew up in China. Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot. \n   Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise. \n   When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist. \n   But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas. Her mother's example influenced her heavily. \n   Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. \n   \"He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.' And because of this dream, he changed the world.\" \n   She remembers thinking: \"That's so cool! I want to do something like that!\" \n   Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California. \n   By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company. At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur. \n   He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first. \n Gaining experience \n\t  Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal. \n   At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time. She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying \"I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company.\" \n   She got the job. \n   After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008. \n \n Si Shen's mobile phone games have attracted millions of players \n \n  They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market. After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise. \n   At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular. \n   Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone. \n   The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point. \n   \"All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users.\" \n 'I couldn't sleep' \n\t  Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store. \n   As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on. \n   The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion. \n   \"Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.' That was a very serious situation,\" she remembers. \n   \"I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees. Everybody was looking at me every day. They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer.\" \n   She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area. \n   Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games. \n   \"Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone,\" she recalls. \n   She was devastated.

Many, especially the young, can find work only \"on the black\" - employed in the shadow economy, without a contract or the rights that go with it. \n   But after years stuck in this trap, Stella Sermoneta has had enough. She has decided to learn how to make pizza, a skill recognised and valued around the world. With this new skill, she hopes to find a new life overseas, perhaps in Israel or the US, where she has relatives. \n   She has a job in Rome, working in a call centre, but she has no contract. She's employed illegally - \"on the black\". \n   \"If you work without a contract, you can't have lots of normal things like a new house because the bank doesn't give mortgages without a contract,\" she says. \n   \"You can't spend money on normal things because you don't know where you are going to be tomorrow.\" \n   A black job won't give her a reference for her next step up the career ladder, and she doesn't feel she can start a family without more security. \n   She says more than half her friends are in a similar position, and the only way out for her is to emigrate. \n Unpaid taxes \n\t  The dire position of Italy's young in the job market was highlighted in August, when the rate of unemployment among 18 to 24-year-olds hit a record high of 40.1%. It's not clear how many young people are working informally, but Italy's black economy is known to be large. \n   According to a study by Prof Friedrich Schneider of Johannes Kepler University of Linz in Austria, the shadow economy in Italy makes up a fifth of the country's entire GDP, higher than the EU average, and higher than Spain or Portugal. \n   Italy's financial police, the Guardia di Finanza, are doing what they can to crack down on it. \n   Last year they identified 30,000 illegal workers, of whom about 16,500 were employed completely on the black, with no contract whatsoever. \n   \"Fighting undeclared work is important as it harms and undermines many interests,\" says Lt Col Cosimo Virgilio of the Guardia di Finanza. \n   \"It hurts the state and the national budget, because it means taxes aren't paid. And our purpose is also to protect honest businesses. Those that comply with the law suffer unfair competition from other companies which are able to sell their goods and services at lower prices.\" \n   The problem is more concentrated in Italy's poorer south, with sectors dominated by seasonal or casual work such as restaurants, hotels and other service industries like call centres or care homes. \n   Stefano Ferraina, who runs a job centre in the south of Rome, confirms that working on the black has long been a feature of Italian working life. \n   \"It was once a short-term, temporary bridge,\" he says, \"to fill the gap between education and a permanent job that would give the opportunity to start a family and create a future. \n   \"Now, unfortunately, this has increasingly become the only opportunity available.\" \n Death threats \n\t  High employment taxes are one reason why it's tempting for employers to hire on the black. For every euro an employer spends on hiring a worker, 48 cents goes on taxes and social security payments, and only 52 cents into the employee's pocket. Cut out the taxes and payments, and workers look a lot cheaper. \n   On top of this, a raft of regulations makes it unattractive for Italian employers to give young workers proper contracts. \n   \"Older workers are much more protected,\" says Pietro Reichlin, a professor of economics at Rome's LUISS University. \n   \"It is much more difficult for firms to get rid of staff if they are unproductive, or to make their contracts more flexible. So it is much easier for young guys to get employed with contracts that are not officially registered.\" \n   To solve this problem, he says, Italy could look to reduce this burden of tax and regulation. But changing the rules around employment is a slow and difficult process in Italy. \n   In 1999 and 2002, professors working as advisers to the government were murdered by left-wing paramilitaries opposed to labour market reform. Death threats have been made to advisers of the current government. \n   Stella understands why employers hire people on the black. \"You're not angry because you know what is behind the black market. They can't afford all the payments. They have to live too.\" \n   But it's yet another barrier between Italy's youth and a career that allows them to fulfil their dreams.", "topics": [], "author": "Ben King", "wordCount": 767}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "Breaking Bad</em> Creator Vince Gilligan to Make Acting Debut on Community</em>", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/334bd0f8/sc/17/l/0L0Swired0N0Cunderwire0C20A130C110Cvince0Egilligan0Ecommunity0C/story01.htm", "text": "When you obsessively mastermind a show like Breaking Bad through five molar-grinding seasons, you deserve a mini-vacation or two: It\u2019s just been announced that Vince Gilligan will shift gears rather dramatically early next year when he makes his onscreen debut as a guest star on NBC\u2019s\u00a0 Community . \n According to Entertainment Weekly , he\u2019ll play \u201ca smooth-talking gold digger who winds up exacerbating a fight between Annie (Alison Brie) and Abed (Danny Pudi),\u201d in an episode that\u2019s being filmed this very week, and will air sometime \u201cin late winter or early spring,\u201d a few months after the penultimate season premieres January 2.

Image: AMC/Gene Page \n Rick Grimes is the very worst. \n If we\u2019ve had anything to be happy about this season on The Walking Dead , anything at all, it\u2019s the fact that Rick has spent most of his time hoeing crops down at the prison farm in\u00a0his invisible overalls, a place where at least his terrible decisions can only hurt potatoes instead of people. Unfortunately, since Rick remains the main character of the show, this blessed respite cannot last forever; no matter how much he \u2013 and we \u2013 would prefer it, we cannot abandon him to the cabbages that he surely loves like children and spend that time with far more interesting characters like Carl, Daryl, Michonne, Carol, Maggie and Glenn. Instead we must refocus, yet again, on Rick, a character so boring that it is increasingly difficult to work up the energy necessary to roll my eyes at him. \n Yes, this is episode where Rick becomes The Leader once more, supposedly because he is so\u00a0 good at it . The show really needs us to believe this, which is why they\u2019ve recruit to Daryl and Carol \u2013 probably the two most solid members of the group, and far better candidates for leadership \u2013 to get up during the last two episodes and give speeches about how great Rick was.\u201cYou were a good leader, probably better than I gave you credit for\u201d lies Carol, convincing no one. \n Just in case you\u2019ve forgotten how useless and terrible Rick has been over the last four years, let\u2019s examine his highlight reel. You may remember Rick\u2019s complete absence of leadership in the first season, as he lead his crew on a haphazard and occasionally lethal journey to Somewhere, I Guess. Or his bumbling leadership at the farm, where he repeatedly failed to make decisions until they escalated into dangerous situations; not only did he refuse to kill Shane until long after he became an significant threat to the group, but he saved Randall, a member of a brutal rival gang, rather than leaving him to die \u2014 then decided to kill him, then changed his mind and decided not to kill him, at least until someone else finally killed him. Decisiveness! \n This dithering isn\u2019t just a phenomenon of the earlier season; he makes the exact same mistake at the end of Season 3, agreeing to a deal with the Governor that trades Michonne for the safety of everyone else in the prison, before changing his mind and deciding not to do it \u2013 but not before someone else follows through. Other major inconsistencies include the time he gathered the group together to announce \u00a0that he was the absolute leader and that \u201cthis isn\u2019t a democracy anymore,\u201d which he reneged on recently, announcing that \u201cit\u2019s not my call [to] sacrifice one of us for the greater good\u201d before stepping down as leader. \n I\u2019d like to say that is Rick\u2019s whole problem, but he has a lot of them. That is surely one of the big ones, however: His unwillingness to do what should be done or what needs to be done, because he\u2019s too busy flip-flopping on key decisions thanks to the wandering arrow of his persistent but shaky moral compass. Carol, notably, does not have this problem \u2014 most controversially, she killed the first two seriously ill flu victims in hopes of preventing the spread of the lethal disease in the closed quarters of the prison \u2014 and Rick responds by reclaiming the leadership he said he didn\u2019t want just long enough to kick her out of the group.\u00a0Even though he is technically still a farmer, Rick is still an autocrat on the inside, and has no problem deeming this crime is worthy of banishment and himself worthy of imposing sentence. \n Great job, Rick, really. I admire the fact that you don\u2019t even have to work your way up to your previously spectacular level of bad decision-making; you\u2019re able to hit the ground running and pick up right where you left off. It\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019ve decided to exile perhaps the most useful person in the group \u2013 one who compensates for many of your personal weaknesses and is frankly a better candidate for running the prison than you \u2013 because she made what amounted to a difficult leadership decision in a life or death situation. \n After all, we\u2019ve seen Rick make a number of these calls in situations that were slightly ambiguous, including murdering both Shane and Tomas; the difference, arguably, is that they presented more direct threats, which according to whatever shifting moral code he\u2019s using today, makes them good kills. But let\u2019s be clear: Carol\u2019s crime wasn\u2019t just killing people, it was Killing People While Not Being Rick, in ways that his invisible and capricious Big Book of Post-Apocalyptic Morality don\u2019t deem acceptable. Despite telling everyone at the end of last season that he doesn\u2019t get to make unilateral calls about whether people in the group live or die \u2013 which is unbelievably na\u00efve, given that those are basically the only calls people ever make on this show \u2013 Rick unilaterally decides that Carol is out and sends her off to deal with the zombies alone, because total inconsistency is just one of the many benefits his leadership offers. \n This is a man, remember, in the very recent past went into a fugue state and then spent a significant span of time believing that he was having telephone conversations with his deceased wife. Forget the zombies: by far the most unbelievable part of the show is the idea that anyone would want the mentally imbalanced, dithering Rick to make life-and-death decisions for them given his long history of making bad ones \u2013 or worse, refusing to make decisions at all. \n \u201cIf you thought it would save Judith or Carl would you have done it then, or would you have gone back to your crops and hoped everything would be ok?\u201d asks Carol, when Rick finally calls her out for killing the flu victims. If history is any indication, then yes: Rick absolutely would have waited until the very last moment to make that sort of tough decision, something that could prove fatal when it comes to the outbreak of a virulent and deadly disease. \n Shortly before they part ways, Rick and Carol meet a young couple who want to come back and join the prison. Rick says they should wait in safety while he and Carol scavenge for medicine, but Carol wants them to pull their their weight and help out. The latter proves fatal to the less experienced survivors, and when they don\u2019t return, Carol is the one who finally makes the call that it\u2019s time to leave while Rick wants to keep sitting there, waiting, while the people who need the medicine at the prison grow sicker and sicker. It\u2019s her final gift of pragmatism to Rick, who continues to revert back to his pre-zombie moral compass whenever it suits him and make decisions based some vague notion of how he wishes things could be, rather than the way they are. \n \u201cIt\u2019s about facing reality. It always comes for us and over and over against, we face it so we can live,\u201d says Carol. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it, Rick. Just accept it.\u201d But Rick never met a harsh reality that he didn\u2019t want to both evade and judge morally, so he tells Carol to hit the road instead. \n Farewell, Carol. I hope Daryl comes to find you and you two live happily ever after somewhere in a group that is not inexplicably beholden to the whims of a severely traumatized, self-righteous cowboy. \n There are other things that happen, but they don\u2019t matter, really. The other group searching for meds runs into zombies but nobody dies, although everyone is sad and angry for a variety of reasons that they can\u2019t let go of: Tyreese because his girlfriend got killed; Michonne because of the governor; Bob because he\u2019s an alcoholic; Daryl because Bob is an alcoholic. They all drive around in cars thinking about how sad and angry they are until the credits roll while Sharon Van Etten sings a song about everything changing, even though exactly one thing of importance happened in the last hour.

Image: Hector Llanqu\u00edn The first-person dash through the maze of thick, red brick walls. The tangle of pipes in space, forever growing and folding. Those flying toasters . The screensavers of the 1990s are strangely memorable, although I guess it makes sense when you consider that the 1990s were the peak of the CRT era, a time when screens actually needed saving. Today\u2019s LCDs, impervious to burn-in, don\u2019t really need the things, and when you do actually see them, they\u2019re often just the anodyne defaults\u2013anodyne abstract art, maybe, or rainforest scenes. Idle Screenings , a free app for Mac and Windows, brings back some of that good old After Dark weirdness. Every month, it will beam a strange new video artwork to your unused screen.\n \u201cWe were interested in using a screensaver for this purpose because it seemed that this was a kind of maligned and shelved technology,\u201d says Mitch Trale, the app\u2019s co-creator. \u201cWe thought it would be good to animate this disused space, and to present an alternative to the shareware relics available today.\u201d After all, if we have to live in a world full with screens, why not live in a world full of screens showing art? \n\n A screen saver is an energy waster. For Trale, that only heightens the stakes of the project. \n Because of electricity, that\u2019s why. A screen saver is, in effect, an energy waster. But for Trale, that only heightens the stakes of the project. How valuable is a daily dose of art, in light of our world\u2019s precarious energy situation? And how does pure aesthetic delight stack up against all the other things we let our devices do all day and all night? The app, Trale says, \u201ccalls attention to computers as these always-on, greedy appliances.\u00a0Consumer technology leeches electricity from the walls for our constant convenience. \u00a0DVRs are busy at home while we are at work. \u00a0And what about bandwidth? \u00a0My torrents run upstream all night long.\u00a0Is this wasteful? What else should I be doing with that pipe?\u201d \n Resource consumption aside, the app is a clever little way to disseminate art. \u201cThere is this cacophony of visual work available online, and our experience with that work is often very elective,\u201d Trale explains. When you\u2019re on Tumblr or Facebook, you\u2019re seeing things you\u2019re predisposed to liking, either because you\u2019ve liked them in the past or because your friends think you\u2019ll like them. When you\u2019re searching Google to find more of an artists work, you\u2019re essentially getting art on demand. Idle Screenings is just the opposite\u2013you don\u2019t get to see the goods until you\u2019re away from your computer, or doing something else. \u201cI think this runs counter to the classic value structures of our attention economy, which is interesting to us,\u201d Trale explains. \n Ultimately, Idle Screenings made my MacBook run a little too hot and a little too loud for me to stick with it. For the few weeks I did use it, though, I loved it\u2013coming back to my computer to see Kim Laughton\u2019s insane revolving orrery of foliage, disembodied heads and Coke cans was always a treat. And though it might\u2019ve used some extra juice, it\u2019s hard to put a price on reminding people that, even in 2013, long after the last copy of After Dark had been installed, we can still use our screens for introducing some weird flying stuff into the world.", "topics": [], "author": "Kyle VanHemert", "wordCount": 567}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "CEO Out as BlackBerry Fumbles Fire Sale", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/334b3038/sc/5/l/0L0Swired0N0Cbusiness0C20A130C110Cblackberry0Eceo0Eresigns0C/story01.htm", "text": "Thorsten Heins, shown here during happier times, is out as CEO of BlackBerry.

Software developers won\u2019t bring their killer games to your platform if there isn\u2019t a critical mass of addressable customers \u2014 but those customers won\u2019t buy your hardware in the first place without exclusive software. \n The difficulty of squaring this circle is the reason why the history of the gaming business is strewn with the bodies of failed platforms. If you release a new piece of gaming hardware without at least attempting to resolve that fundamental chicken-and-egg problem, you\u2019re dead before you even launch. Yes, there are ways to do it, but they\u2019re not foolproof, even if you\u2019re an industry giant \u2014 witness Nintendo, with sales of its new Wii U platform deep underwater and minimal developer support for its second Christmas season. \n Nintendo\u2019s fall from grace might give Sony and Microsoft, the current kings of the living room, more confidence when it comes to the launches of their respective new platforms, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, later this month. But soon enough, they\u2019ll have another competitor, one with a particular advantage: It might not have to tackle the chicken-egg problem at all. \n Last week, Valve announced that 65 million people were now active users of Steam , its gaming umbrella service for personal computers. That\u2019s a number on par with the installed bases of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It\u2019s a whole lot of gamers buying and playing the over 3,000 games on the service, from blockbusters like BioShock Infinite to one-man indie projects like Retro City Rampage and everything in between. \n Our customers love all those Steam titles, but they also like their families. \n If these players had Steam in their living rooms, it would be a close substitute for a traditional game console \u2014 if not better. And that\u2019s exactly what Valve\u2019s attempting. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Valve and a variety of hardware partners will unveil a range of Steam Machines , television game consoles of various power levels and price points, built with commodity PC parts, that run Valve\u2019s new Linux-based SteamOS operating system . Valve itself is nearing completion of a controller that is designed to eliminate the need for a keyboard-and-mouse setup. \n \u201cThere\u2019s a strong desire from our customers that we\u2019ve heard for a long time,\u201d says Valve product designer Greg Coomer. \u201cThey love all those [Steam] titles, but they also like their families. And whenever they had to go into the living room, they\u2019ve had to abandon everything they loved about the games in the other room of the house.\u201d \n Valve doesn\u2019t need to convince anybody to give up their Xbox. All it needs to do to disrupt the game console biz is get its current customers to bring Steam out of the computer room and onto the couch. \n  Playing with the new Steam Controller prototype. Photo: Matthew Ryan Williams/WIRED \n Taking me on a brief tour of Valve\u2019s headquarters \u2014 a few floors of a nondescript office building in Bellevue, a suburb of Seattle that is also home to Destiny developer Bungie and a short drive away from the offices of Microsoft and Nintendo \u2014 Coomer is trying to impress something upon me: Valve is a hardware company now. The halls are full of 3-D printers and electrical engineers sit at desks piled high with oscilloscopes, wires, and prototype hardware. It\u2019s all done here in the same office, he says, except for some stuff \u2014 injection molding, for example \u2014 that they legally can\u2019t do in their current office space, and have an offsite area for. \n \u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking of PC as an area where lots of innovation happens in hardware all the time,\u201d Coomer says. \u201cIt seemed like we should get involved in making that move forward.\u201d \n It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Valve Corporation, then doing business as Valve Software, was a simple game software maker, one of many. Founded by Microsoft alums Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington in 1996, it had a couple big hits with first-person shooters like Half-Life and Counter-Strike . The project that made Valve more than just another hotshot game developer was, at first, just a creative solution to problems that its existing customer base was having. In 2002, buying, authenticating, installing and patching PC games could be a pain in the ass. The Steam service that Valve was introducing would automate the process. Run the program on your PC and you could buy, download and maintain your Valve games automatically. Since many players would be logged in to Steam constantly, they could use it as a meeting place for game matchmaking. \n To say that it was happily ever after would be a lie. Steam began, as one story put it , as the \u201cbutt of the gaming community\u2019s jokes.\u201d The servers were overloaded at launch and Steam represented not a solution but a barrier between players and their games. It still wasn\u2019t well-liked in 2004, when Valve made a momentous but controversial decision: Its highly anticipated Half-Life 2 would require players to install and use Steam even if they bought it on a disc at a retail store. Gamers freaked out, and at first their complaints were validated, since Steam again suffered under the load of new players and gamers had to wait hours or days before their copy of the game would activate. \n This is not the way most hardware manufacturers would behave. \n And yet, somewhere along the line Steam went from boondoggle to boon. Being able to download and update games without hassle (once the kinks were ironed out) was great, especially once other publishers added their games to the service, but what really made Steam great were the prices. Steam sales sometimes let you buy full-priced games for pennies, taking full advantage of the fact that the cost of selling a copy of a digital game was effectively nothing and even a $1 sale was pure profit. 10 years and 65 million customers later, Steam has revived the PC gaming market, which had been in a death spiral when discs and CD activation keys were the only thing standing between publishers and rampant piracy. \n Saving money is one of the most enticing things about the idea of Steam in the living room. While Microsoft and Sony have greatly boosted the availability and competitive pricing of downloadable games for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 (neither console launched with the option to download full retail games, just bite-sized Arcade-type titles), they\u2019re still constrained by their relationships with brick-and-mortar retailers. They can\u2019t undercut disc game prices by too much, but Valve couldn\u2019t care less about that. \n About a year ago, Valve took the first steps out of the computer room by introducing Big Picture Mode to the Steam platform. It was a console-style interface, a way to interact with Steam from a 10-foot distance while sitting on a couch, looking at a big screen TV, holding a controller. This was a clear indication of where Valve wanted to go, but it wasn\u2019t really useful unless you were hardcore enough to actually cram a PC tower into your entertainment center. And you\u2019d have to haul a mouse and a keyboard out there too, since you were still running everything under Windows and since not all games used a gamepad \u2014 and even the ones that offered controller support still sometimes required you to set them up with a mouse. \n \u201cThis is not the way that most hardware manufacturers would behave,\u201d says Coomer. A company like Microsoft would have a \u201cmonolithic unveiling of something that has been exhaustively tested under wraps.\u201d Valve, he says, would rather introduce a piece at a time, gather customer feedback, tweak, iterate, polish, release the next piece. \n Now, Valve is ready to start sending out the pieces that should completely solve the living room problem. \n   Pages: 1 2 3 View All  \n\n  \n  \n  The Steam controller replaces the traditional joysticks and buttons with two multi-use trackpads. Photo: Matthew Ryan Williams/WIRED \n\n After our brief stroll around the office (during which we were not allowed to take photos, lest we inadvertently snap some secret project), Coomer leads me to a demo room in which more than a dozen different crazy-looking prototypes are arrayed. When Valve first began looking at input hardware, he says, it did experiments with future-tech type stuff: virtual reality, wearable computing, etc. \u201cThe very first thing we did was a pair of gloves. There\u2019s actually a tremendous amount of fidelity you can get out of gloves. But that wasn\u2019t really product thinking.\u201d \n The focus quickly turned, Coomer said, to developing a controller that would let you play Steam\u2019s entire library of games without a mouse and keyboard. This presented two distinct challenges: It needed a high-precision pointing device that would be a close substitute for a mouse pointer, which analog joysticks are not, and it needed lots and lots and lots of buttons. \n For a while, Valve produced prototype controllers that had a trackball replacing the right analog stick, eventually landing on an iteration with a giant ball that could be spun from the top (with a thumb) or the bottom (with your fingers). The ball, Coomer said, had \u201cbuilt-in haptics\u201d \u2014 you didn\u2019t need to simulate haptic feedback because you were spinning a large, heavy ball with its own momentum. It worked well. Simultaneously, Valve was playing around with touch interfaces, from simple circular trackpads for your thumbs to more complicated ideas. One abandoned idea looked like a smartphone that sat in a controller-shaped dock, and every game could have its own customized control display on the screen. Another concept was a modular controller; you could swap out the left and right inputs for a joystick, a touch pad or a trackball depending on the game. \n \u201cThe physicality of buttons combined with touch and trackpad-style input was really where the sweet spot was,\u201d Coomer said, \u201cactually serving the needs of Steam customers and the Steam catalog.\u201d Valve decided to go with two touch pads, and give game developers the ability to control, with their software, how those touch pads reacted to player input. It also designed the form factor of the controller around them. Just replacing a joystick on an Xbox 360 controller with a flat touch pad would not be a very good input method: Your thumb would lay flat against the whole pad and the game would have a very hard time figuring out what direction you were trying to push. \n When Coomer handed me the Steam controller to hold, I immediately understood what was different. The handles are curved upwards, so they keep your thumbs spaced apart from the pads. And the pads themselves are recessed and tilted inward, so only the dead center of the tip of your thumb actually makes contact. \n This is the kind of thing that is the nightmare for most PC controllers. \n But I didn\u2019t really get it until I tried it. As I sat down in front of the TV screen on the other side of the room, another Valve employee loaded up the strategy game Civilization V and handed me the controller. I passed my right thumb over the trackpad, expecting to see the mouse cursor move. And I did. But what I didn\u2019t expect is that I\u2019d feel and hear it, too. As I swiped the pad, the system of electromagnets under the pad whirred into action, firing under my thumb and making a noise like a ball rolling to a stop: cliklikliklik-click\u2014click\u2014\u2013click\u2014\u2014\u2014click . If I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d have thought I was actually rolling a trackball. \n The second piece of the puzzle: buttons. They\u2019re everywhere. There are shoulder buttons for you to hit with your index fingers, of course, but there are also \u201cback paddles\u201d that you can easily press with the fingers that go unused on traditional controllers. Each trackpad can be clicked, too, and there are an array of buttons on the face that you can access if you remove your fingers from the pads (although Valve says these are for secondary functions). Finally \u2014 although it wasn\u2019t on the prototype I was using \u2014 a small screen in the center of the controller will allow users to create their own virtual buttons to take care of any keyboard commands they can\u2019t assign to the physical controller inputs. \n \u201cThere\u2019s been, I don\u2019t know how many custom peripheral controller type things for gamers on PCs over the years,\u201d Coomer says. \u201cAn issue they have all faced, which is giant, and impeditive to their success, is the lack of a mediator like Steam between the controller and the games, so that mediator could universally make sure the controller worked well with all the games.\u201d \n At this, Coomer brings up a menu screen that will look familiar to any gamer: a controller-configuration screen where you can assign actions to each input. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that is the nightmare for most PC controllers,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause you start a game and then you\u2019re in this screen for half an hour before you ever get going. We believe we\u2019ve designed a way around that.\u201d When the controller launches, he says, players will be able to create, then share, their custom controller layouts. \n \u201cSteam users [will be] the ones driving the proliferation of configurations for all the games,\u201d he says. \u201cWe think that as we start our beta, immediately the entire Steam catalog is going to fill up with very high-quality binding sets for all the games that were never meant for use with a controller.\u201d Steam will have a system that lets players rate those bindings, and bubble the best ones to the top of the list, with the intent that most players will never have to configure their own setup. \n   Pages: 1 2 3 View All  \n\n  \n  \n  The inside of Valve\u2019s prototype Steam Machine, which it will send to 300 beta testers from the Steam community this year. Photo: Matthew Ryan Williams/WIRED \n\n Sitting underneath the television across from me is the Steam Machine \u2014 not one of the models that Valve\u2019s heretofore unnamed hardware partners will announce at CES, but a prototype built by Valve that it will be sending out to 300 lucky beta participants, hand-selected from the Steam community\u2019s most engaged users. It looks like a console, not a PC, about the shape and size of an Xbox One with a big glowing power button on the face. \u201cThese are the components that someone would put into a traditional tower PC,\u201d Coomer says, including an Nvidia 780 graphics card that, as an open model of the machine on a table next to me shows, takes up fully half the space inside. \n \u201cWe did a bunch of work to put it into this package,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be really careful of heat.\u201d Valve has separated this prototype into three different zones, he says, each thermally isolated from the others. Each zone has its own intake and outtake to handle the heat. I put my face next to the one running on the entertainment center; it is cool and quiet. \n This prototype, were it for sale, would cost about as much as a high-end gaming PC, Coomer says. \u201cThe video card in there is hundreds of dollars. But in 2014, there\u2019s going to be a whole array of prices,\u201d he says. \u201cMost people don\u2019t want a box that matches this description.\u201d \n \u201cWe think it\u2019ll be valuable to customers to have an open ecosystem on the hardware side,\u201d says Anna Sweet, who does business development for Valve, \u201cbeing able to pick the box that\u2019s the right size and the right performance \u2026 but still have that consistency of experience and content and community with Steam.\u201d \n And because these machines will run SteamOS, a specialized operating system just for game playing, Valve says it can dole out more bang for the buck. \u201cWe\u2019re able to get more performance out of graphics hardware \u2026 by running on Linux and having worked so hard on the graphics drivers, not just for compatibility and bug fixing but for optimizing performance,\u201d Coomer says. \u201cFor our own games, we\u2019re seeing significant speed-up in terms of framerate at the same graphics settings.\u201d Valve has also made progress in the areas of input and audio latency, he said. \u201cGoing to the driver level and having access to the full operating system lets us tune things specifically for gaming.\u201d \n  Portraits of the characters from Valve\u2019s hit shooter Team Fortress 2 line the hallway that leads to the bathroom in the lobby of Valve\u2019s Bellevue office. Photo: Matthew Ryan Williams/WIRED \n The OS \n There\u2019s still one last problem, and it\u2019s largely out of Valve\u2019s control. It can make a new controller, it can send out Steam Machines, but it can\u2019t force gamemakers to port their games over to the new OS. The Steam Machines will be set up to stream games off your existing desktop PC, but ultimately their success will hinge on getting publishers to create custom Linux versions of their games that can be played on SteamOS. \n And that\u2019s been slow going, thus far. There might be over 3,000 games on Steam, but only about a tenth of those run on Linux. And besides Valve\u2019s own games, few of them are the big triple-A blockbusters. Mostly, they\u2019re indie games; some of them are well-known to game enthusiasts ( Fez , Don\u2019t Starve ) but none are household words. \n Will big publishers \u2014 not to mention small developers for whom ports can be much more expensive, relatively \u2014 add SteamOS to the already large list of potential platforms for their titles? Anna Sweet says that the recent proliferation of incompatible game machines might actually work in Valve\u2019s favor. \n Apple remains a very real threat that could upset the next round of games consoles the same way Wii did. \n \u201cI actually think we\u2019re at an advantage right now because there are so many other platforms out there,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of publishers and developers have already done the work that makes it easy to build their games for multiple platforms. Doing that work to add another platform that they see as valuable is not as much work as it may have been in the past.\u201d If you\u2019ve ported your PC game to the Mac, Sweet said, \u201cyou\u2019ve done a lot of the work that\u2019s required to move to \u2026 Linux.\u201d \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to announce today, but we have lots of partners who are on board and excited,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cMost of them are happy to see that sort of open platform experience extend into the living room.\u201d As an example, Valve showed me a SteamOS version of this year\u2019s popular first-person shooter Metro: Last Light . Apart from being an example of a major hit game coming to Linux, it also gave me an opportunity to try the Steam Controller on a first-person shooter. (There\u2019s a bit more of a learning curve when the game itself is difficult and fast-paced; I got mauled by radioactive dogs a bit more than I\u2019d like to admit.) \n Linux, Valve\u2019s cofounder and big boss Gabe Newell said at the DICE summit at the beginning of this year, is a \u201cget out of jail free pass for our industry, if we need it.\u201d Newell has been a vocal critic of Windows 8 (\u201ca catastrophe\u201d), PlayStation 3 (\u201ctotal disaster\u201d) \u2014 anything that doesn\u2019t represent his ideal of a free and open platform for developers. (Although he is not shy about voicing his unvarnished opinions, Newell also often rebuffs requests for publicity \u2014 he initially agreed to speak with WIRED for this story, but when we arrived at Valve\u2019s headquarters we were informed that he had pulled out of the interview.) \n Apple, Newell said at that conference, is \u201cmore threatening to the PC in the living room than anything that would be happening on the console side.\u201d While Apple has still yet to announce the long-rumored Apple TV update that will bring its App Store gaming environment to the living room, it remains a very real threat that could upset the next round of game consoles the same way Wii did during the last generation. \n \u201cIf you pressed us to say, who are the players in the living room who could curtail what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d says Greg Coomer, \u201cwe spend probably more time thinking about Apple and the success that they\u2019ve had upending the PC space with tablets. They could bring a lot of energy to bear on the living room, more than they have. And if they did that in a certain way that sucked all the oxygen out of the space for us for a while, we may have more of an uphill road to get as many customers well served. So we think about that.\u201d \n \u201cWe don\u2019t do much in the way of competitive analysis when we\u2019re that confident about delivering value,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly just taking a fairly well-educated leap of faith that enough of our customers have been asking for this kind of thing that it\u2019s absolutely worth the experiment to go bring this stuff to market.\u201d \n Ah, yes: Those 65 million users, the ones who make Valve more than just another competitor looking to wrest control of the TV away from Sony and Microsoft. In fact, Valve wouldn\u2019t even describe themselves as wanting that. It\u2019s just about adding a new way to play Steam games, one they say they\u2019re reasonably sure that a big enough portion of their sizable base of loyal fans wants to use. But if they\u2019re right \u2014 and if that virtuous cycle gets going, bringing in more players, more games, more players, more games, etc. \u2014 in a few years, Steam Machines might be eating a meaningful portion of Sony\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s lunch. But for now, Valve\u2019s focused on its existing customers. \n \u201cAt first, it\u2019s all about that,\u201d says Coomer. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll see where that leads.\u201d \n   Pages: 1 2 3 View All", "topics": [], "author": "Chris Kohler", "wordCount": 3701}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "Mass Killings Can Haunt Elephants for Decades", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/334a00d6/sc/40/l/0L0Swired0N0Cwiredscience0C20A130C110Celephants0Ehaunted0Eby0Ekilling0C/story01.htm", "text": "Image: Graeme Shannon \n African elephants that have lived through the trauma of a cull\u2014or selected killing of their kin\u2014may look normal enough to the casual observer, but socially they are a mess. That\u2019s the conclusion of a new study, the first to show that human activities can disrupt the social skills of large-brained mammals that live in complex societies for decades. The finding, experts say, has implications for conservation management, which often solely focuses on the number of animals in a population, and may extend to chimpanzees, dolphins, whales, and other species. \n  \u201cIt is a groundbreaking study, because it is the first to demonstrate, experimentally, a direct connection between the effects of culling and specific psychosocial harms,\u201d says Lori Marino, a neuroscientist and expert on dolphin behavior at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved with the research. \u201cIt shows unequivocally that elephants are psychologically damaged by culling.\u201d \n Wildlife officials often used culling as a conservation tool in South Africa from the 1960s to the 1990s. (It is still reserved as a management tool there.) At the time, wildlife managers worried that if there were too many elephants in a fenced reserve, like the famed Kruger National Park, the behemoths would ultimately destroy the habitat, eating or trampling all the vegetation and uprooting the trees. During a cull, a helicopter pilot herds an elephant family into a tight bunch. Professional hunters on the ground then shoot the animals as quickly as possible. Only young elephants ranging from about 4 to 10 years old are saved. Park officials typically shipped them to other parks that lacked elephants or had smaller populations to increase the herds, because elephants are popular with tourists. \n \u201cSome of these elephants ended up in Pilanesberg National Park,\u201d in South Africa\u2019s North West Province where part of the new study was carried out, says Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, and the lead author of the new study. \u201cTwenty to 30 years have passed since the actual cull and relocation.\u201d \n Scientists have known since the late 1990s that many of these elephants were psychologically affected by their experiences during the culling. Other studies have described these effects as akin to posttraumatic stress disorder. For instance, the orphaned male elephants at Pilanesberg and another reserve made headlines for attacking and killing 107 rhinoceroses over a 10-year period, something that elephants had never been reported to do. Other researchers who study male elephants attributed the young males\u2019 abnormal behavior to their surging hormones and lack of social learning\u2014both of which were controlled after older male elephants were introduced. In some instances, the orphaned female elephants were also hyperaggressive and attacked tourist vehicles. But they, too, apparently recovered and went on to form family groups, although these groups sometimes include unrelated individuals, which is unusual in elephants. \n \u201cOn the surface, they look like they\u2019re now getting on okay,\u201d says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom and a co-author of the study. \u201cBut we found a way to go deeper into their minds, and that\u2019s how we found the deficits in the social decisions that they make.\u201d \n From studies of the relatively undisturbed population of elephants in Kenya\u2019s Amboseli National Park, scientists know that social learning is important to these animals. In their family groups, the oldest female is the guiding matriarch, and she passes on to younger members behaviors such as how to greet family members and how to react to the calls of strange females. \n The researchers compared the reactions of 14 Pilanesberg elephant families and 39 elephant families in Amboseli to different levels of social threats. For each test, they positioned their Land Rover 100 meters away from a family group and broadcast an elephant\u2019s deep-throated greeting call for 10 to 20 seconds. The calls were from familiar or unfamiliar elephants or were resynthesized calls that were made to sound like individuals of specific age classes. (You can listen to examples here .) These tests gauged the elephants\u2019 ability to make the best decision when faced with what could be a major threat: an older, dominant, strange female. Such animals can pose a danger to a family by forcing them, for instance, to leave areas where they are feeding, McComb says. \n The scientists video-recorded the families\u2019 reactions to the various calls and measured certain key behaviors, such as whether the elephants defensively bunched together, whether they listened and smelled for the stranger, and how much time they spent doing these activities. \n When the researchers played the calls to the Amboseli elephants, almost every family responded appropriately to the rumbles of the older, unfamiliar female. Typically, the entire family froze in place. The members raised their ears to listen and their trunks to sniff for the invader. They turned toward the vehicle and bunched together, forming a fortress of elephant flesh with the matriarch in front. Sometimes, they charged past the scientist\u2019s vehicle, searching for the alien hussy. \u201cYou get the feeling they really know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d McComb says. \u201cThey have very coordinated responses.\u201d \n In contrast, the Pilanesberg elephants never seemed to know what to do. \u201cThe pattern there was no pattern at all; their reactions were completely random,\u201d McComb says. In one extreme instance, a family left the area at once, traveling more than a kilometer before they came to a halt\u2014but they did so in response to the call of an elephant they all knew. \u201cYet when they heard the call of the older, strange female, they did nothing at all; they just stayed completely relaxed,\u201d Shannon says. \n \u201cYou might think because of their history that they were just more accepting of strangers,\u201d McComb says. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t that. They simply failed at picking out the calls of older, socially dominant animals.\u201d \n Because the Pilanesberg elephants grew up without the social knowledge of their original families, they will likely never properly respond to social threats and may even pass on their inappropriate behaviors to the next generation, the team concludes in the current issue of Frontiers in Zoology . And it may be that elephant populations that are heavily poached or otherwise adversely affected by human activities are similarly socially damaged, they say. \n All of this matters because poor decision-making can affect the elephants\u2019 reproductive success, McComb says. A previous study that she and others carried out in Amboseli compared the decision-making abilities of younger and older matriarchs. Those families led by the oldest individuals with the most experience also had the most calves. Exactly how the poor decisions of the Pilanesberg elephants will affect them in the future is as yet unknown. \u201cWhat we now know is that their social understanding is most certainly impaired,\u201d McComb says. \n The team\u2019s findings \u201cmay also apply to other species, such as cetaceans and nonhuman primates\u201d that have been and, in some cases, continue to be heavily managed, Marino says. They also show \u201cunequivocally that conservation that is only based on numbers,\u201d that is, on how many animals are in a population, \u201cand which does not take into account the individual ends in disaster.\u201d \n Richard Connor, a cetacean biologist at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, adds: \u201cIt is difficult to not conclude that the legal killing or illegal poaching of elephants is not only inhumane, it is barbaric.\u201d \n This story provided by Science NOW, the daily online news service of the journal Science.", "topics": [], "author": "Virginia Morell, ScienceNOW", "wordCount": 1233}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "See the Dramatic Evolution of Valve's Steam Controller", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/33495866/sc/27/l/0L0Swired0N0Cgamelife0C20A130C110Cvalve0Esteam0Econtroller0C/story01.htm", "text": "BELLEVUE, Washington -- If you want to see how Valve created its innovative new Steam Controller for PC gaming, it all starts here: with something that looks like a bar of soap. \n In late October, WIRED was invited to the offices of Valve Corporation in Bellevue, outside of Seattle, for a hands-on preview of the company's plan to bring its Steam PC gaming service into the living room. It's already unveiled Big Picture, a Steam interface built for the TV. Later this year, it will beta test Steam Machines, PC gaming hardware in a living-room form factor. And to control it all, Valve has come up with the Steam Controller, which lets players control games that were meant to use a keyboard and mouse setup from the comfort of their couch, using high-resolution touch pads. \n Valve product designer Greg Coomer walked us through the evolution of the controller, showing us numerous prototypes that the company cooked up over the past two years and explaining how each one led it a little bit closer to the final design. Here's what we saw. \n Above : This early mockup was a first stab at the question of how to control a game that might require a 120-button keyboard in the living room: \"What if we put buttons under all of your fingers?\" said Coomer. While this particular form factor -- individual buttons for each finger -- didn't last, the final controller does have \"back paddle\" buttons that you press in this manner. \n Many of the controller prototype iterations, laid out in rough chronological order from left to right. One controller, shown at upper left, was a break-apart motion controller. The left side was attached by magnets and could break off from the unit to function as a Wii Remote-type of one-handed motion controller. \n \"This was very functional, not just for looking at,\" said Coomer. \"Hopefully that's obvious, that this thing was wired to work and that we did a bunch of gameplay testing around all of these devices.\" \n One controller concept that Valve stuck with for a long time was the idea of having a trackball on the right side of the controller, to substitute for a mouse pointer. \n As Valve continued to prototype the trackball controllers, the ball got larger and larger and larger: \"We found that the larger physical ball was a huge win,\" said Coomer. Eventually they ended up with one that was so large it actually went all the way through the controller and could be spun with your ring and pinky fingers. \n \"Having two fingers lets you do quick stops, it lets you pick up your thumb, put it somewhere else while you're still moving the ball around with your finger, or vice versa, because there are buttons back here,\" Coomer said. \n A 3-D printed prototype. Valve has many 3-D printers in its office and produced mockups like this on a regular basis, Coomer said. \n Eventually, Valve decided to use trackpads to emulate a trackball. This would give developers more freedom in terms of how they used the inputs, Coomer said. \n \"When you start simulating physical devices like thumbsticks or like trackballs, and include things like momentum so you can flick the ball and it'll spin in a virtual way, then it becomes really powerful,\" said Coomer. \"Especially when you consider how many titles there are on Steam and how many different kinds of input they require.\" \n Early attempts at trackpad controllers, Coomer said, showed some of the flaws of the setup. If the trackpads and controllers were flat-shaped, your thumbs would hit almost the entire trackpad at once, as he demonstrated here. This made it very difficult for a computer to reliably tell where you were trying to point. \n A near-final (but not quite) version of the Steam Controller. The trackpads are bent inwards and the handles curve up so that only the dead centers of your thumbs make contact with the pads, leading to greater accuracy.", "topics": [], "author": "Chris Kohler", "wordCount": 658}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "Why Laws Restricting Soda Sales Make Perfect Scientific Sense", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/33487ee3/sc/8/l/0L0Swired0N0Cwiredscience0C20A130C110Cbloomberg0Esoda0Eban0Ereturns0C/story01.htm", "text": "Image: Daniel Oines /Flickr \n More than a year after its ill-fated introduction, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s plan to limit soda sizes just won\u2019t go away. If anything, it\u2019s putting on weight. Both San Francisco and Mexico are considering their own soda restrictions \u2014 and though their plans might run into the same opposition that Bloomberg\u2019s did, it won\u2019t be coming from public health experts. \n \u201cIn a way, we are what we drink in terms of obesity,\u201d said nutritionist Barry Popkin of the University of North Carolina. Soda and other high-sugar beverages aren\u2019t the only problem, but they\u2019re \u201cthe first and easiest target.\u201d \n Bloomberg\u2019s proposal, which was approved by New York City\u2019s Board of Health in September of last year, would have banned the sale of sugary drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces by the city\u2019s fast food restaurants, movie theaters and street vendors. The plan became a national laughingstock, derided by both liberals and conservatives \u2014 critics included Jon Stewart and John Boehner \u2014 as technocratic, nanny-state overreach. A New York state court ultimately overturned the restriction, arguing that Bloomberg had exceeded his legal reach. \n\n Bloomberg appealed the decision, and New York state\u2019s highest court agreed this month to hear the case . Even if they don\u2019t bring the ban back, though, poll-leading mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio has pledged to make it happen . The city of San Francisco is also considering a soda tax , and Mexico, which recently edged out the United States as the world\u2019s fattest country , is considering its own Bloomberg-inspired soda restriction . \n Another round of public discussion over beverage regulation seems imminent. The first time around, though, most of the talk was political, emphasizing debates over the role of government and importance of consumer freedom. Rather less attention was paid to whether restrictions might actually make people healthier. \u201cThis is a very important public health area,\u201d said Frank Hu, an obesity epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public health, but public discussion \u201chas kind of been dominated by political considerations.\u201d \n 'In a way, we are what we drink in terms of obesity.' As for the scientific discussion, it\u2019s been dominated by the basic fact that Americans drink massively more sugar-sweetened beverages \u2014 the term of art for non-diet sodas, fruit juices, Frappucinos and Slurpees and so on \u2014 than just a few decades ago. Consumption has more than doubled since the late 1970s ; the average child or adolescent gets 270 calories per day, or between 10 and 15 percent of all their calories, from sugary drinks.\n Some scientific questions do remain as to whether sugar is uniquely problematic , triggering physiologic changes specific to sugar metabolism, or simply represent excess calories. Even if sugar isn\u2019t toxic, though, raw caloric volume is problem enough. Sugar drinks represent more than half of the approximately 500 extra daily calories Americans now consume in comparison to late-1970s baselines. \n Until a few years ago, said Hu, it was theoretically possible to argue that the increased sugar consumption played a minor role in obesity and related disorders, or was even irrelevant. Correlation isn\u2019t causation; obese people with diabetes tended to drink more sugar drinks than healthy people, but maybe they just had a taste for it. But the bulk of evidence, including two gold-standard randomized clinical trials published in 2012 in the New England Journal of Medicine , in which cutting soda intake led to long-term body mass reductions , underscores the role of the drinks. \n \u201cPeople who argue against the scientific evidence still say that sugar-sweetened beverages are not the main problem, that other dietary factors are also important, that sedentary lifestyles are responsible. And those are all true: obesity is caused by many factors, not just one,\u201d Hu said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that sugar-sweetened beverages are one of the most important factors that increases caloric intake in our country \u2014 and it\u2019s relatively easy to cut back on them.\u201d \n As for what effect restrictions would have in a country where 25 percent of adults are obese , 8 percent have diabetes , as many as 34 percent have some metabolic syndrome , and total obesity-related costs topping $150 billion per year , it\u2019s impossible to predict with absolute certainty, but rough numbers do exist. \n A recent study in Health Affairs estimated that a nationwide one-percent tax on sugary drinks would over the next ten years prevent up to 240,00 cases of diabetes, 95,00 cases of heart disease, 8,000 strokes and 26,000 premature deaths. Some $17 billion could be saved in medical costs. For New York City, other researchers calculated that Bloomberg\u2019s ban would, on any given day, affect more than 7 percent of all New Yorkers , the number that presently drink more than 16 ounces of soda daily from businesses covered by the restrictions. They would consume nearly 60 fewer calories per day. \n An useful rule of thumb, said epidemiologist Claire Wang of Columbia University, a co-author of both studies, is that each long-term daily reduction of 10 calories translates to to a one-pound weight loss. \u201cFor 100 calories, you\u2019ll probably be looking at a 10-pound weight difference,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated in kids, but that rule works well for adults.\u201d When McDonald\u2019s first started selling soda, noted Wang, the regular size was 7 ounces , less than half the size of the restaurant\u2019s current small soda. \n Wang\u2019s models do rest on two critical assumptions: For the tax, that increased prices lead to reduced consumption; and for Bloomberg\u2019s ban, that people won\u2019t simply buy more than one 16-ounce beverage, or make up for lost soda in the comfort of their homes. Popkin said the first is true, with soda consumption being very sensitive to price changes, and research by psychologists does suggest that smaller portion sizes really does lead to reduced consumption . \n Whether the potential health benefits of Bloomberg\u2019s plan for New York City, or the restrictions in San Francisco and Mexico, outweigh the political objections, remains to be seen. Yet even if many people have objected to the restrictions, said Hu, it\u2019s worth remembering that tobacco regulations were once criticized as violating cherished freedoms. \n \u201cFifteen or twenty years ago, nobody would have imagined not being able to smoke in a bar, or in public places,\u201d Hu said. \u201cObesity is much more complicated than smoking, but it serves as a good example of how public policies can make a huge difference in changing social norms and improving public health.\u201d \n Image: Daniel Oines /Flickr", "topics": [], "author": "Brandon Keim", "wordCount": 1067}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "feeds.wired.com", "title": "We're About to Lose Net Neutrality &mdash; And the Internet as We Know It", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/33487ee2/sc/4/l/0L0Swired0N0Copinion0C20A130C110Cso0Ethe0Einternets0Eabout0Eto0Elose0Eits0Enet0Eneutrality0C/story01.htm", "text": "Net neutrality is a dead man walking.

He is also the cofounder of a startup, Wearab.ly, which enables content to be distributed to wearable devices. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Ammori serves on the boards of Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, and Engine Advocacy.\u00a0 Fast Company \u00a0named him one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2012 for being Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cgo-to First Amendment guy\u201d and one of the leaders of the campaign against SOPA and PIPA. \n \n\n \n Game of Loopholes and Rules \n How did we get here? \n The CEO of AT&T told an interviewer back in 2005 that he wanted to introduce a new business model to the internet: charging companies like Google and Yahoo! to reliably reach internet users on the AT&T network. Keep in mind that users already pay to access the internet and that Google and Yahoo! already pay other telecom companies \u2014 often called backbone providers \u2014 to connect to these internet users. [Disclosure: I have done legal work for several companies supporting network neutrality, including Google.] \n But AT&T wanted to add an additional toll, beyond what it already made from the internet. Shortly after that, a Verizon executive voiced agreement, hoping to end what he called tech companies\u2019 \u201cfree lunch\u201d. It turns out that around the same time, Comcast had begun secretly trialing services to block some of the web\u2019s most popular applications that could pose a competitive threat to Comcast, such as BitTorrent. \n Yet the phone and cable companies tried to dress up their plans as a false compromise. Counterintuitively, they supported telecommunications legislation in 2006 that would authorize the FCC to stop phone and cable companies from blocking websites. \n There was a catch, however. The bills included an exception that swallowed the rule: the FCC would be unable to stop cable and phone companies from taxing innovators or providing worse service to some sites and better service to others. Since we know internet users tend to quit using a website or application if it loads even just a few seconds slower than a competitor\u2019s version, this no-blocking rule would essentially have enabled the phone and cable companies to discriminate by picking website/app/platform winners and losers. (Congress would merely enact the loophole. Think of it as a safe harbor for discriminating online.) \n Luckily, consumer groups, technology companies, political leaders, and American citizens saw through the nonsense and rallied around a principle to preserve the internet\u2019s openness. They advocated for one simple, necessary rule \u2014 a nondiscrimination principle that became known as \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d. This principle would forbid phone and cable companies not only from blocking \u2014 but also from discriminating between or entering in special business deals to the benefit of \u2014 some sites over others. \n Unfortunately, the FCC decision that included the nondiscrimination rule still had major loopholes \u2014 especially when it came to mobile networks. \n Both sides battled out the issues before Congress, federal agencies, and in several senate and presidential campaigns over the next five years. These fights culminated in the 2010 FCC decision that included the nondiscrimination rule. \n Unfortunately, the rule still had major loopholes \u2014 especially when it came to mobile networks. It also was built, to some extent, on a shaky political foundation because the then-FCC chairman repeatedly folded when facing pressure. Still, the adopted rule was better than nothing, and it was a major advance over AT&T\u2019s opening bid in 2005 of a no-blocking rule. \n As a result, Verizon took the FCC to court to void the 2010 FCC rule. Verizon went to court to attack the part of the rule forbidding them from discriminating among websites and applications; from setting up \u2014 on what we once called the information superhighway \u2014 the equivalents of tollbooths, fast lanes, and dirt roads. \n There and Back Again \n So that\u2019s where we are today \u2014 waiting for the most powerful court in the nation, the DC Circuit, to rule in Verizon\u2019s case. During the case\u2019s oral argument, back in early September, corporate lobbyists, lawyers, financial analysts, and consumer advocates packed into the courtroom: some sitting, some standing, some relegated to an overflow room. \n Since then, everyone interested in internet freedom has been waiting for an opinion \u2014 including everyday folks who search the web or share their thoughts in 140 characters; and including me, who argued the first (losing) network neutrality case before the DC Circuit in 2010. \n Web and mobile companies will live or die not on the merits of their technology, but on the deals they can strike with AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and others. \n But, in their questions and statements during oral argument, the judges have made clear how they planned to rule \u2014 for the phone and cable companies, not for those who use the internet. While the FCC has the power to impose the toothless \u201cno-blocking\u201d rule (originally proposed by AT&T above), it does not (the court will say) have the power to impose the essential \u201cnondiscrimination\u201d rule. \n It looks like we\u2019ll end up where AT&T initially began: a false compromise. \n The implications of such a decision would be profound. Web and mobile companies will live or die not on the merits of their technology and design, but on the deals they can strike with AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and others. This means large phone and cable companies will be able to \u201cshakedown\u201d startups and established companies in every sector, requiring payment for reliable service. In fact, during the oral argument in the current case, Verizon\u2019s lawyer said, \u201cI\u2019m authorized to state from my client today that but for these [FCC] rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.\u201d \n Wait, it gets even worse. Pricing isn\u2019t even a necessary forcing factor. Once the court voids the nondiscrimination rule, AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast will be able to deliver some sites and services more quickly and reliably than others for any reason . Whim. Envy. Ignorance. Competition. Vengeance. Whatever. Or, no reason at all. \n So what if you\u2019ve got a great new company, an amazing group of founders, a seat in a reputable accelerator program, great investors and mentors. With the permission-based innovation over \u201cour pipes\u201d desired from the likes of Comcast, Verizon and AT&T\u2026 there\u2019s no meritocracy here. \n Of course, despite everything the judges suggested during the two-hour argument, it\u2019s possible that they offer net neutrality a reprieve. Given how sticky this morass is, there\u2019s one simple way for you to judge the opinion: If the court throws out the non-discrimination rule, permission-less innovation on the internet as we know it is done. If the nondiscrimination rule miraculously survives, then, for now at least, so too will freedom on the internet.", "topics": [], "author": "Marvin Ammori", "wordCount": 1368}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "These Pics of Nail Polish Look Like Galaxies and Nebulae", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/33487ed8/sc/38/l/0L0Swired0N0Cdesign0C20A130C110Cis0Ethis0Ea0Enew0Egalaxy0Eor0Ethe0Egreatest0Emanicure0Eever0C/story01.htm", "text": "Fashion photographer Chris Peun has figured out how to make an uncanny facsimile of the Crab Nebula by mixing up a few bottles of nail polish and shooting the results.

Photo: ray k. \n If you were to sit down at a computer in Germany, you\u2019d find that the operating system, including the menus and dialog boxes, is in German. You\u2019d also find that most of the applications are in German as well. And if you open an app that deals with money, it\u2019ll deal in metric Euros, not dollars and cents. \n You probably don\u2019t think much about it, but when American software is used overseas, it often needs translating into another language, and that\u2019s not easy. For many developers, it\u2019s a full-time job, and it can be a moving target. Every time the development team makes a change to an application, it too must be internationalized. \n For Square \u2014 the company behind those handy credit card readers for smart phones and tablets \u2014 internationalization is a complex ordeal. Not only does all the text have to be translated, but local currencies and tax laws must be accounted for. When Square started its first internationalization project last year, the company called in Tim Morgan, an engineer who had started at the company a few months before. \n \u2018We started by looking at the tools that the translators used already, which were old and mostly ran only on Windows 98.\u2019\n \u2014 Tim Morgan \n \n \u201cI started at Square as their inaugural internal tools developer,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cAfter finishing my first project, I had no idea what I was going to work on. They came to me and told me that as part of the Canada launch they were experiencing a lot of pain in terms of internationalization, but I\u2019d never done internationalization.\u201d \n What he came up with is Shuttle , a project management system for software translators. And now it\u2019s free and open source so that any company or development team can use it to bring their software to the world. \n Morgan speaks a little German and took some linguistics classes in college, but he\u2019s far from being a translator. So his first order of business was sitting down with Square\u2019s internationalization team to figure out what was going wrong. \u201cWe started by looking at the tools that the translators used already, which were old and mostly ran only on Windows 98,\u201d he says. \u201cWe spoke with them and asked about their pain points.\u201d \n Morgan had the translators test different versions of the Shuttle interface until it worked the way they wanted. After two months of interface testing and six months of development, Shuttle was ready for production. \u201cWe did Japan right after Canada, and that went smoothly,\u201d he says. \n \u201cThe tools we need to quickly and accurately translate our codebase are in Shuttle,\u201d says Domitille Lee, a French language specialist at Square. \u201cShuttle has sped up development at Square, and the strong translation memory helps with consistency\u2014leaving us to do what we do best, crafting words.\u201d \n Every time a Square developer commits some code, Shuttle scans the entire code base for content that needs to be translated. The translation team then gets a list of content that needs to be translated, and a recommendation engine identifies content that has been translated before. \n Unlike Google Translate, Shuttle\u2019s translation recommendation engine doesn\u2019t do any computerized translations. It\u2019s based entirely on previous human-created translations. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do anything that would introduce too much complacency in the process, so we\u2019re using strictly human translation for now,\u201d Morgan says. \n Eventually, though, he\u2019d like to add \u201cfuzzy matching\u201d to the recommendation engine to provide translation possibilities for content that isn\u2019t a 100 percent match with something that has been previously translated. \u201cWe have an engine for doing partial matches, but there\u2019s no user interface yet,\u201d he says. \n Shuttle also includes a human-curated glossary of terms. Square has about 30 translators, a mix of full-time employees and contractors, so the glossary keeps everyone using consistent terminology. There\u2019s also one reviewer for each language the company supports \u2014 so far just French and Japanese \u2014 who signs off on each piece of translated content. \u201cIt\u2019s also a tracking tool that makes sure that everything is fully translated; it sets a high bar,\u201d Morgan says. \n Shuttle only facilitates the translation stage of internationalization. Adjusting for local currencies and tax laws requires even more work, but Shuttle at least makes one part of the whole process easier for Square.", "topics": [], "author": "Klint Finley", "wordCount": 730}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "Ender's Game</em> vs. The Hunger Games</em>: A Military Analysis", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/3346bea2/sc/19/l/0L0Swired0N0Cunderwire0C20A130C110Cender0Ehunger0Egames0Emilitary0C/story01.htm", "text": "Ender Wiggin is a natural at knowing how to move starship fleets in an alien war. Katniss Everdeen is lethal with a bow and arrow, and capable of starting a revolution. Combined they might make the best commander-in-chief of all time that's not old enough to vote. With the film adaptation of Ender's Game now in theaters and The Hunger Games sequel, Catching Fire , opening later this month, two of the most notable military minds in film and pop culture right now also happen to be underage. \n But how similar are the battle strategies of Ender Wiggin and Katniss Everdeen? From the siblings they fight to protect to the lessons they learn from their forbears, Ender and Katniss actually have quite a bit in common \u2013 though, obviously, not everything. WIRED scoured the books, consulted military history, and talked to Navy chief petty officer Timothy Bruns, the military adviser on Ender's Game, for insight into how these two young freedom fighters stack up. (Minor spoilers for Ender's Game and The Hunger Games series follow.) \n Leading by Example \n\n Ender Wiggin : \"Ender is a leader that leads from the front,\" said Bruns. \"Leaders that lead by example are more effective because they have a better understanding of what their people are going through and the challenges that they might face.\" In Orson Scott Card's original book, when Ender begins commanding some of his fellow students his squad trusts him because he was once one of them \u2013 even though \"their friendship, remembered from the Battle School days, gradually disappeared.\" \n Katniss Everdeen : Similarly, Katniss finds herself as the unwitting leader of an uprising against the government after she emerges from the Games as a symbol of victory \u2013 and rebellion. Her example, particularly as a teenager from an impoverished district of Panem, inspires her fellow citizens to revolt. \n Photos: Summit Entertainment (left) and Murray Close/Lionsgate (right) \n Going to War to Protect Their Siblings \n\n One very clear line of comparison between Ender Wiggin and Katniss Everdeen is their fierce protectiveness of their siblings. Like soldiers in any war, they may be fighting much bigger battles for their planet/country but they do it in an attempt to save their families. \n Ender Wiggin: Throughout his training in Battle School, Ender thinks often about his older sister Valentine. When his Battle School overseers want to get him back on his game \u2013 so to speak \u2013 they take him to see his sister back on Earth. In the book, she tells him that if he doesn't complete his training to win the alien war then he will have \"killed us all.\" He soon resumes his military duties. \"So that's why you brought me here \u2026 to make me love Earth,\" Ender thinks in Card's novel. \"Well, it worked. \u2026 Valentine, too; she was another one of your tricks, to make me remember that I'm not going to school for myself. Well, I remember.\" \n Katniss Everdeen: The only reason Katniss went to the Hunger Games was to take the place of her milquetoast-but-working-on-it sister, Prim. Her sacrifice helped Katniss win the hearts of Panem, by saying that she promised her sister she would try to survive the Games so that she could come home to her family. Based on the trailer for Catching Fire (below), this thread continues in the next film in the series with Katniss telling Prim, \"whatever I do, it comes back to you and mom \u2013 I don't want you to get hurt.\" \n \n Photo: Murray Close/Lionsgate \n Fighting on Multiple Fronts \n\n In standard military terminology a \"two-front war\" is a war fought on two geographically different battle fields. But \u2013 unlike Napoleon, who just had to wage battles in Europe and Russia \u2013 in The Hunger Games and Ender's Game the fights are often in geographically different places and in somewhat psychologically different ones as well. \n Ender Wiggin: Ultimately, Ender has been brought to Battle School in order to train to lead his young forces in a war against the Formics/buggers. While training, his various platoons must face off against other \"toons\" of young people, often much older and more experienced, while also sparring with the school's head Col. Graff. In the Ender's film, Graff has to remind him \"I'm not the enemy.\" These struggles are mentally taxing on Ender \u2013 like Katniss, he doesn't sleep much \u2013 allowing him to simultaneously master the strategy of real war and the inherent power struggles that often accompany it. As retired Air Force colonel Tom Ruby noted in his essay \"Ender on Leadership\" it causes him to \"fight against his own leadership while preparing to fight the Formics .\" Luckily, he's a smart enough strategist to manage more than one battle. \n Katniss Everdeen: When she's participating in the Hunger Games, Katniss is ostensibly fighting against other tributes from her neighboring districts. But outside of the arenas where the Games happen, there is a much more real battle happening between the Capitol and the Districts, where people look to Katniss as a beacon of hope. Because she is their accidental revolutionary, the Capitol tries repeatedly to break her down mentally and physically, including by sending her back into the arena for the Quarter Quell. But she's not the only one who is a pawn, the rest of the tributes are too. It is this mentality that leads her mentor Haymitch to tell her to \"remember who the enemy is\" (\"remember who the real enemy is\" in the film, or at least the trailer) before she enters her second Games in Catching Fire . \n Photo: Murray Close/Lionsgate \n Disorienting the Enemy With Chaos \n\n Ender Wiggin: Bruns, who actually helped the cast of Ender's Game train in military protocol at Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama, notes that Ender's greatest strategic skill is something called the Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act (OODA) loop . Developed by military strategist John Boyd \u2013 aka \" the fighter pilot who changed the art of war \" \u2013 its core tenet holds that to win a person should watch and react to the enemy in such a way that they operate at a quicker pace than their adversary \u2013 creating a chaos that makes it hard for the enemy to anticipate your moves or react. \"Ender applies many different and effective military strategies throughout this film,\" Bruns said. \"In my opinion what sets him apart is his ability to utilize OODA loop ... I believe Ender took this strategy and applied it to many of the situations that he found himself in. \n Katniss Everdeen: While Katniss does employ the OODA loop from time to time (dropping a tracker jacker nest on one's rivals is pretty disorienting), she doesn't use it as effectively as Wiggin does \u2013 especially since it might be his signature skill. Instead, she's far more effective at defensive tactics than offensive ones, and often survives thanks to evasive maneuvering (a method long employed on Star Trek \u2013 and simply getting out of the way of enemy fire. At the start of her first Games, for example, she immediately runs as far away from the other tributes as she can, and later evades the Career tributes simply by climbing a really, really tall tree. \n Learning From Strong Mentors \n\n Every great leader probably, at some point, had to learn from someone. Even Dwight D. Eisenhower, before World War II and before the presidency, had Fox Connor . Our young heroes here are no different. In fact, both had more than one mentor. Ender's Colonel Hyrum Graff and Katniss' Haymitch both teach their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s by making them figure things out for themselves, while Mazer Rackham and Cinna help Ender and Katniss, respectively, in more nurturing ways. \n Ender Wiggin: Anyone who's seen the trailer for Ender's Game gets the general gist of the relationship between Ender's two mentors, Graff (played by Harrison Ford) and Rackham (played by Ben Kingsley). Mazer is a careful teacher, who wants to help coach him until he's absolutely ready. Graff, on the other hand, accepts that no one is ever ready and \" you go when you're ready enough .\" Total Good Cop, Bad Cop. \n Katniss Everdeen: Her mentors may interact less than Ender's do, but they fill similar roles. Her actual Capitol-appointed mentor Haymitch, in addition to having his abilities hindered by being a fall-down drunk, takes a tough-love, hands-off approach. He makes Katniss learn her own way, and only sends her help in the arena when she absolutely needs it. Her stylist, Cinna, on the other hand gives her confidence in the form of flaming dresses (yes, this works somehow) and tear-jerking send-off, \"if I could, I'd bet on you.\" (That's from the movie, in the book he says \"my money would be on you.\") \n Photo: Richard Foreman Jr./courtesy Summit Entertainment \n Excellent Ability to Choose Allies \n\n Unless you're Switzerland, forming alliances is fairly necessary for any entity in battle. Katniss and Ender may be living in fictional futures that are decades past knowledge of the Axis and Allied Powers, but they get this. \n Ender Wiggin: Throughout his time in Battle School Ender makes a few adversaries, but he also racks up a couple of close allies as well \u2013 most specifically, Petra (Hailee Steinfeld in the film version) \u2013 the only girl in her platoon but one who has \"more balls than anybody else.\" Before he's been able to earn the respect of many others in his school, it's Petra who helps him train for fight exercises and teaches him how to shoot. \n Katniss Everdeen: Although their allegiance waxes and wanes, Peeta has always been a crucial ally for Katniss. The boy who once gave her a loaf of bread when she was starving also helped her win the hearts of Panem by claiming they were star-crossed lovers. Since there (supposedly) can be only one survivor in the Games, Katniss often questions this alliance, but still uses the arrangement to her advantage on many occasions. In Catching Fire when she forms a rebel alliance of sorts with the other tributes during the Quarter Quell. \n Photo: Richard Foreman Jr./courtesy Summit Entertainment \n Knowing Their Enemy's Weaknesses \n\n In The Art of War , Sun Tzu postulated that it was just as important to know one's enemy as it was for them to know themselves. This tidbit was exceptionally true in the cases of Ender and Katniss \u2013 both of whom exploit their enemy's shortcomings to their own advantage. \n Ender Wiggin: Ender's fundamental strategy in battle is to observe, then react accordingly. \"Every time, I've won because I could understand the way my enemy thought,\" he says in Orson Scott Card's book. \"From what they did .\" His teacher Mazer Rackham later reinforces this by telling him \"there is no teacher but the enemy.\" Interestingly, this also teaches Ender to understand his enemy so completely that he learns to love them. Then, \"I destroy them,\" he says. \n Katniss Everdeen: In the Games, Katniss manages to out-smart the Career tributes who have trained their entire lives by simply figuring out that she can climb higher in trees than them and destroy their food supplies in one fell swoop. In Catching Fire , she's essential in figuring out the weaknesses of the arena itself. Outside of the Games, she is constantly calculating how much the Capitol needs her against how much they want her dead in order to determine exactly what she can get away with. And if President Snow and the leadership of Panem have one main weakness, it's not knowing Katniss' strengths as well as they know themselves. \n Photo: Richard Foreman Jr./courtesy Summit Entertainment \n Learning From the Wars of the Past \n\n Both Ender and Katniss are adept at learning from past battles to figure out how to win their current ones. In a way \u2013 even though they don\u2019t know it \u2013 they're evoking President Eisenhower's 1957 saying that \" plans are worthless, but planning is everything .\" They constantly must act, without a set strategy, quickly on their feet \u2013 but they're able to do it because they've been studying their whole lives. \n Ender Wiggin: Throughout his early training days, Ender learns from his mistakes and the mistakes of other kids in the Battle Room. By the time he's training to be a commander, he's learning from the alien race's own battle moves through videos of previous conflicts. At one point in Card's book, he sits down with Colonel Graff and Major Anderson, who ask why he's watching the old wars. \"To learn strategy, of course.\" They reply that the videos were propaganda and that the I.F.'s strategies have been edited out. \"I know,\" he responds. \n Katniss Everdeen: Like Ender, Katniss watches video feeds from previous Hunger Games, but she doesn't like it. Instead she learns one of her most important strategies from a battle that took place outside the arena. That little trick that she and Rue use in the arena to communicate via the mockingjays? That came from the lessons of the previous rebellion, during which the rebels fed false information to \"jabberjays\" \u2013 genetically engineered spy birds \u2013 that then reported those lies to the Capitol. The jabberjay strategy ended shortly thereafter and the birds were released and mated with mockingbirds in the wild, creating mockingjay \u2013 Katniss' spirit animal of sorts, which becomes a symbol of the rebellion and of Katniss herself. \n Natural Born Leadership -- And Humility \n\n Despite any differences they may have in combat, Ender and Katniss share a lot of commonalities when it comes to their leadership skills, particularly when it comes to one key trait: Humility. That's a characteristic that Bruns said is required of every good leader. \"I feel it's absolutely vital,\" he said. \"A leader needs to evaluate the situation and determine if the reward is worth the risk, and not put the blame on anyone else if their decision fails. They must also not gloat or excessively rejoice if their decision is successful.\" \n Ender Wiggin: When given control of his first platoon in the film Ender has just one question, \"Do you think they'll follow me?\" It takes a while, but they do. Because, like many before him, he's firm but fair and takes little credit for himself. Through every training exercise, every Battle School scrimmage, and every war simulation \u2013 Ender never overly celebrates his own (personal or team) victories. He merely analyzes any shortcomings in his performance, looses sleep, and moves on. He also leaves little room for his own feelings period. \"Mazer had told him there would be no pity, and his private unhappiness meant nothing to anyone,\" Card writes in the novel. \"He kept his mind on the game, trying to learn from the battles.\" \n Katniss Everdeen: Katniss Everdeen may be the greatest young revolutionary who never meant to start a revolution. She never really wanted to take on the Capitol \u2013 even though she hated it \u2013 or lead an uprising. But when she volunteered to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games and threw up the three-finger salute she meant to \"show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of us they can't own,\" according to Collin's first Hunger Games book. It worked, and soon everyone wanted to follow her lead.", "topics": [], "author": "Angela Watercutter", "wordCount": 2530}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "Here's How Memes Went Viral &mdash; In the 1800s", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/3346be92/sc/4/l/0L0Swired0N0Cwiredscience0C20A130C110Cdata0Emining0Eviral0Etexts0E180A0As0C/story01.htm", "text": "Thicker lines indicate more content-sharing between 19th century newspapers.

The shading indicates the number of publications in a region recorded by the 1840 census. Image: Ryan Cordell / Infectious texts project \n The tech may have been less sophisticated, but some barriers to virality were low in the 1800s. Before modern copyright laws there were no legal or even cultural barriers to borrowing content, Cordell says. Newspapers borrowed freely. Large papers often had an \u201cexchange editor\u201d whose job it was to read through other papers and clip out interesting pieces. \u201cThey were sort of like BuzzFeed employees,\u201d Cordell said. \n Clips got sorted into drawers according to length; when the paper needed, say, a 3-inch piece to fill a gap, they\u2019d pluck out a story of the appropriate length and publish it, often verbatim. \n Fast forward a century and a half and many of these newspapers have been scanned and digitized. Northeastern computer scientist David Smith developed an algorithm that mines this vast trove of text for reprinted items by hunting for clusters of five words that appear in the same sequence in multiple publications (Google uses a similar concept for its Ngram viewer ). \n The project is sponsored by the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks at Northeastern and the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities. Cordell says the main goal is to build a resource for other scholars, but he\u2019s already capitalizing on it for his own research, using modern mapping and network analysis tools to explore how things went viral back then. \n Counting page views from two centuries ago is anything but an exact science, but Cordell has used Census records to estimate how many people were living within a certain distance of where a particular piece was published and combined that with newspaper circulation data to estimate what fraction of the population would have seen it (a quarter to a third, for the most infectious texts, he says). \n He\u2019s also interested in mapping how the growth of the transcontinental railroad \u2014 and later the telegraph and wire services \u2014 changed the way information moved across the country. The animation below shows the spread of a single viral text, a poem by the Scottish poet Charles MacKay, overlaid on the developing railroad system. The one at the very bottom depicts how newspapers grew with the country from the colonial era to modern times, often expanding into a territory before the political boundaries had been drawn. \n \n Another approach takes advantage of the same type of network analysis tools social scientists use to map the flow of information in Twitter and other social media. Cordell has found that certain cities that don\u2019t get much attention from scholars were actually important hubs in the 19th century information economy. Nashville is one of them. \u201cIt makes sense if you think about it,\u201d Cordell said. \u201cIt was the center of the country at the time.\u201d \n Some of the texts that went viral in the 1800s aren\u2019t all that different from the things people post on Facebook today, Cordell says. Political rants were popular, for example, as were recipes and travel stories. \n Poems also turn up frequently, as well as another type of writing Cordell calls vignettes. These are sentimental stories that are presented as if they\u2019re real, but aren\u2019t attributable to an author and lack details that would make it possible to verify them. One example is a letter, supposedly tucked into a book by a dying woman and found by her husband after her death. She urges him to remember her fondly and live a good life after she\u2019s gone. \u201cThese are fascinating to me because they blur the line between fact and fiction, which sort of exemplifies the 19th century newspaper,\u201d Cordell said. \n The vignettes often had a moral to them. On popular variety, temperance stories, were aimed at getting drunks to sober up. Cordell likens these cautionary tales to the email you\u2019ve probably gotten from a concerned aunt or uncle that turns out to be based on a bogus urban legend when you look it up on Snopes. \n The media may have changed, but a century and a half later many of the messages are surprisingly familiar.", "topics": [], "author": "Greg Miller", "wordCount": 957}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.wired.com", "title": "Tick: A To-Do App That Trades Tedium for Pizzazz", "url": "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/3346be90/sc/15/l/0L0Swired0N0Cdesign0C20A130C110Ctick0Etodo0Eapp0C/story01.htm", "text": "Tick is a customizable, icon-based to-do list app filled with animations that appeals equally to logic and emotion.

If so, do you have a system in place to ensure it doesn\u2019t end up a failed mission like the epic weight loss campaign of 2011 or \u201cProject: Learn to Knit\u201d from 2007? There\u2019s no shortage of organizational tools to help in these quests. Omnifocus offers an OCD level of control, Clear\u2019s minimal, gesture-based UI tries to turn you into a productivity ninja, and Apple\u2019s Reminders app leverages geofencing to help you conquer goals. But for all the innovation in task management, these apps still treat users like soulless robots whose lives are centered around creating lists and checking boxes. Tick is trying to change that with a visually rich app that provides virtual pats on the back. \n With Tick you still create lists, populate them with tasks, and rearrange activities based on importance, but instead of representing each project with an antiseptic line of text, the app showcases them as bold blocks of color personalized with a cute, interactive icon. Users can color code each list, pick one of 64 icons to illustrate it, and when tasks are added or completed the images spring to life\u2014a credit card swipes itself on the edge of its box and snow falls softly on a mountain range. The animations are subtle, but you will want to create a project plan for laundry day just to see what the washing machine icon does. \n \n Tick\u2019s designer, Asem Hassan believes these design choices are what separate his app from other task trackers. \u201cWhere they provide a text to represent a list, we provide an icon. For every dull grey color they have, we have a bright color. For every gesture other apps have, we have a big shinny button.\u201d \n Bright colors and a flat UI make Tick feel native to iOS 7, but the app minimizes swipes and other advanced UI conventions in favor of easy to understand buttons. \u201cWe wanted to build an app that doesn\u2019t need a tutorial telling you how to do X or Y,\u201d says Hassan. Competitive apps promise to make task management easier by training users to rely on a complex collection of gestures, but Hassan disagrees with the premise. \u201cThey heavily tax the user experience in favor of being futuristic.\u201d Tick supports swipe and pinch gestures for power users, but as shortcuts, not core mechanics. \n  You still create lists and check off completed tasks, but the user interface is centered around colorful icons. Photo: Taphive \n Ultimately, Tick takes the position that task lists aren\u2019t that hard technically and the real challenge is changing behavior\u2014a task best handled by appealing to emotion through animated icons instead of teaching users to learn a sad form of sign language or arcane method of organization. \n Despite the differentiated approach, Tick\u2019s creators have a long list of \u201cto-dos\u201d they\u2019ll need to address to remain competitive. The app currently has no reminders or syncing capabilities\u2014things that even the most relaxed task tracker care about. Still, the Tick team isn\u2019t letting up on customization and hopes to include a bevy of fonts alongside performance upgrades in the next release.

Looking around, I thought it was funny that here we were, standing around the kitchen counter, and rather than speaking to one another, everyone was looking down at their phones, frantically texting and sending one another vanishing messages on the Poke app. \u201cSay cheese!\u201d I said, pulling out my camera. \u201cPretend you\u2019re all sexting!\u201d Everyone made funny faces, and I snapped a quick photo. \n I don\u2019t often post intimate family photos online, because I am a firm believer that you can (and should!) have meaningful relationships with people that you don\u2019t necessarily need to broadcast out to the world all the time. I never post anything online that I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable having reprinted on the front page of a newspaper. And this photo was the turducken of tech photos: Facebook family, using Facebook, on Facebook. \n So, I posted it to Facebook (under the friends-only privacy setting) and headed home to tuck my son into bed. I had no idea what was in store for me. \n I understood my privacy settings completely. This was about the gray areas of sharing, social conduct, and online etiquette. \n Someone had taken the family photo that I had posted on Facebook and posted it on Twitter. That meant that one of my Facebook friends had seen the photo pop up on Facebook, downloaded or taken a screenshot of the photo, saved it to his or her phone or computer, and then uploaded it to a totally different site. It was late at night; I fired off a response expressing my frustration. Then I went to bed. \n The next morning I woke up to what seemed like a national news scandal. I had dozens of text messages, several urgent missed calls, and thousands of tweets. Every news station (\u201cduring the slowest ever news cycle possible\u201d) I flipped past was showing my family photo and talking about my Twitter exchange. Obviously, people were greatly enjoying the Schadenfreude of a Zuckerberg getting mixed up in anything that had to do with Facebook and privacy. Gulp. \n The media world was abuzz over the headline \u201cZuckerberg\u2019s Sister Caught Out by Facebook\u2019s Privacy Settings,\u201d but it really wasn\u2019t about that at all. I understood my privacy settings completely. This was about the gray areas of sharing, social conduct, and online etiquette. (Ironically, the downloads of Facebook\u2019s Poke app rose in the Apple store during the next few days.) \n More important, the whole incident made me even more passionate about starting a discussion: Here I was, a living, breathing example of how tech could be a wonderful and amazing tool, but it could also get you into a lot of trouble. \n To understand how identity, humanity, and etiquette are so crucial to our modern lives and our relationships with tech moving forward, I think it\u2019s important to understand a bit about where we\u2019ve come from. \n\n \n\n\n \n Randi\u00a0Zuckerberg served as a marketing executive at Facebook for six years, where she struck groundbreaking deals with ABC\u00a0(for the first online-offline presidential debates) and CNN (to cover Obama\u2019s inauguration). She is now the CEO and founder of media and production company Zuckerberg Media, and Editor-in-Chief of\u00a0modern lifestyle online community Dot Complicated . Zuckerberg was ranked among the \u201c50 Digital Power Players\u201d by the\u00a0 Hollywood Reporter . \n \n\n \n From Science Fiction to Science Fact \n Technology and connectivity are becoming more advanced every day. What\u2019s the upside? We\u2019re more connected. And the downside? We\u2019re more connected. \n Once it was cool to have your own landline. Now five billion people around the world have their own mobile phones. \n Devices are faster, cheaper, and more powerful than anything we could have imagined even a few years ago. Moore\u2019s law has led to billions more people getting phones and hooking up to the internet, and why a phone today is now a hundred thousand times more powerful than the computer on the Apollo spacecraft that took men to the moon. \n Plus, people share more online every year. A few years ago, someone came up with the name for a technology trend designed after our own family: \u201c Zuck\u2019s law ,\u201d so-named for my dear brother, says that the amount of information we share in the world doubles every two years. Of course, there are limits to this trend. At some point, people simply can\u2019t handle any more information \u2014 there are only so many hilarious cat videos and cute baby pictures we can look at. But you get the idea. \n The scale of what\u2019s being shared is almost beyond our comprehension. Here\u2019s an incredible thought: there are more pieces of digital content in the world today than there are grains of sand on every beach on Earth (according to a Digital Universe report published in December 2012 by the analyst firm IDC). \n \u2018Zuck\u2019s law,\u2019 so-named for my dear brother, says that the amount of information the world shares doubles every two years. \n None of these trends is slowing down. \n Today, we expect to be online all the time, and we expect to be reachable everywhere. We usually are: over 90 percent of people keep their mobile phones within three feet of them, twenty-four hours a day (Morgan Stanley Internet Trends report). Fifty-three percent of people, according to a May 2012 Harris poll in the U.S., regularly check their phones in the middle of the night after they\u2019ve already gone to bed. And a surprising \u2014 and slightly disturbing \u2014 number of people check their phones while on the toilet. (I don\u2019t imagine most wash their handsets afterward. Think about that the next time someone hands you his or her phone and asks you to take a photo with it. You\u2019re welcome.) \n This online-all-the-time mentality pervades every area of our lives. Two 2012 surveys, one from Yahoo! and the other from Gazelle, and a 2012 TeleNav survey (that asked people which of life\u2019s \u201clittle pleasures\u201d they would rather do without for a week instead of parting with their phones) revealed the following eye-opening data: \n A surprising number of people check their phones while on the toilet. (I don\u2019t imagine most wash their handsets afterward. Think about that the next time someone asks you to take a photo with their phone. You\u2019re welcome.) \n 25 percent of women would give up sex for a year to keep their tablets. \n 15 percent of all survey respondents would give up their cars to keep their tablets. \n Nearly 15 percent of all survey respondents said they\u2019d rather give up sex entirely than go for even a weekend without their iPhones. \n 70 percent would give up alcohol. \n 21 percent would give up their shoes. \n 28 percent of Apple product users would go without seeing their significant others; 23 percent of Android users agreed. \n And a 2012 study from Harris Interactive revealed that 40 percent of people would rather go to jail for the evening than give up their social media accounts. \n So, this is the world we live in now. \n Technology is almost everywhere and has come to dominate our lives. So much so, in fact, that we\u2019re starting to see people yearning to be less connected and trying to implement rules, structure, and discipline in both their own and their families\u2019 lives, to ensure that all this connectivity does not come at the expense of relationships, skill development, and manners. \n It\u2019s going to become increasingly important to find that balance, because in the next decade we\u2019re going to see something even more extraordinary. Everyone and everything will be connected. There will be no division anymore between online and offline. One of the most popular Silicon Valley predictions is of a future with an \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d and we\u2019re well on the way to seeing that become a reality. \n The Screen-Balancing Act \n One afternoon I was working on my laptop while my son, Asher, was playing with his toys on the rug. He got bored after a while. I saw him staring up at a photo frame with my parents. \n What happens in a world where everything is screen time? \n \u201cWhat is it, love?\u201d I asked. \n Asher looked at me and then pointed at the frame. \u201cBooney?\u201d he asked. \n For a moment, I didn\u2019t realize what he was talking about. But then I got it. Asher had come to realize that content always flows from screens. On the big TV and iPad, he can get Barney and Friends. Surely a photo frame must also be able to conjure up his favorite television character. \n I laughed. But then I thought, He\u2019s absolutely right. Why shouldn\u2019t he be able to watch Barney on that photo frame? For that matter, why shouldn\u2019t any device be able to show us any information we want? Every piece of glass will be a screen, and every screen a portal to another world of information, content, ideas, and entertainment. There\u2019s absolutely no reason there can\u2019t be a purple dinosaur in every frame. \n As a new mom, that\u2019s both exciting and utterly terrifying. It\u2019s hard enough to balance screen time versus non-screen time as it is. So what happens in a world where everything is screen time? \n As we get more and more connected, it\u2019s also going to become increasingly important to know when to step away, when to focus on the people and places around us. A world where every object is a screen means a world of endless access to information, but it also means a world where we risk jeopardizing our relationships with loved ones if we don\u2019t look up from that screen from time to time. \n Just because we have a megaphone doesn\u2019t mean we need to shout from it all the time. \n I once overheard a major Hollywood film executive say, \u201cSocial media has ruined our ability to release bad movies. And we need to be able to release bad movies to stay in business.\u201d It used to be the case that a really bad movie could still have a great opening weekend, because it would take word of mouth a few days to spread. But in the age of Facebook and Twitter, a movie can be dead in the box office just hours after it opens. \n But just because we have a megaphone doesn\u2019t mean we need to shout from it all the time. If we\u2019re constantly crying \u201cWolf!\u201d nobody will take us seriously. As a society, we need to accept the gift we\u2019ve been given and realize that it comes with a set of responsibilities. When used thoughtfully and mindfully, we can expand access to knowledge and information, demolish old barriers to understanding, and give a global voice to those who were once voiceless. \n The famous science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke once said, \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d He was right. New technology is a kind of magic, and today we can do things with ease that were impossible just a few years ago. Like magic, each new innovation has advanced our society and our potential. Of course, the seductive glow of these magical devices can also blind us to some of their downsides and side effects. \n Once upon a time, all this was science fiction. Now it\u2019s science fact. \n Some Tips for Achieving Tech-Life Balance\u2026 \n Keep Things in Perspective \n I had no idea the internet could propel my single tweet so far. I didn\u2019t quite get it then, but I do now. \n Sometimes social media can ignite a firestorm, which has devastating, career-ending consequences. But most of the time, getting things wrong online merely results in temporary embarrassment and some hurt feelings. In the end, most things pass, and you have to keep them in perspective. If you\u2019re going through a flame war, stop, drop, and roll with the punches. In time, people will move on and you\u2019ll recover. \n It\u2019s Okay to Friend the Boss \n A Wharton School study , titled \u201cOMG, My Boss Just Friended Me,\u201d showed that people were anxious to friend their bosses because of the potential to suddenly eliminate what was previously thought of as a solid hierarchy of communication. Social networking can level this distinction with a simple friend request. What matters, then, is using the platform to your advantage. Add the boss, but make sure to utilize your privacy settings and only give access to things you want him or her to see. \n Protect Your Privacy \n Become a privacy-settings expert. It might seem tedious, but it will pay off. Of course, the controls are never foolproof. It may also be smart to practice posting abstinence. If you stand to lose a job or friends if certain aspects of your behavior were brought to light, then it\u2019s probably smart to stop either doing these things or posting about them, and be cautious of other people posting about them, too. \n When going out for a night with friends, it may be a good idea to assign a \u2018designated poster,\u2019 with whom you have to clear any online post before hitting \u2018share.\u2019 \n Digital Posts Can Have Real-Life Consequences \n A few years ago, I was going out in NYC with my girl crew when, like so many before us, we were rejected from a super-trendy bar with a famously strict door policy. Waving us to the side, the bouncer told my friends and me that we didn\u2019t fit the \u201cdress code.\u201d Annoyed at the bouncer, I pulled out my BlackBerry to vent my frustration on the then-new platform called Twitter. \u201cWorst bar ever = \u2026.. Worst bouncer ever = \u2026. It would be a huge bummer if their facebook pages \u2018accidentally\u2019 went down.\u201d I thought it sounded vaguely funny at the time, but I didn\u2019t invest a whole lot of thought into my message. \n When I woke up the next day, my inbox was filled with howls of outrage from commentators complaining about my threatened retaliation against the club. Ah, man. I had no idea the internet could propel my single tweet so far. Something I meant as a bad joke had taken on a life of its own. Of course, I didn\u2019t have the desire or power to delete anyone\u2019s profile, but as someone with a perceived influence at Facebook, that was an incredibly dumb and irresponsible thing to tweet. I didn\u2019t quite get it then, but I do now. \n When going out for a night with friends, it may be a good idea to assign, for the night, a \u201cdesignated poster,\u201d a friend with whom you have to clear any online post before hitting \u201cshare.\u201d If you\u2019ve had a couple of drinks and are about to go on a posting spree, this could help prevent you from making a potentially career-ending mistake. Better yet, just enjoy the moment and don\u2019t post at all until the following morning. \n *** \n \nThere isn\u2019t going to be a world where we can have our online cake and eat it too, where we can say anything we want online and expect it to have zero ramifications in the offline world. That wasn\u2019t true of the things we said before the internet, and it\u2019s certainly no more true now, when our passing thoughts and bad jokes have their own universally accessible archive. \n This may seem obvious, but it can\u2019t be said enough: always think before you tweet. \n Adapted and excerpted from\u00a0 Dot Complicated: Untangling Our Wired Lives by Randi Zuckerberg, published by HarperOne, an imprint of HarperCollins.

It gives us the sweet nectar that is stock Android but presents it to us in a generic body that doesn\u2019t feel special. The phone is excellent and can easily hold its own against Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S4, Apple\u2019s iPhones, and all of Nokia\u2019s Lumias, but there\u2019s little here that we haven\u2019t already seen in other high-end smartphones. If it weren\u2019t for the software, the Nexus 5 would be just another Android phone.\n Mundane hardware \n  IMAGE: Michael Homnick The Nexus 5. As someone who\u2019s toted an iPhone 5 around for the past year, I have to say that using the Nexus 5 was a breath of fresh air. The Nexus 5\u2019s 4.95-inch 1920-by-1080-pixel display looks crystal clear and puts the 4-inch display on the iPhone to shame. Text is clear, colors pop, and the screen is readable even in bright sunlight.\n \n There\u2019s one caveat, though: The screen isn\u2019t very bright. On anything other than the highest brightness settings, the Nexus 5\u2019s display looks dark and unimpressive. Though turning on auto-brightness will save some battery life, it\u2019ll also make the screen appear dull and ordinary. If you pick up a Nexus 5, I recommend cranking the screen brightness up to max and disabling the auto-brightness to get the most from the phone\u2019s high-resolution display.\n \n The rest of the phone\u2019s hardware isn\u2019t especially noteworthy. It feels solid enough to survive a few falls out of your pocket, but the design doesn\u2019t stand out compared to that of the\u00a0 HTC One or the iPhone. Even Nokia\u2019s colorful Lumias have more personality, as the Nexus 5\u2019s plain black (or white) color scheme makes it as faceless as countless other Android phones. In many ways, LG could have taken the chassis it used for the G2 , shaved off a few bits here and there, and carved \u201cNEXUS\u201d into the back to produce this model.\n  The Nexus 5 bears a strong resemblance to the LG G2. As one my colleagues noted when I was writing my first impressions of the device, the Nexus 5 is \u201cplastic, yet not unapologetically plastic like the iPhone 5c .\u201d Though the phone doesn\u2019t feel cheap, neither does it feel high-end. The ceramic volume and power buttons rattle when you shake the phone, and the giant \u201cNEXUS\u201d logo emblazoned on the back looks tacky. The Nexus 5 doesn\u2019t get greasy the way the iPhone 5c and the Samsung Galaxy S4 do, but the soft rubber-like finish does attract lint and crumbs, so you\u2019ll have to be careful where you set the phone down.\n \n You\u2019ll also need to be wary of the Nexus 5\u2019s protruding camera lens, which sticks out slightly from the rest of the phone and prevents it from laying completely flat. The lens cover is completely exposed and I worry that it\u2019ll be the first thing damaged should the phone decide to take a quick trip from your pocket to the sidewalk. Google sells bumper cases that help the lens sit more nearly flush with the rest of the phone, but this shortcoming could have been solved at the design stage.\n  IMAGE: Michael Homnick The camera on the Nexus 5's back prevents the phone from lying flat. The phone\u2019s slim profile does make it easier to pocket and hold in one hand, but I had trouble reaching the power button without adjusting my grip. If the power button were just a millimeter or two lower, I wouldn\u2019t have had to strain my hand every time I wanted to wake the phone or put it to sleep\u2014and I don\u2019t have small mitts.\n \n Using the Nexus 5 one-handed proved somewhat difficult, as I couldn\u2019t quickly reach the notification shade; and typing with one hand made the phone feel unbalanced. I faced a similar problem when I evaluated the Galaxy S4 for a hands-on review: The Galaxy S4\u2019s razor-thin bezels prevented me from getting a solid grip on the phone without inadvertently hitting the edges of the screen.\n Fast, with solid battery life \n  IMAGE: Michael Homnick  Although the Nexus 5\u2019s design is unassuming, the hardware inside the phone is on a par with what other flagship Android phones offer. The 2.26GHz Snapdragon 800 processor absolutely screams, and it handled everything I threw its way. It had no trouble pushing all those pixels on the big, beautiful display, even as I watched HD movies and played games like Dead Trigger 2 .\n \n Last year\u2019s Nexus 4 was a capable device, but it overheated if you so much as looked at it funny. On the Nexus 5, I played Dead Trigger 2 for more than an hour\u2014and watched the first half of Pacific Rim \u2014and the phone got only slightly warm. And most of that heat was from my holding onto it for so long.\n \n Like the cameras on the Nokia Lumia 1020 and 920 , the Nexus 5\u2019s 8-megapixel camera benefits from optical image stabilization (OIS). Even if you don\u2019t have shaky hands, OIS on the Nexus 5 lets you take better low-light photos, and videos that don\u2019t look as though you were rocking in a boat on the high seas when you snapped them.\n  Sample photo taken with the Nexus 5. Nexus phones aren\u2019t renowned for their photo-taking capabilities, but the Nexus 5 can produce very good-looking images. The quality is about equal to what we\u2019ve seen from the iPhone 5/5s; you\u2019ll still get better low-light performance from the HTC One or Nokia Lumia 1020. Photospheres make a return, but there\u2019s no slow-motion video recording as on the iPhone 5s, Galaxy S4, or HTC One.\n \n The Nexus 5 is sold unlocked, and it accepts any micro SIM you might have lying around, but I can confirm that it doesn\u2019t work on Verizon\u2019s network. I tried inserting first an activated and then an unactivated SIM into the phone and couldn\u2019t connect either time. Although the Nexus 5 will work on smaller GSM carriers, we recommend using T-Mobile or AT&T, both of which have nationwide coverage and fast LTE data speeds, with this model.\n \n We haven\u2019t put the Nexus 5 through a full round of battery life lab tests yet, but I got through roughly 7.5 hours of use on a single charge. During that time I had Wi-Fi enabled and the screen brightness set to max, and I played a lot of games. Your mileage will vary, but you should be able to get a full day\u2019s use out of the phone. The Nexus 5 doesn\u2019t come with a replaceable battery, so you\u2019ll have to use an external battery pack to\u00a0 extend its life further.\n It\u2019s all about the software \n  The new Android home screen. From a hardware perspective, buying the Nexus 5\u2019s hardware amounts to buying a repackaged LG G2 with a new camera and a smaller battery. What makes the Nexus 5\u2014and the Nexus line in general\u2014so noteworthy is its software: This is the first device to run\u00a0 Android 4.4 KitKat , the latest version of Google\u2019s mobile OS.\n \n Even if you\u2019re familiar with earlier versions of Android, KitKat will feel like a new world to you. KitKat is the reason to pick up a Nexus 5. It seems smoother than even Android 4.3 Jelly Bean , and\u00a0KitKat\u2019s aesthetic tweaks help make it feel modern and sleek. Google Search has been pushed to the forefront, and a new home screen is dedicated entirely to Google Now.\n \n If you were envious of the Touchless Controls on the Moto X , you\u2019ll be pleased to know that KitKat includes a similar feature that lets you dictate Google searches from the home screen by saying, \u201cOkay Google,\u201d followed by your query. It\u2019s not exactly the same, though, since the phone needs to be awake and on the home screen\u2014which means that it\u2019s not as useful when you\u2019re driving or when your hands are otherwise occupied.\n \n The feature does let you issue simple commands to your phone, so you can compose email and text messages, but you\u2019ll often have to touch the screen to finish the job\u2014and you still can\u2019t use it to toggle your Wi-Fi on or off.\n \n A number of changes in KitKat seem to be Google\u2019s unsubtle way of pushing people to adopt its ghost town of a social network. The most disconcerting of these changes involves the removal of the standard Messaging app in favor of Hangouts. Formerly Google Talk, the Hangouts app now does double duty as both your IM and your primary text-messaging client.\n  I don't know any of these people. (Click for full image.) Combining the two clients makes sense on paper, but the execution is a bit flawed. When you start typing someone\u2019s name to compose a new message, you\u2019ll be shown not only the contacts stored on your phone, but also people on Google+ who share the same name as the person you\u2019re trying to reach. Your contacts show up first in the listings, but the Google+ recommendations will confuse people who just want to send a text to their friend, only to be asked which of 500 people named Albert they want to contact.\n Bottom line \n The Nexus 5 is an attractive smartphone with an appealing price that will surely persuade many people to pick one up. Though the hardware is fairly mundane, the software will draw attention. Android 4.4 KitKat represents a significant evolution in Google\u2019s OS, and it sets the Nexus 5 apart from the rest of the Android pack. If you\u2019re on a GSM-based carrier such as AT&T or T-Mobile, you should seriously consider making the Nexus 5 your next phone.", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 1590}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Lenovo Miix 10 Review: A good tablet with an (optional) killer keyboard", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060784/lenovo-miix-10-review-a-good-tablet-with-an-optional-killer-keyboard.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "Lenovo is known for building notebooks with exquisite keyboards, but the company is also no stranger to the tablet game . It has also introduced pioneering convertibles, such as the\u00a0 Yoga 11s and the newer Flex 14 . The Miix 10 should be the culmination of that experience, but this hybrid falls short.\n \n \nThe Miix 10\u2019s specs are par for the course\u2014if you're playing last year's course. The 64GB of storage and 2GB of RAM are to be expected, but the Clover Trail-based Atom Z2760 at the heart of this device is a generation behind. Most of Lenovo\u2019s competitors have moved on to Bay Trail chips that deliver higher performance and longer battery life.\n \n \nDuring my testing, I encountered several frustrating slowdowns that didn't happen with the Bay Trail-based Asus Transformer Book T100, which uses a newer Atom Z3740 processor. And in our benchmark tests, the Miix 10 proved to be 10- to 20 percent slower than the Asus Transformer Book T100.\n \n  ROBERT CARDIN Lenovo's keyboard case is exquisite. Unfortunately, it adds $100 to an already high price tag. \nThe Miix 10 also delivered less battery life than the Asus hybrid: 8 hours and 22 minutes. While it sounds odd to call 8-plus hours \"short,\" the Bay Trail-equipped Asus delivered more than 11 hours of useful life.\n \n \nThe 1.28 pounds of curved edges and a flat back felt comfortable in my hands, but the 10-inch widescreen was a little too big for me to hold comfortably in just one hand even in portrait mode. Video resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels no longer sounds impressive, but I found it to more than adequate in my day-to-day usage, both on a desk and in my lap. The only time I noticed pixels was while reading in bed lying on my stomach, which put the screen about a foot away from my face. The bright display has excellent viewing angles, and it can be turned down enough for nighttime reading or movie watching without lighting up the whole room.\n \n  ROBERT CARDIN More than 8 hours of battery life is great, but some Bay Trail tablets are delivering more than 11 hours. \nThe Miix 10 has all the ports you\u2019d expect to find on a Windows tablet, including a Micro HDMI and a Micro SD slot (hidden beneath a plastic door) on the left side, and a headphone jack on the top right. There is also a Micro USB port, but it\u2019s in the center of the bottom edge, between the contacts for the keyboard dock. You can use it only if you're not docked to the keyboard, and you\u2019ll need the included adapter to plug in a full size USB device.\n \n \nLenovo\u2019s keyboards, on the other hand, are straight-up awesome, even the chiclet ones. The Miix 10's keyboard cover is no exception. Lenovo has managed to make a 10-inch keyboard feel just as comfortable as my full sized laptop keyboard. Key size, spacing, and travel are all superb.\n \n \nThe keyboard cover gives the tablet the feel of a high end notepad rather than a cheap netbook. It protects the back of the tablet in addition to covering the screen when closed. The tablet slots into a holder on the bottom and is held in by two clips on each top corner. I was worried that it would be hard to get the tablet out, but in practice it was very easy to go from desktop typing to couch surfing.\n \n  ROBERT CARDIN Touching the Windows logo on the Miix 10's bezel toggles between the Windows 8 Start screen and the current app. \nWhen opened, the tablet tilts forward and is held in place by a magnet behind the top row of keys. This proved to be surprisingly stable even when typing in my lap. This style does limit you to only one angle for the screen, but in all my location set ups, I found that one angle to work just fine.\n \n \nWith the keys all the way at the front edge of the cover, there is no room for a trackpad. You might think that you don\u2019t need one because you have a touchscreen, except every time I touched the screen to reposition the cursor in a wall of text, the onscreen keyboard pops up. And if you need to use an old desktop program that's not finger friendly, you'll want to plug in a mouse\u2014except the only USB port is now blocked by the keyboard.\n \n \nI'll admit a bit of bias as I'm such a fan of Lenovo's keyboards, but that\u2019s not enough to justify this price for a CPU that\u2019s a generation old. While not the best, performance and battery life are very good, so if your primary concern is a good typing experience, this machine might fit the bill.", "topics": [], "author": "Michelle Mastin @violajack", "wordCount": 793}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Transformer Book T100 review: This hybrid fills both its tablet and notebook roles well", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060781/transformer-book-t100-review-this-hybrid-fills-both-its-tablet-and-notebook-roles-well.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "Asus has been in the tablet and keyboard dock game for a while now. After several generations of Android based tablet and keyboard dock combinations, the T100 brings the sometimes schizophrenic interface of Windows 8 to its logical home on a hybrid tablet/notebook.\n \n \nThe tablet looks and feels like so many other slates. It's a 10-inch slab of screen with a few ports and buttons on its edges. The buttons are hidden behind the curve of the tablet so you can't see them when you look from the front. It makes for a clean look, but they can be tricky to find by feel. On the left side of the top edge, you'll find the lock button. Moving around the corner to the left edge there's a volume rocker and a start button. The Windows logo in the center of the bottom bezel does nothing.\n \n  ROBERT CARDIN Don't bother pressing the Windows logo on this tablet's bezel: It's non functional. \nThe ports and other slots all live on the right edge of the device: There\u2019s a Micro SD card slot at the top and Micro HDMI, Micro USB (for charging the tablet), and a headphone jack near the bottom. Two large slots on the bottom of the tablet line up with guide posts on the keyboard dock and the dock port itself. A button on the hinge of the dock releases the tablet when you don\u2019t need the keyboard. It also partially blocks the Windows logo, which explains why touching it doesn't deliver you to the Start screen.\n \n \nThe 10-inch screen runs a rather low 1366 by 768 pixels. Many higher-end and even mid-range tablets now come with 1080p screens. Despite the low pixel density, the only time I noticed pixels in regular use was when reading while lying on my stomach, putting the screen pretty close to my face. The screen was very clear on the desk or in my lap. The panel is bright and has excellent viewing angles. The brightness also turns down enough for reading comfortably at night without the need for sunglasses.\n \n  ROBERT CARDIN The Asus Transformer T100 is a tablet when you want one and a notebook when you need one. \nThe tablet feels solid despite its cheap-feeling glossy plastic back. The curved edges and back are very comfortable to hold in two hands, but the 10-inch widescreen is too wide in landscape mode and too tall in portrait mode for me to feel comfortable holding it in one hand for any length of time.Like most hybrids in this class, the Transformer T100 comes with 64GB of storage and 2GB of RAM (Asus also offers a 32GB model for $349). But Asus chose Intel\u2019s new quad-core Atom Z3740 processor (from the Bay Trail family), and I was impressed by the smooth responsiveness of the system. I felt no slowdowns or stutters in average use, including Netflix streaming and some light gaming. Benchmark tests confirm the improved performance, with the Transformer Book scoring 10 to 20 percent higher on most tests compared to tablets based on Intel\u2019s older Clover Trail CPUs.\n \n \nBattery life is also much better. The average 7 to 8-hour run time of the previous generation didn\u2019t need much improvement, but the Transformer Pad T100 lasted 11 hours and 9 minutes in our rundown test! On top of that, Bay Trail-based machines are also capable of running in connected standby, which means the machine draws almost no power while sleeping yet resumes to an up-to-date state (with email and other updates) almost instantly.\n \n  ROBERT CARDIN The hinge on the keyboard dock allows you to position the T100 to just the right angle. \nThat long battery life is all the more impressive considering that unlike Asus's Transformer line of Android tablets, the docking keyboard doesn\u2019t harbor a second battery. The extra weight would be a welcome addition, because the tablet-and-keyboard combo is fairly top heavy. I feared it would tip backwards while I was typing on my lap. The hinge rotates down as it's opened, giving the keyboard a nice tilt, but it wasn't enough to overcome the top heaviness.\n \n \nThe keyboard\u2019s keys are a little more stiff than I like, and their short vertical spacing made even my tiny hands feel a little cramped. It's still usable for long typing sessions, but it\u2019s just not as comfortable as some others I\u2019ve used.\n \n \nThe keyboard dock has a USB 3.0 port and a little touchpad on the keyboard dock, but it\u2019s barely worth the space it takes up. It frequently didn\u2019t pick up both my fingers for multitouch scrolling or other gestures, and I frequently found myself just reaching for the screen rather than fighting with the touchpad.\n \n \nThe Asus Transformer Pad T100 delivers on the hybrid promise of providing a good tablet experience and a solid notebook experience in one device, for a reasonable price. The keyboard is something of a compromise, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. And if you want to use this hybrid on a desktop, you can plug in a full-size keyboard and display.", "topics": [], "author": "Michelle Mastin @violajack", "wordCount": 841}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Microsoft offers industry templates, special pricing for Dynamics CRM", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060900/microsoft-offers-industry-templates-special-pricing-for-dynamics-crm.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "Microsoft is hoping to differentiate its Dynamics CRM (customer relationship management) software from the likes of Salesforce.com with a new set of 18 industry templates that fit the application to verticals including sports management, health care and more specialized areas such as prison inmate data. The announcement was made Tuesday during Microsoft's Convergence 2013 EMEA event in Barcelona. Microsoft also announced a pricing offer aimed at bundling Dynamics CRM with Office 365. Under the deal, both new and existing Office 365 customers can get up to 40 percent discounts off the list price of Dynamics CRM licenses. The offer is available though March 2014 in 42 markets, according to Microsoft. Also Tuesday, Microsoft confirmed that Dynamics AX 2012 R3, the next version of the ERP (enterprise resource planning) suite, will arrive in April. Customers and partners will also have the ability to run AX 2012 R3 on Windows Azure, Microsoft confirmed. However, this will amount to using Azure as a straight hosting service for AX 2012 R3. It won't be until the next major release of AX that Microsoft will have added features associated with pure SaaS (software as a service), such as multitenancy, which saves on system resources and allows many customers to be patched and updated at once. Early adopter programs for the latter are expected to begin sometime next year, and AX will remain available in on-premises form. Microsoft's timeline for cloud ERP \"has slipped,\" said analyst Frank Scavo, managing partner of IT consulting firm Strativa. \"It is significant because other providers like NetSuite and Plex do provide a fully functional ERP system in the cloud. Microsoft is still incrementally moving in that direction.\" But it's best to keep things in the proper perspective, Scavo added. \"On the one hand Microsoft's Dynamics' rollout to the cloud has been much slower than what I'd like to see,\" he said. \"On the other hand, [once finished] they will have by anyone's definition a full cloud service with full functionality for small and large enterprises. That will put them in a very select group [of vendors].\" Microsoft may have gotten a bit of competitive breathing room for AX on Azure from SAP, which recently announced it would \"refactor \" its Business ByDesign cloud ERP suite for its HANA in-memory database. While SAP is keeping a team in place to maintain the current version of ByDesign, the move to HANA will take some time and could push ByDesign off customers' short list until the work is complete.

The company launched Monday a preview of the import and export service that provides built-in support for BitLocker disk encryption, which enables users to encrypt data on the hard drives before they send it. The service provides an efficient solution for importing large amounts of on-premise data into Windows Azure Blobs or exporting Windows Azure Blobs, the company said in a post . Windows Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data that can be accessed via HTTP or HTTPS. Users don't have to worry if the disks are lost or stolen in transit because only users will have the key to the encrypted data, wrote Scott Guthrie, a Microsoft corporate vice president in the company's server and tools business, in a blog post . The company is shipping a drive preparation tool to make it easier to set up the encryption on the hard drives, he added. Once the hard drives reach a Windows Azure data center through FedEx, they will be uploaded to a storage account. Empty hard drives can also be sent to the center to export data. Import and export jobs can be set up and managed using the Windows Azure management portal or the REST interface. Offline import and export is faster, helps cut costs and reduces dependence on network bandwidth for massive amounts of data, Guthrie wrote. Microsoft's competitors like Google and Amazon Web Services already offer similar services. The service from Microsoft is currently offered at US$40 per storage device under a 50 percent discount during the preview period. The company does not charge a data transfer charge between the device and Azure storage within the same data center. The service, being previewed in the U.S., only supports 3.5-inch SATA II hard drives. Hard drives above 4TB are not supported during the preview, and no more than 10 drives can be processed per job, the company said. The import/export service only operates in a few regions of the U.S., so that customers with storage accounts in parts of the U.S., Europe or Asia have to ship their drives to supported data centers in the U.S., and the shipment must originate from within the U.S., according to Microsoft. Microsoft announced last week the general availability release of Windows Azure HDInsight, which it described as a fully compatible Hadoop service that allows users to provision and manage Hadoop clusters for big data processing in Windows Azure. This week, Windows Azure also introduced more features such as a Virtual Machine gallery that can be used to create new VMs in the cloud and the free use of Web Sockets with Windows Azure websites. It also introduced a new billing alert service that sends email alerts when the customer's bill crosses a certain predefined level.

People can choose help from others, instant or scheduled, on the new Helpout service based on their qualifications, availability, price, ratings and reviews. They can use a computer or a mobile device, provided they have a Google+ account, built-in or external webcam and microphone. Google has also launched an Android app for Helpouts. \"We want to use the convenience and efficiency of the web to enable everyone, no matter where they are or what time it is, to easily connect with someone who can help,\" Udi Manber, Google's vice president of engineering, said in a blog post late Monday. All payments for charged services are done through Google Wallet, which would require customers to set up an account before a paid Helpouts session. Google is offering a full money-back guarantee if the experience doesn't meet the user's expectations. Manber hopes that Helpouts will let people get and provide help in a variety of areas ranging from a computer glitch, a leaky pipe, to a homework problem. Helpouts charges providers a flat 20 percent transaction fee on all paid, non-health Helpouts, which Google says will meet credit card fees, the cost of offering the money-back guarantee, advertising and promotion, and the cost of running the Helpouts platform. The cost of the transaction fee is included in the amount paid by the customer. There is no transaction fee currently for providing free Helpouts. Starting Jan. 1, paid health Helpouts will be also charged a transaction fee. Providers set the pricing and have the option of pricing the service on a per minute or per Helpouts session, or give customers the payment option. Google said it is starting small with a few categories like art and music, computers and electronics, cooking, education and careers, fashion and beauty, fitness and nutrition, health and home, and garden. Providers are screened by Google. Healthcare service providers have to be licensed health professionals, and will be screened by HireRight, a Google contractor. Current providers on Helpouts include perfume and cosmetics company Sephora, Home Depot's handyman referral service Redbeacon and physical fitness firm Weight Watchers. Helpouts may not be suitable for every occasion and the number of people giving help on Helpouts and the type of help available will grow over time, Manber said. Users will have access to a variety of tools including the ability to take a photo during a Helpout, or to allow the provider access to the user computer remotely to help fix a problem, or to access Google Drive documents, photos, and presentations.

The attack involves \"miners,\" or people running computers that verify Bitcoin transactions, said Ittay Eyal, a post doctoral fellow at Cornell University's Department of Computer Science, who co-authored the study with Emin Gun Sire, a Cornell professor. Every 10 minutes, miners -- who usually collaborate in mining pools -- are rewarded with 25 bitcoins for lending their computing power to Bitcoin if they solve a cryptographic puzzle first. Miners process Bitcoin's transactions, which are recorded in its \"blockchain,\" or public ledger. It has long been known that if a mining group controlled more than 50 percent of Bitcoin's processing power, the network could be subject to a variety of attacks if the group wanted to act maliciously. But the researchers show that small miners may unwittingly join a malicious group. Miners are supposed to follow Bitcoin's software protocol. But Eyal and Sire found that Bitcoin could be significantly disrupted if a small group comprising less than 10 percent of Bitcoin's mining power decided to not follow it. A malicious mining group, or \"selfish miners\" as termed in the research paper, could \"fork\" the blockchain, or split it into a competing chain by only selectively revealing some of the transactions they've processed. If the malicious group's blockchain fork grows larger than the legitimate one, it would begin to collect a greater share of the 25-bitcoin rewards. Miners, seeing the malicious group gain higher revenue, would join the successful pool, even if it was unaware of its intentions. Eventually, the malicious group could control the transaction chain, Eyal said. \"The discovery here is a mining pool of any size can initiate this attack and are better off doing selfish mining,\" Eyal said in a phone interview. A variety of attacks are then possible, including spending the same bitcoin twice, which the network is currently designed to prevent. If a merchant received a payment in bitcoins, the miners could \"roll back\" the transaction to allow the bitcoins to be spent again, Eyal said. \"They could also prevent you from ever using your bitcoins\" by not allowing certain transactions into the blockchain, Eyal said. Fortunately, Bitcoin's protocol can be updated. Eyal said he and Sire have suggested a fix for Bitcoin's algorithm that would limit mining pools to no more than 25 percent of the total number of nodes on the network. Some mining pools today already exceed 25 percent, Eyal said. \"Obviously, we believe that these pools are honest and they don't have any incentive to break the protocol, but like I said before, technically they can and we believe this is not a healthy situation for bitcoin, which we believe is destined for great things,\" he said. Although Bitcoin is not controlled by an entity, a team of developers work on its core protocol. Updates to the protocol are periodically released and adopted by the community, although there is no way to force people to upgrade their software.

Even if your bookkeeping solution automatically imports transactions from bank or credit card accounts there\u2019s still the matter of categorizing them according to the job they\u2019re associated with or the employee responsible for an expense.\n \n American Express small business cardholders who use online or desktop versions of QuickBooks will soon have a better option. In the first quarter of 2014 the\u00a0app for iOS and Android will get an upgrade that lets you snap a photo of a receipt with your smartphone, tag it based on what kind of expense it is, the job it will be billed to, and the employee who made the purchase, syncing such categorizations and the image both to your American Express statement and directly into QuickBooks.\n Amex ReceiptMatch will soon let you tag receipts on the fly and sync them with both your American Express statement and Quickbooks. The benefits are twofold. Tagging can be done once, on the fly as expenses are actually made, reducing the chance that a receipt will be lost before someone can sit down and tag it in QuickBooks. And since digital copies of receipts are accepted by the IRS, uploading them to QuickBooks also lets you throw away your paper versions.\n \n The American Express ReceiptMatch app currently lets users upload photos of receipts to their credit card statement. Expanding this feature to QuickBooks stems from an exclusive partnership between Intuit and American Express OPEN, the company\u2019s small business division.\n \n According to American Express EVP Manish Gupta, since the recession the company has seen an increase in B2B spending.\n \n \u201cOver the last few years what we\u2019ve really seen is businesses start using our products for larger and larger spend to run their businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cWe started thinking through what else we can do to help them to solve any pain they have in their expense management.\u201d", "topics": [], "author": "Christina DesMarais @salubriousdish", "wordCount": 334}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Apple plans Arizona factory that will run on renewable energy", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060800/apple-plans-arizona-factory-that-will-run-on-renewable-energy.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "Apple plans to build a components plant in Mesa, Arizona, that will run entirely on renewable energy. It will be Apple's latest move to build up its manufacturing in the U.S. Most of the company's products are manufactured overseas, and Apple has been under pressure to make more investments at home. The project will create more than 2,000 jobs, Apple said in a brief statement to IDG News Service on Monday. It will work with Salt River Project, an electric utility in central Arizona, to create \"green energy sources\" to power the facility, Apple said. The project will create 700 jobs in the first year, in addition to about 1,300 construction and other jobs in Arizona, according to Governor Jan Brewer. \"Their investment in renewable energy will also be greening our power grid, and creating significant new solar and geothermal power sources for the state,\" Brewer said in a statement. GT Advanced Technologies, a crystal materials manufacturer, said it will own and operate furnaces and related equipment at the plant, where it will employ more than 700 people.

The supercomputer, called Catalyst, will be deployed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. Built by the U.S. Department of Energy, Cray and Intel, the supercomputer delivers a peak performance of 150 teraflops and will be available for use starting later this month. Catalyst has 281TB of total SSD storage and is a giant computing cluster broken into 324 computing units, called \"nodes\" by LLNL. Each computing unit has two 12-core Xeon E5-2695v2 processors, totaling 7,776 CPU cores for the supercomputer. Each node has 128GB of DRAM, while 304 nodes have 800GB of solid-state drive storage. Additionally, 12 nodes have 3.2TB of solid-state drive storage for use across computing units. The supercomputer is built around the Lustre file system, which helps break bottlenecks and improves internal throughput in distributed computing systems. The overall performance of the supercomputer is nowhere near that of the world's fastest supercomputer, Tianhe-2, which delivers a peak performance of 54.9 petaflops, but the implementation of solid-state drives as an alternative to both volatile DRAM and hard drives sets Catalyst apart. \"As processors get faster with every generation, the bottleneck gets more acute,\" said Mark Seager, chief technology officer for Technical Computing Group at Intel. The throughput in the supercomputer is 512GB per second, which is equal to that of Sequoia, the third-fastest supercomputer in the world, which is also at LLNL, Seager said. Sequoia delivers peak performance of 20 petaflops. Intel's 910 series SSDs with 800GB of storage are being used in Catalyst. The SSDs are plugged into PCI-Express 2.0 slots, the same used for graphics cards and other high-bandwidth peripherals. Faster solid-state drives are increasingly replacing hard drives in servers to improve data access rates. SSDs are also being used in some servers as cache, or short-term storage, where data is temporarily stored for quicker processing. For instance, Facebook replaced DRAM with flash memory in a prototype server called McDipper , and is also using SSDs for long-term cold storage. Though SSDs are more expensive than hard drives, observers say SSDs are poised for widespread enterprise adoption as they consume less energy and are becoming more reliable. SSDs are also smaller and can provide more storage in fewer servers. Samsung in August announced faster V-NAND flash storage chips that could be 10 times more durable than current flash storage. With faster SSD storage, Catalyst is adept at solving \"big data\" problems, such as in bioinformatics, analytics and natural language processing, LLNL said in a statement. LLNL has developed a system so memory arrays are mapped directly to DRAM and SSDs, which helps in faster processing of serial applications like gene sequencing. Seager said Catalyst is partly an experiment in new supercomputer designs as the nature of applications and hardware changes.

The outage began at about 12:40 p.m. EST. While application and enrollment tools weren't available for website users, other parts of the website worked, said Julie Bataille, director of the Office of Communications at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS]. \"This is frustrating,\" Bataille said during a press conference. \"We are on an aggressive path to make improvements, and we will do just that.\" HealthCare.gov, a way for uninsured U.S. residents to shop for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, has been plagued with problems since its launch Oct. 1. One of the centerpieces of the so-called Obamacare insurance reform legislation, the website has experienced sluggish page load times -- at some points pages taking eight seconds to load -- and in many cases, users haven't been able to complete insurance applications. The team working on fixing the malfunctioning website was able to bring the system back up quickly after seeing an overload of a small number of servers and a load balancing problem, said Andy Slavitt, group executive vice president at Optum, one of the contractors working to fix HealthCare.gov. The HealthCare.gov team was still investigating the exact cause of the outage as of 4 p.m. EST., he said. The website had significant traffic numbers Monday, he said. Website users should expect more service interruptions in the coming days as the HealthCare.gov team works to fix the site's continuing problems, Slavitt said. Officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have set a Nov. 30 deadline for having the site functioning for the majority of users. \"This is a natural part of the process, and [outages] are not unusual when enhancements of this scope are being made to the system,\" he said. Bataille said CMS was not considering a suggestion from some lawmakers and other critics to take down the site and fix it before relaunching. \"HealthCare.gov is fixable,\" she said. \"We continue to be on a path to make improvements week by week.\" Over the past weekend, the HealthCare.gov team made \"more than a dozen important fixes\" to the site, Bataille said. The team has improved an issue with inaccurate information being sent to insurance providers and the team has upgraded hardware to improve redundancy at the site, she said.

While Hadoop continues to grow in popularity, most reported use cases around the open-source data-processing platform revolve around ad targeting or some other specialized task. But at O'Reilly's Strata-Hadoop World, held last week in New York, a number of Internet services talked about how they use Hadoop to bring people together. Ancestry.com is using Hadoop as the cornerstone of a new service that allows users to submit a sample of their DNA and then have Ancestry.com look for matches to far-flung relatives, both alive and long-deceased. And social dating service eHarmony uses the service to refine its process of matching its millions of members. In both cases, Hadoop has excelled at comparing hundreds or even thousands of variables across millions of different entities, a job much too large for traditional relational databases or even data warehouses. \"Hadoop is one of those key tools that has allowed us to create a massively scalable system,\" said Ancestry.com Chief Technology Officer Scott Sorensen in one presentation. The service is moving from proprietary tools to Hadoop to parse its large and ever-growing amount of data, he said. Ancestry.com generates around US$480 million a year in revenue, from people who use the service to chart their ancestry, using their own documents as well as a repository of Ancestry.com's collection of 12 billion public records, about 10 petabytes' worth of data. Hadoop powers a new service offered by the company called AncestryDNA. A user can send in a saliva sample, along with US$99, and the company will take 700,000 snips of the DNA from the sample and load the results into Hadoop, which will compare the snips to more than 200,000 other samples collected by the company. The company can then provide a list of far-flung relatives, whose family connections can go back 10 generations or more. Half of a person's DNA comes from each biological parent. \"Small changes in that DNA over generations leave bread crumbs that are like a view into history,\" Sorensen said. Ancestry.com can use the snips to determine a user's mix of ethnicities, as well as match the user with distant relatives. Hadoop proved to be uniquely suited for this task in that it excels at taking 700,000 snips and then comparing those to snips from hundreds of thousands of other people's DNA to find matches. The service can find, on average, 40 fourth cousins for every customer who submits a sample. That result will only improve as more people submit their DNA, Sorensen said. The company used a number of algorithms developed in academia for finding hidden matches in DNA. But the engineers at Ancestry.com had to parallelize the algorithms to run them across a multinode Hadoop deployment. Using traditional scale-up architectures, it would take Ancestry.com up to four weeks to compare 120,000 sets of DNA. Also at the conference, Vaclav Petricek, director of machine learning at eHarmony, described how the online dating service uses Hadoop to make better matches among its customers. Like Ancestry.com's DNA service, the fundamental problem eHarmony tackles is a massively parallel one. The service wants to find a set of potential suitors for each member of the service, which involves doing many comparisons across a large number of factors, while slimming down the result sets to manageable proportions. \"We want to give people enough options to keep them engaged, but we don't want to overwhelm them,\" Petricek said. \"Because this is an embarrassingly parallel problem, you can run this on Hadoop in parallel.\" EHarmony customers fill out an extensive questionnaire, which helps to estimate the user's personality across 29 different dimensions. The system first uses algorithms to predict how happy two potential matches would be if they were married, using scientific studies that describe the personality traits of people in both happy and \"distressed\" marriages, Petricek said. If they have personality types that would indicate they would be happy in a marriage together, they are considered for pairing. This is only the first step, however. EHarmony must also predict how attracted two potential people would be to one another. \"There is no guarantee that people who have compatible personalities would be interested in each other,\" Petricek said. Gauging attractiveness between two people is where the use of big-data-styled machine learning comes in. The service keeps track of a wide range of additional variables of its members, from the types of devices used to interact with eHarmony to whether each individual is single or divorced. The company also keeps track of the flow of messages among its members, charting which exchanges led to successful matches and trying to find indicators among all the known variables as to why these matches were successful. For instance, one fairly predictable variable has been distance. The farther apart two people are geographically, the less likely they are to pick one another from a list of candidates. Another variable is the difference in heights between a potential heterosexual couple. On average, the two people are most likely to communicate if the male is 4 to 8 inches taller than the female. The company will not know which factors ahead of time will prove to be predictors of compatibility, so Hadoop churns through all the combinations of all the variables looking for clues. The use of Hadoop is improving the service eHarmony offers, Petricek said. According to a third-party study, the divorce rate among couples who met on eHarmony and married between 2005 and 2012 was about half the rate of those who met offline. The sample set is limited, Petricek said, but it still is a \"very encouraging\" sign for the use of big-data analysis.

Last week, the Washington Post reported that the National Security Agency\u00a0(NSA) has been spying on Google and Yahoo servers without telling the Internet giants. Schmidt expressed his disappointment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal .\n \n According to Schmidt, the newly-revealed snooping \"just doesn't pass the smell test.\"\n \n \"It's really outrageous that the National Security Agency was looking between the Google data centers, if that's true,\" said Schmidt. \"The steps that the organization was willing to do without good judgment, to pursue its mission and potentially violate people's privacy; it's not OK. It's just not okay...it's perfectly possible that there are more revelations to come.\"\n \n In Schmidt's view, the NSA has gone overboard. \"The NSA allegedly collected the phone records of 320 million people in order to identify roughly 300 people who might be a risk. It's just bad public policy\u2026and perhaps illegal.\" He admits that \"There clearly are cases where evil people exist, but you don't have to violate the privacy of every single citizen of America to find them.\"\n \n The government, not surprisingly, doesn't agree. In a statement that the NSA issued last week, the organization promised that it \"conducts all of its activities in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies\u2014and assertions to the contrary do a grave disservice to the nation, its allies and partners, and the men and women who make up the National Security Agency.\"\n \n Despite these claims, an audit released in August disclosed that the organization broke the law nearly 3,000 times in 2011 and 2012.\n \n Nevertheless , NSA Director General Keith Alexander has denied the allegations, initially made by whistleblower Edward Snowden. \"I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers.\" Last week's allegations did not claim that the NSA accessed the servers, but the links between the servers and the open Internet.\n \n Schmidt's objections aside, Google doesn't have a sterling reputation when it comes to privacy, either. Google knowingly took part in the NSA's PRISM program, which collected information on American's phone calls and email. The company has long hunted for keywords in Gmail subscribers' email to direct advertising their way. And last month, the search giant changed its terms of service to allow it to use your name and photo in advertising . One could reasonably describe Google's business model as giving you free services so they could learn more about you.\n \n Schmidt, and Google have good reason to be angry with NSA, even if their own hands aren't entirely clean in this matter.

The idea was to push the Netflix movies and TV shows at a bitrate that could deliver content at or near 1080p resolutions to take advantage of the latest HDTVs.\n \n \nIn January, however, TV manufacturers dumped their 3D TV experiment and began moving to what the industry called Ultra HD . That\u2019s generally considered to be video at a\u00a03840-by-2160 resolution (which defines video by the number of\u00a0 horizontal pixels, rather than the vertical pixels used by 1080p). Netflix appears to be preparing to shift to the next-gen technology, too, according to a GigaOm report .\n \n Eventually this screen could be filled with 4K offerings. \nIt\u2019s unclear how much bandwidth 4K will use.\u00a0Super HD requires bandwidth between 5 Mbps and 7 Mbps. By next year, however, development of\u00a0 a new video codec called HEVC or H.265 \u00a0should help immensely, as it reportedly halves the bitrate of H.264 video without a noticeable loss of image quality.\n \n \nThe clips that Netflix has put up for viewing aren\u2019t movies, per se, but just test clips showing off a number of scenes. Note that if Netflix doesn\u2019t think that your bandwidth connection will support it, you won\u2019t receive the clips in their 4K goodness; our rather pedestrian office connection at IDG\u2019s TechHive world headquarters generated video that was rather granular and ugly.

The USA Freedom Act, introduced last Tuesday by more than 85 U.S. lawmakers, would reduce NSA surveillance capabilities to the levels before the Sept. 11, 2011, terrorist attacks on the U.S., said Brad Wiegmann, deputy assistant attorney general of the National Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Wiegmann and other U.S. intelligence officials faced questions about alternatives to the controversial NSA phone records collection program during a hearing of the U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB). The USA Freedom Act, sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, would \"essentially shut down\" the phone records program, said Robert Litt, general counsel of the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The USA Freedom Act would require the NSA to show the records it seeks to collect are related to a foreign power, a suspected agent of a foreign power or a person in contact with a suspected agent. Among other changes, the bill would also require the NSA to get court orders to search U.S. residents' communications obtained without individualized warrants. The bill is \"flawed\" because it presumes intelligence officials often have specific targets when looking for terrorist activity, said Patrick Kelley, acting general counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \"That's the essence of terrorism prevention -- we don't know who we're after,\" he said.\"If we're limited to seeing numbers from a known [suspect], then we're not very effective.\" The model of targeting specific suspects when trying to prevent terrorism doesn't work well, Kelley added. \"We're connecting the dots here, so the fewer dots we that have, the fewer connections we'll make,\" he said. \"You are reducing the amount of data available and therefore making it much more difficult to make the connections that we need to make.\" PCLOB member Rachel Brand asked Litt if he would support a special advocate to argue for privacy issues at the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a proposal in the USA Freedom Act and advocated by several privacy advocates. Litt said he has concerns about the special advocate assigned to the FISC. He questioned how such an advocate would have legal standing before the court. The addition of a special advocate at the FISC would also mean some terrorism suspects have more legal representation than U.S. residents have when law enforcement agencies are seeking court-ordered warrants, he said. \"Are you going to set up a process that provides more protection for a terrorist than for Americans who are subject of criminal search warrants?\" he said. PCLOB members questioned the limits of the NSA's authority to collect telephone and other records. \"One question is, what's next? What could be next?\" said board member James Dempsey. \"What if the government decided it wanted to go back and start using [the Patriot Act to collect] Internet metadata?\" Dempsey asked if the NSA could use the same rationale it has used to collect telephone records to collect U.S. residents' Internet records. Section 215 of the Patriot Act allows the NSA to collect tangible business records, Litt said. \"It's not clear to me that the same legal authority could be used with respect to Internet service providers,\" he said. The NSA had to provide evidence to the FISC that the bulk collection of telephone records was relevant to its antiterrorism efforts, Litt added. \"We'd have to make that same showing to the court for another category of data,\" he said. The FISC also put significant limitations on the NSA's use of the telephone data, he added. Any other bulk records collection program would face the same scrutiny, he said. Intelligence officials told the board that NSA employees can only query the bulk telephone records for cases of counterterrorism, and those queries can only be more widely disseminated in a terrorism case. Board member Patricia Wald asked if the NSA's search capabilities were mainly limited \"to the technological capability of your search instruments,\" and not legal controls. \"Can that be further expanded if new technological tools would allow you greater search capacity in this or other bulk programs?\" she said. \"Could the haystack be made as big as the technology tools you have [allow]?\" The FISC has considered the NSA's technological capabilities, but the court has not given the agency automatic authority to move forward as technology advances, said the DOJ's Wiegmann. \"You have to look at all of the other factors the court considered,\" he said. \"How important is the information?

Starting today, all Android users can download the massively-multiplayer game from Google Play for free.\n \n Developed by a Google subsidiary called Niantic, Ingress is an augmented reality game set in an alternative version of the real world. Players take a side -- Enlightened or Resistance -- which battle against each other over \"Exotic Matter\" (or XM), which is seeded throughout actual locations around the world. Gameplay involves taking control of \"portals,\" which are typically placed in conjunction with the location of popular real-world landmarks such as sculptures, libraries, churches, and other heavily-trafficked buildings. The bigger the city, the more portals it tends to have, with densely populated areas the most portal-rich parts of the game map. Additional portals are added to the game as users -- now located in 200 countries -- continue to sign up.\n \n Naturally, the game mechanics involve significant complexity beyond this basic setup, but the key is that Ingress involves physically traveling in the real world to capture territories and collect virtual objects to score points and advance in the game.\n \n In closed beta for about a year, Ingress has already chalked up over 1 million downloads. The game will transition from the current open beta to its official public launch on December 14 as the story begins to heat up.\n \n In sync with its transition to open beta, Ingress is heating up its plotline by giving Enlightened and Resistance players a specific goal. (Enlightened players have to complete a certain project, Resistance players have to stop it.) It's the next big step along a long-arc narrative that will be reaching its climax, Google says, in about 24 months, when the story reaches its \"satisfying conclusion.\" A sequel or spin-off hasn't been ruled out.\n \n In conjunction with today's open beta launch, Google is also offering its top players over the next month a chance to win a trip to Google headquarters where they'll get a chance to collaborate on future developments in the Ingress storyline. Those hopeful for the win will also need to make their case via a \"creative\" social media post.\n \n Ingress is compatible with a wide range of Android devices running Android version 2.3 and up, with especially smooth performance on devices optimized for heavy graphics and complex gameplay, including Qualcomm Snapdragon -powered smartphones and tablets.", "topics": [], "author": "Charles Ripley", "wordCount": 399}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Twitter increases top end of IPO price to $25 a share", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060620/twitter-increases-top-end-of-ipo-price-to-25-a-share.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "Twitter on Monday increased the price of shares in its initial public offering to a range of US$23 to $25 per share and also revealed that IBM has claimed the company has infringed on several patents. Twitter plans to issue 70 million shares, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which would mean that Twitter could raise $1.75 billion if it sells its shares for the maximum $25 amount. Twitter previously estimated it would sell its shares for between $17 and $20 . Twitter on Monday also updated the risk factors disclosed to the SEC, expanding the intellectual property right threats the company faces, specifically highlighting a claim by IBM. \"From time to time we receive claims from third parties which allege that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights. In this regard, we recently received a letter from International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, alleging that we infringe on at least three U.S. patents held by IBM,\" said Twitter in the filing, adding that IBM has invited Twitter to negotiate a business resolution. According to IBM, Twitter infringes on a patent that describes a method of providing links to remotely located information in a network of connected computers, as well as a patent that provides a method for presenting advertising in an interactive service. The third patent describes the programmatic discovery of common contacts, according to the filing. \"Based upon our preliminary review of these patents, we believe we have meritorious defenses to IBM's allegations, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us,\" Twitter said. Twitter is currently involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, it said. In addition, because the company faces increasing competition and is gaining an increasingly high profile, it said it expects the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against it to grow.

CryptoLocker is a malicious program that falls into a category of malware called ransomware. Once installed on a computer, ransomware applications typically prevent victims from accessing their files or even their operating system until they pay money to the malware authors. Security researchers generally advise users against giving into this kind of extortion and in many cases there is a way to regain access to everything without paying up. However, CryptoLocker uses solid public-private key cryptography to encrypt files that match a long list of extensions, including documents, spreadsheets, images and even AutoCAD design files. According to researchers from antivirus firm Sophos, the malware's creators got the encryption process right and there's no method to get the decryption keys , which are unique for every computer and are stored on attackers' servers, without paying up. After it infects a computer, CryptoLocker displays a message informing victims that if they don't pay the equivalent of US$300 or \u20ac300 in Bitcoins, a virtual currency, or via MoneyPak, a type of prepaid card, within 72 hours, the unique decryption key for the files will be automatically destroyed. Users who regularly back up their data can clean their computers and restore the affected files from backups, but users who don't have backups should consider those files lost, the Sophos researchers said. Some files might be recoverable using the Shadow Copy technology , which is is an integral part of the System Restore feature in Windows. However, even users who have backups might realize that they're not enough to repair the damage done by the malware. Those backups might be too old or they might not include files from remote network shares that have also been encrypted by the malware. It seems that the creators of CryptoLocker considered that possibility and realized that some users might have initially removed the malware, but then, for whatever reason, changed their mind about paying up. As a result, they've recently started offering an online decryption service that allow such users to still recover their files, but at a much higher price. \"Apparently the crooks will now let you buy back your key even if you didn't follow their original instructions,\" Paul Ducklin, the head of technology for the Asia-Pacific region at Sophos, said Monday in a blog post . \"Word on the street, however, is that the crooks want five times as much as they were charging originally to decrypt your data after you change your mind.\" The cost of using the service is 10 Bitcoins -- around $2,300 at the current Bitcoin exchange rate -- and requires users to upload one of their encrypted files. The first 1024 bytes of the file will be used to search for the associated private key, a process that can take up to 24 hours. \"We're guessing that the delay is because the crooks have to run a brute force attack against themselves,\" Ducklin said. \"Without your public key to help them match up your keypair in their database, it sounds as though they have to try to decrypting your data with every stored private key until they hit one that produces a plausible result.\" However it's not immediately clear whether using this service is still possible after the initial 72-hour deadline given by the malware. If it is, then the cybercriminals lied and the private keys are not being destroyed after that time period. This decryption service might have also been created for users whose antivirus programs detected and deleted the malware after it encrypted the files, leaving them unable to buy the decryption key anymore. \"We're still saying, 'don't buy,' but we're feeling your pain enough to know how tempting it will be for some people to pay the crooks, even though the blackmail charges have now ballooned to more than $2,000,\" Ducklin said.", "topics": [], "author": "Lucian Constantin, IDG News Service", "wordCount": 658}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Wrangle your paper documents with a free MaxxDocs account", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060493/wrangle-your-paper-documents-with-a-free-maxxdocs-account.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "It's no secret that the paperless office we were promised at the start of the PC revolution has yet to actually materialize.

But with the updated platform, partners and customers will gain access to tooling that lets them build integrations themselves. This will be a big help to customers that use a great deal of esoteric applications specific to their businesses, McKinnon said. Okta will evaluate and approve each integration created by third parties, then continuously monitor them to be sure they work In addition, Okta has created what it calls the On-Premises Provisioning Agent. \"Before this, we had integration to Active Directory and LDAP,\" McKinnon said. \"But if you wanted to connect with say SAP or Oracle on-premises, we didn't have that capability.

It's HP's latest and perhaps biggest move to reduce its reliance on Intel's Itanium chip, which never gained wide adoption and appears to be nearing the end of its life . HP has already developed Xeon blades for its Integrity Superdome system , and it's now shifting its attention to Nonstop. \"We've committed to port the whole Nonstop environment -- applications, middleware and tools -- to x86,\" Randy Meyer, vice president and general manager for HP's Integrity server business, said in an interview last week. HP says the x86 version will be a \"parallel offering,\" not that it's walking away from Itanium. It recently started selling Nonstop customers the newest Itanium 9500 processors, known as Poulson, and will follow with the Kittson Itanium chips after that, Meyer said. But Intel said earlier this year it was scaling back its Kittson plans -- they'll no longer be made on a newer, 22-nanometer manufacturing process -- and neither Intel or HP has disclosed any subsequent chips on the Itanium roadmap. As with its Superdome system, HP's pitch to Nonstop customers is that they can stick with Itanium if they wish to, at least for the next several years, but if they want to transition to Intel's Xeon processors they can do that as well. When the port is complete, the Nonstop platform will use \"100 percent standard hardware components,\" including processors, storage and I/O, Meyer said. That will include replacing the proprietary ServerNet interconnect with InfiniBand. \"Infiniband is at 40 gigabytes today, 100 gigabytes is coming. ServerNet was not going to move up to that speed without some major investments,\" Meyer said. HP isn't saying when the port will be complete but Meyer said the work will take \"several years.\" HP has early versions of the Nonstop OS and SQL database running on Xeon in its labs, he said, but the project is still at an \"alpha, or pre-alpha stage.\" \"Is it anywhere near to a shipping product? No,\" he said. The Nonstop platform has been around for more than three decades. Its fault tolerance comes partly from its parallel architecture, where each instance of the OS resides on its own processor, so if one processor fails the system can keep operating continually. That basic design will be carried over to the x86 port, Meyer said. \"The architecture is timeless. It's not tied to any one chip technology or storage technology,\" he said. But it remains to be seen if HP can replicate the platform's reliability using standard hardware -- and whether customers will stick with it during the transition. Sales in HP's Business Critical Systems group have been declining. They fell 26 percent last quarter, partly because of the uncertainty around Itanium, and partly because cheaper x86 hardware is becoming more reliable and squeezing out higher-end systems. Meyer said customers should have confidence in HP's ability to port the platform because it's done the same thing before, including the shift from a MIPS design to Itanium. \"We're investing in this for the long haul,\" he said. It's not only HP that will have to port its software, however; numerous third-party vendors will have to recompile applications and tools for x86, as well as customers who want to carry over current applications. Mayer played down the challenge. \"The systems will be source code compatible,\" he said. \"As you move to x86 you'll compile it for that environment, so ISVs will have one source tree that they'll test in different environments.\" HP also announced Monday that it has started selling Intel's Poulson Itanium chips for its NB56000c and NB56000c-cg NonStop BladeSystems. Poulson is an eight-core chip, though HP is offering four-core variants because customers prefer to spread their workloads over a greater number of processors for reliability reasons, according to Meyer. It will offer the Poulson chips for its lower-end NS2100 and NS2200 Nonstop rack systems early next year, he said. HP says it will give customers more information about the x86 plans at its Discover conference in Barcelona next month.

With less turbulence and heat, you don't need as much power to run or cool the drive.\n \n The He6 also crams more platters into the same space.

Technology makers are always weighing tradeoffs between higher amounts of computing power versus the burdensome cooling systems required to stop PCs, gadgets, and servers from overheating.\n \n Liquid cooling systems and even mineral oil baths are just two of the cooling methods that have been explored in recent years to deal with this problem. HGST says that since the Ultrastar He6 is hermetically-sealed, using a process the company calls HelioSeal, these drives can withstand contact with liquid where traditional drives couldn't.\n \n Spill-resistant keyboards are great, but if HGST's sealed drives filter down to consumer devices it sounds like they could save you from data loss after an accidental coffee or soda spill on your laptop.\n \n Regular consumers may not be able to get their hands on a helium drive yet, but HGST has some major corporate and institutional clients lined up for the new drives. Netflix plans on using the drives for its Open Connect platform that places servers cached with Netflix content as close as possible to home connection such as ISP data centers. Huawei wants to create storage applications with He6 drives, and CERN, the Switzerland-based home to the world's largest particle accelerator, has high hopes for using the He6 s in its server infrastructure.\n \n Pricing and availablilty for the He6 was not announced.

Hohndel discussed a bugs fixing release at LinuxCon Europe in Edinburgh, U.K., last month. He asked Torvalds during a Q&A session whether he thought the focus of releases was too much on speed and adding new features, and maybe Linux developers should take a step back and have a release focused on bug-fixes and stability, as there was a mention that the latest stable kernel had over 4,000 known bugs. \"And the reason I mention '4.0' is that it would be a lovely time to do that,\" Torvalds wrote Sunday. \"Roughly a years heads-up that 'ok, after 3.19 (or whatever), we're doing a release with *just* fixes, and then that becomes 4.0'\" Torvalds was initially concerned that a bug-fixing and stability release alone would not be of interest to developers, who would do new features instead. Linux is developed by a community of developers and companies who voluntarily contribute changes to the kernel under the oversight of Torvalds. Torvalds has also proposed an easier numbering scheme for new releases with smaller and easy-to-remember point release numbers that would go up to the low teens. \"We're not there yet, but I would actually prefer to not go into the twenties, so I can see it happening in a year or so, and we'll have 4.0 follow 3.19 or something like that,\" he wrote. The Linux 3.12 kernel was released Sunday. Linux 3.12-rc7, which was expected to be the last release candidate for Linux 3.12, was released on Oct. 27 with the option of an rc8. Torvalds wrote that he had debated doing an rc8 but decided against it, as he is traveling with a bad Internet connection and did not want to delay 3.12 further. \"Sure, we had a number of driver reverts, and there was an annoying auto-NUMA [non-uniform memory access] memory corruption fix series, but none of it was really worth delaying 3.12 for,\" Torvalds wrote. Earlier this month, Torvalds said that Apple's decision to offer free its latest desktop operating system, OS X Mavericks, will not affect the Linux operating system at all, as it is not open source and needs expensive hardware.

Sure, you may be able to improve speed by adding RAM, upgrading the CPU, or replacing the hard drive with an SSD. But none of those solutions--all of which cost money--address the underlying problem. Your hardware isn't underpowered. It's overloaded.\n \n Cleaning out Windows will very likely speed up a PC. And no, I'm not suggesting reinstalling the operating system. There are less drastic fixes.\n \n [Email your tech questions to answer@pcworld.com .] \n Look for hog processes \n  Click for full size Your computer may be running a poorly-written process that's hogging a lot of resources. To find out, right-click the taskbar and select Start Task Manager. Click the Processes tab, then the CPU column header. The top items will be the ones hogging the CPU.\n \n If you see an obvious culprit, close the program that's running the process (it's pretty easy to figure out what it is). If that doesn't work, click the End Process button and confirm that you really want to kill this process.\n \n Should that fix the problem, avoid using that program in the future. Or find a better-written replacement.\n \n Otherwise, back on the Process tab, click the Memory column header and see if you can find the culprit there.\n Clean out autoloaders \n When Windows boots, it automatically loads additional programs--sometimes a lot of them. One big autoloader--or a lot of little ones--can slow the PC down.\n \n The trick is to bring up Windows' list of autoloaders, and by disabling and re-enabling them, and rebooting, figure out which ones are causing the problem.\n \n In Windows XP, Vista, or 7, click Start ( Start>Run in XP), type msconfig , and press ENTER . Once System Configuration comes up, click the Startup tab. You can disable items by unchecking them.\n  If you're using Windows 8, right-click the taskbar and select Start Task Manager. If you see a Startup tab, click it. If you don't, click More details, then Startup. To disable an item, right-click it and select Disable. \n   Check for malware \n I doubt an infection is causing your problem--successful malware doesn't draw attention to itself that way. But just to be on the safe side, scan for it, anyway.\n \n See When malware strikes: How to clean an infected PC for scanning advice.\n Do less multitasking \n The more programs you run, the slower they will all be. Consider changing your working habits to have less programs up at the same time.\n Turn off Aero \n  Windows 7 and Vista use a technology called Aero to improve the esthetic look of the screen. It's not necessary, and \u00a0it slows down the PC a bit.\n \n For more on Aero, and how to turn it off, see How important is Aero? \n \n Read the original forum discussion .", "topics": [], "author": "Lincoln Spector @lincolnspector", "wordCount": 481}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Surface Pro 2 firmware update packs a big battery boost", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060490/surface-pro-2-firmware-update-packs-a-big-battery-boost.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "A firmware update for Microsoft's Surface Pro 2 appears to have drastically improved battery life, addressing one of the beefy tablet's biggest weak points.\n \n Microsoft issued the firmware update shortly after the Surface Pro 2 launched. According to AnandTech , web browsing on Wi-Fi jumped to 8.33 hours, compared to 6.68 hours before the firmware update. Video playback also got a boost, from 6.65 hours to 7.73 hours.\n \n Another test by The Verge yielded 8 hours and 51 minutes of battery life when cycling through web pages and still images. That's a 20 percent improvement over the 7 hours and 33 minutes achieved in the site's previous testing.\n \n AnandTech says the update allows Surface Pro 2's Marvell Wi-Fi solution to reach lower power states than before. It's unclear why this functionality wasn't included at launch. In any case, the firmware update appears to validate Microsoft's claims of a 75 percent battery improvement over the original Surface Pro. The first-generation Pro lasted for about four or five hours on a charge, so a 75 percent improvement would put Surface Pro 2 battery life in the seven- to eight-hour range.\n   We're in the process of checking out the improved battery life using a real-life scenario, by keeping multiple browser tabs open, word processing, and using Twitter in Windows 8.1's Snap view. This type of use previously yielded a little under six hours on a charge at 50 percent brightness. While that's certainly enough for an evening on the couch or an afternoon working at a coffee shop, it's not quite the all-day battery life we were hoping for from the upgrade to Intel's \u201c Haswell \u201d processor.\n \n Surface Pro 2 users don't need to do anything to get the update, as it should have installed automatically by now. You can check which updates have been installed by opening the Settings charm and going to PC settings > Update and Recovery > Windows Update and clicking \u201cView your update history.\u201d", "topics": [], "author": "Jared Newman @onejarednewman", "wordCount": 323}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.pcworld.com", "title": "Heins out as BlackBerry CEO, as struggling phone maker takes $1 billion loan", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060580/blackberry-ditches-ceo-and-accepts-1b-loan-from-fairfax-others.html#tk.rss_all", "text": "BlackBerry will change its CEO and accept a US$1 billion loan from a consortium involving shareholder Fairfax Financial Holdings as it struggles with inventory and strategy problems. The company has abandoned plans to sell itself. CEO Thorsten Heins will resign when the deal is complete, with former Sybase CEO John S. Chen joining the company as chairman and interim CEO, BlackBerry announced Monday. The $1 billion loan takes the form of convertible debentures, exchangeable for shares at a price of $10, a 28.7 percent premium over Friday's closing price, the company said. Fairfax has agreed to acquire $250 million of the debentures, with other institutional investors agreeing to take the rest. If all the debentures were converted, they would amount to around 16 percent of outstanding shares, BlackBerry said. In addition, the investors could purchase another $250 million of debentures, potentially raising their combined stake to 19.2 percent. In September, Fairfax made a conditional offer of around $9 per share, valuing BlackBerry at around $4.7 billion, although it had not obtained financing for the deal at that time. The new arrangement puts a higher value on the company, but means Fairfax has to find less money to finance the deal. BlackBerry thanked Heins for establishing a more efficient cost structure and overseeing delivery and adoption of the BlackBerry 10 platform and BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) 10.

The modern world could suffer the same fate at a global scale. The inherent productivity of many lands has been dramatically\n      reduced as a result of soil erosion, accumulation of salinity, and nutrient depletion. In Africa, where much of the future\n      growth in agriculture must take place, erosion has reduced yields by 8% at continental scale ( 2 ), and nutrient depletion is widespread ( 3 ). Although improved technology\u2014including the unsustainably high use of fertilizers, irrigation, and plowing\u2014provides a false\n      sense of security, about 1% of global land area is degraded every year ( 4 ). As Fierer et al. show on page 621 of this issue, the diversity of soil biota in the prairie soils of the American Midwest has changed substantially\n      since cultivation ( 5 ). We have forgotten the lesson of the Dust Bowl: Even in advanced economies, human well-being depends on looking after the\n      soil ( 6 ). An intact, self-restoring soil ecosystem is essential, especially in times of climate stress.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      566-567\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1245861\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Plant Science \n     \n       Ume\u00e5 Plant Science Centre, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Ume\u00e5 90183, Sweden. \n       \n      E-mail: ove.nilsson{at}slu.se \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      568-569\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1245510\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Applied Physics \n     \n      \n      \n       Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK. \n       \n      \n      \n       E-mail: peter.leek{at}physics.ox.ac.uk \n      \n     \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      569-570\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246105\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physics \n     \n       Bj\u00f6rn Sothmann , \n       \n       Christian Flindt \n       D\u00e9partement de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, 24 quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Gen\u00e8ve 4, Switzerland. \n       \n      E-mail: bjorn.sothmann{at}unige.ch (B.S.)\n       \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      570-571\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246658\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physiology \n     \n       Guillaume Rey , \n       \n       Akhilesh B.

WALD/MARTINOS CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING, MASSACHUSETTS\n       GENERAL HOSPITAL \n      \n     \n     There are approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. Over the past decades, we have made enormous progress in understanding\n      their molecular, genetic, and structural makeup as well as their function. However, the real power of the central nervous\n      system lies in the smooth coordination of large numbers of neurons. Neurons are thus organized on many different scales, from\n      small microcircuits and assemblies all the way to regional brain networks. To interact effectively on all these levels, neurons,\n      nuclei, cortical columns, and larger areas need to be connected. The study of neuronal connectivity has expanded rapidly in\n      past years. Large research groups have recently joined forces and formed consortia to tackle the difficult problems of how\n      to experimentally investigate connections in the brain and how to analyze and make sense of the enormous amount of data that\n      arises in the process.\n     \n     This year's neuroscience special issue is devoted to general and also several more specific aspects of research on connectivity\n      in the brain. We invited researchers to review the most recent progress in their fields and to provide us with an outlook\n      on what the future may hold in store.\n     \n     To make sense of larger structures, we first have to understand the composition of their basic building blocks. Markov et al. (p. 578) describe how interareal connectivity at the single-cell level, revealed by quantitative anatomical tract tracing,\n      is relevant to our understanding of large-scale cortical networks and their hierarchical organization.\n     \n     A different but also rapidly growing research direction deals with the use of connectivity measures to link brain structure\n      and cognition. From the perspective of network theory, Park and Friston (p. 579) review our current understanding of structure-function\n      relationships in large-scale brain networks and their underlying mechanisms.\n     \n     One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the heavily connected brain has been the development of noninvasive brain-scanning\n      methods, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Turk-Browne (p. 580) provides an overview of recent exciting\n      developments in large-scale fMRI data analysis, with a focus on unbiased approaches for examining whole-brain functional connectivity\n      during cognitive tasks. Increased computational power now allows investigation of the whole-brain correlation matrix, the\n      temporal correlation of every voxel with every other voxel throughout the brain, and the application of multivariate pattern\n      analysis to these correlational data.\n     \n     A sophisticated system that depends on the astonishingly precise interaction of a large number of cortical areas is the human\n      ability to produce and understand language and music. Zatorre (p. 585) discusses how brain plasticity in the music and speech\n      domains can be affected by predisposing factors that relate to brain structure and function.\n      \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      580-584\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238409\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. \n       \n       \u21b5 * E-mail: ntb{at}princeton.edu \n      \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Noninvasive studies of human brain function hold great potential to unlock mysteries of the human mind. The complexity of\n      data generated by such studies, however, has prompted various simplifying assumptions during analysis. Although this has enabled\n      considerable progress, our current understanding is partly contingent upon these assumptions. An emerging approach embraces\n      the complexity, accounting for the fact that neural representations are widely distributed, neural processes involve interactions\n      between regions, interactions vary by cognitive state, and the space of interactions is massive.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability. Implications of this growing body of literature are discussed.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      592-598\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243283\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Jason S.

We sought to\n      engineer a viral antigen that provides greater protection than currently available vaccines and focused on antigenic site\n      \u00d8, a metastable site specific to the prefusion state of the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, as this site is targeted by extremely\n      potent RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Structure-based design yielded stabilized versions of RSV F that maintained antigenic\n      site \u00d8 when exposed to extremes of pH, osmolality, and temperature. Six RSV F crystal structures provided atomic-level data\n      on how introduced cysteine residues and filled hydrophobic cavities improved stability.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer.

The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

Shotgun metagenomic data suggested that these spatial patterns\n      were associated with strong shifts in carbon dynamics. We show that metagenomic approaches can be used to reconstruct below-ground\n      biogeochemical and diversity gradients in endangered ecosystems; such information could be used to improve restoration efforts,\n      given that even small changes in below-ground microbial diversity can have important impacts on ecosystem processes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 25 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 2 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      624-628\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243825\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yadong Sun 1 , * , \n       \n       Lei Li 2 , * , \n       \n       Alberto P.

Flg22 binding\n      induces FLS2 heteromerization with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1\u2013associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and their reciprocal activation\n      followed by plant immunity. Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22. Our data reveal the\n      molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-BAK1 complex recognition of flg22 and provide insight into the immune receptor complex\n      activation.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 26 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      628-632\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241097\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Creative Research Initiatives, Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Spemannstrasse 35, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author. E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 4674}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.sciencemag.org", "title": "[Perspective] A Pathway to Flowering\u2014Why Staying Cool Matters", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6158/566.abstract?rss=1", "text": "Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      566-567\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1245861\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Plant Science \n     \n       Ume\u00e5 Plant Science Centre, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Ume\u00e5 90183, Sweden. \n       \n      E-mail: ove.nilsson{at}slu.se \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      568-569\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1245510\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Applied Physics \n     \n      \n      \n       Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK. \n       \n      \n      \n       E-mail: peter.leek{at}physics.ox.ac.uk \n      \n     \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      569-570\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246105\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physics \n     \n       Bj\u00f6rn Sothmann , \n       \n       Christian Flindt \n       D\u00e9partement de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, 24 quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Gen\u00e8ve 4, Switzerland. \n       \n      E-mail: bjorn.sothmann{at}unige.ch (B.S.)\n       \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      570-571\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246658\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physiology \n     \n       Guillaume Rey , \n       \n       Akhilesh B.

WALD/MARTINOS CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING, MASSACHUSETTS\n       GENERAL HOSPITAL \n      \n     \n     There are approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. Over the past decades, we have made enormous progress in understanding\n      their molecular, genetic, and structural makeup as well as their function. However, the real power of the central nervous\n      system lies in the smooth coordination of large numbers of neurons. Neurons are thus organized on many different scales, from\n      small microcircuits and assemblies all the way to regional brain networks. To interact effectively on all these levels, neurons,\n      nuclei, cortical columns, and larger areas need to be connected. The study of neuronal connectivity has expanded rapidly in\n      past years. Large research groups have recently joined forces and formed consortia to tackle the difficult problems of how\n      to experimentally investigate connections in the brain and how to analyze and make sense of the enormous amount of data that\n      arises in the process.\n     \n     This year's neuroscience special issue is devoted to general and also several more specific aspects of research on connectivity\n      in the brain. We invited researchers to review the most recent progress in their fields and to provide us with an outlook\n      on what the future may hold in store.\n     \n     To make sense of larger structures, we first have to understand the composition of their basic building blocks. Markov et al. (p. 578) describe how interareal connectivity at the single-cell level, revealed by quantitative anatomical tract tracing,\n      is relevant to our understanding of large-scale cortical networks and their hierarchical organization.\n     \n     A different but also rapidly growing research direction deals with the use of connectivity measures to link brain structure\n      and cognition. From the perspective of network theory, Park and Friston (p. 579) review our current understanding of structure-function\n      relationships in large-scale brain networks and their underlying mechanisms.\n     \n     One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the heavily connected brain has been the development of noninvasive brain-scanning\n      methods, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Turk-Browne (p. 580) provides an overview of recent exciting\n      developments in large-scale fMRI data analysis, with a focus on unbiased approaches for examining whole-brain functional connectivity\n      during cognitive tasks. Increased computational power now allows investigation of the whole-brain correlation matrix, the\n      temporal correlation of every voxel with every other voxel throughout the brain, and the application of multivariate pattern\n      analysis to these correlational data.\n     \n     A sophisticated system that depends on the astonishingly precise interaction of a large number of cortical areas is the human\n      ability to produce and understand language and music. Zatorre (p. 585) discusses how brain plasticity in the music and speech\n      domains can be affected by predisposing factors that relate to brain structure and function.\n      \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      580-584\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238409\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. \n       \n       \u21b5 * E-mail: ntb{at}princeton.edu \n      \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Noninvasive studies of human brain function hold great potential to unlock mysteries of the human mind. The complexity of\n      data generated by such studies, however, has prompted various simplifying assumptions during analysis. Although this has enabled\n      considerable progress, our current understanding is partly contingent upon these assumptions. An emerging approach embraces\n      the complexity, accounting for the fact that neural representations are widely distributed, neural processes involve interactions\n      between regions, interactions vary by cognitive state, and the space of interactions is massive.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability. Implications of this growing body of literature are discussed.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      592-598\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243283\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Jason S.

We sought to\n      engineer a viral antigen that provides greater protection than currently available vaccines and focused on antigenic site\n      \u00d8, a metastable site specific to the prefusion state of the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, as this site is targeted by extremely\n      potent RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Structure-based design yielded stabilized versions of RSV F that maintained antigenic\n      site \u00d8 when exposed to extremes of pH, osmolality, and temperature. Six RSV F crystal structures provided atomic-level data\n      on how introduced cysteine residues and filled hydrophobic cavities improved stability.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer.

The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

Shotgun metagenomic data suggested that these spatial patterns\n      were associated with strong shifts in carbon dynamics. We show that metagenomic approaches can be used to reconstruct below-ground\n      biogeochemical and diversity gradients in endangered ecosystems; such information could be used to improve restoration efforts,\n      given that even small changes in below-ground microbial diversity can have important impacts on ecosystem processes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 25 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 2 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      624-628\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243825\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yadong Sun 1 , * , \n       \n       Lei Li 2 , * , \n       \n       Alberto P.

Flg22 binding\n      induces FLS2 heteromerization with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1\u2013associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and their reciprocal activation\n      followed by plant immunity. Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22. Our data reveal the\n      molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-BAK1 complex recognition of flg22 and provide insight into the immune receptor complex\n      activation.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 26 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      628-632\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241097\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Creative Research Initiatives, Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Spemannstrasse 35, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author. E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 4545}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.sciencemag.org", "title": "[Perspective] Storing Quantum Information in Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6158/568.abstract?rss=1", "text": "Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      568-569\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1245510\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Applied Physics \n     \n      \n      \n       Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK. \n       \n      \n      \n       E-mail: peter.leek{at}physics.ox.ac.uk \n      \n     \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      569-570\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246105\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physics \n     \n       Bj\u00f6rn Sothmann , \n       \n       Christian Flindt \n       D\u00e9partement de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, 24 quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Gen\u00e8ve 4, Switzerland. \n       \n      E-mail: bjorn.sothmann{at}unige.ch (B.S.)\n       \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      570-571\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246658\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physiology \n     \n       Guillaume Rey , \n       \n       Akhilesh B.

WALD/MARTINOS CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING, MASSACHUSETTS\n       GENERAL HOSPITAL \n      \n     \n     There are approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. Over the past decades, we have made enormous progress in understanding\n      their molecular, genetic, and structural makeup as well as their function. However, the real power of the central nervous\n      system lies in the smooth coordination of large numbers of neurons. Neurons are thus organized on many different scales, from\n      small microcircuits and assemblies all the way to regional brain networks. To interact effectively on all these levels, neurons,\n      nuclei, cortical columns, and larger areas need to be connected. The study of neuronal connectivity has expanded rapidly in\n      past years. Large research groups have recently joined forces and formed consortia to tackle the difficult problems of how\n      to experimentally investigate connections in the brain and how to analyze and make sense of the enormous amount of data that\n      arises in the process.\n     \n     This year's neuroscience special issue is devoted to general and also several more specific aspects of research on connectivity\n      in the brain. We invited researchers to review the most recent progress in their fields and to provide us with an outlook\n      on what the future may hold in store.\n     \n     To make sense of larger structures, we first have to understand the composition of their basic building blocks. Markov et al. (p. 578) describe how interareal connectivity at the single-cell level, revealed by quantitative anatomical tract tracing,\n      is relevant to our understanding of large-scale cortical networks and their hierarchical organization.\n     \n     A different but also rapidly growing research direction deals with the use of connectivity measures to link brain structure\n      and cognition. From the perspective of network theory, Park and Friston (p. 579) review our current understanding of structure-function\n      relationships in large-scale brain networks and their underlying mechanisms.\n     \n     One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the heavily connected brain has been the development of noninvasive brain-scanning\n      methods, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Turk-Browne (p. 580) provides an overview of recent exciting\n      developments in large-scale fMRI data analysis, with a focus on unbiased approaches for examining whole-brain functional connectivity\n      during cognitive tasks. Increased computational power now allows investigation of the whole-brain correlation matrix, the\n      temporal correlation of every voxel with every other voxel throughout the brain, and the application of multivariate pattern\n      analysis to these correlational data.\n     \n     A sophisticated system that depends on the astonishingly precise interaction of a large number of cortical areas is the human\n      ability to produce and understand language and music. Zatorre (p. 585) discusses how brain plasticity in the music and speech\n      domains can be affected by predisposing factors that relate to brain structure and function.\n      \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      580-584\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238409\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. \n       \n       \u21b5 * E-mail: ntb{at}princeton.edu \n      \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Noninvasive studies of human brain function hold great potential to unlock mysteries of the human mind. The complexity of\n      data generated by such studies, however, has prompted various simplifying assumptions during analysis. Although this has enabled\n      considerable progress, our current understanding is partly contingent upon these assumptions. An emerging approach embraces\n      the complexity, accounting for the fact that neural representations are widely distributed, neural processes involve interactions\n      between regions, interactions vary by cognitive state, and the space of interactions is massive. Because what you see depends\n      on how you look, such unbiased approaches provide the greatest flexibility for discovery.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      585-589\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238414\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, 3801 University Street, Montreal, QC H3A 2B4 Canada. \n       \n       \u21b5 * Corresponding author.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability. Implications of this growing body of literature are discussed.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      592-598\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243283\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Jason S.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer.

The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 4529}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.sciencemag.org", "title": "[Perspective] Quantized Electronic Heat Flow", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6158/569.abstract?rss=1", "text": "Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      569-570\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246105\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physics \n     \n       Bj\u00f6rn Sothmann , \n       \n       Christian Flindt \n       D\u00e9partement de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, 24 quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Gen\u00e8ve 4, Switzerland. \n       \n      E-mail: bjorn.sothmann{at}unige.ch (B.S.)\n       \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      570-571\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246658\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physiology \n     \n       Guillaume Rey , \n       \n       Akhilesh B.

WALD/MARTINOS CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING, MASSACHUSETTS\n       GENERAL HOSPITAL \n      \n     \n     There are approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. Over the past decades, we have made enormous progress in understanding\n      their molecular, genetic, and structural makeup as well as their function. However, the real power of the central nervous\n      system lies in the smooth coordination of large numbers of neurons. Neurons are thus organized on many different scales, from\n      small microcircuits and assemblies all the way to regional brain networks. To interact effectively on all these levels, neurons,\n      nuclei, cortical columns, and larger areas need to be connected. The study of neuronal connectivity has expanded rapidly in\n      past years. Large research groups have recently joined forces and formed consortia to tackle the difficult problems of how\n      to experimentally investigate connections in the brain and how to analyze and make sense of the enormous amount of data that\n      arises in the process.\n     \n     This year's neuroscience special issue is devoted to general and also several more specific aspects of research on connectivity\n      in the brain. We invited researchers to review the most recent progress in their fields and to provide us with an outlook\n      on what the future may hold in store.\n     \n     To make sense of larger structures, we first have to understand the composition of their basic building blocks. Markov et al. (p. 578) describe how interareal connectivity at the single-cell level, revealed by quantitative anatomical tract tracing,\n      is relevant to our understanding of large-scale cortical networks and their hierarchical organization.\n     \n     A different but also rapidly growing research direction deals with the use of connectivity measures to link brain structure\n      and cognition. From the perspective of network theory, Park and Friston (p. 579) review our current understanding of structure-function\n      relationships in large-scale brain networks and their underlying mechanisms.\n     \n     One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the heavily connected brain has been the development of noninvasive brain-scanning\n      methods, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Turk-Browne (p. 580) provides an overview of recent exciting\n      developments in large-scale fMRI data analysis, with a focus on unbiased approaches for examining whole-brain functional connectivity\n      during cognitive tasks. Increased computational power now allows investigation of the whole-brain correlation matrix, the\n      temporal correlation of every voxel with every other voxel throughout the brain, and the application of multivariate pattern\n      analysis to these correlational data.\n     \n     A sophisticated system that depends on the astonishingly precise interaction of a large number of cortical areas is the human\n      ability to produce and understand language and music. Zatorre (p. 585) discusses how brain plasticity in the music and speech\n      domains can be affected by predisposing factors that relate to brain structure and function.\n      \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      580-584\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238409\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. \n       \n       \u21b5 * E-mail: ntb{at}princeton.edu \n      \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Noninvasive studies of human brain function hold great potential to unlock mysteries of the human mind. The complexity of\n      data generated by such studies, however, has prompted various simplifying assumptions during analysis. Although this has enabled\n      considerable progress, our current understanding is partly contingent upon these assumptions. An emerging approach embraces\n      the complexity, accounting for the fact that neural representations are widely distributed, neural processes involve interactions\n      between regions, interactions vary by cognitive state, and the space of interactions is massive. Because what you see depends\n      on how you look, such unbiased approaches provide the greatest flexibility for discovery.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      585-589\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238414\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, 3801 University Street, Montreal, QC H3A 2B4 Canada. \n       \n       \u21b5 * Corresponding author.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability. Implications of this growing body of literature are discussed.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      592-598\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243283\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Jason S.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 4501}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.sciencemag.org", "title": "[Perspective] Rhythmic Respiration", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6158/570.abstract?rss=1", "text": "Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      570-571\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1246658\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Physiology \n     \n       Guillaume Rey , \n       \n       Akhilesh B.

WALD/MARTINOS CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING, MASSACHUSETTS\n       GENERAL HOSPITAL \n      \n     \n     There are approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. Over the past decades, we have made enormous progress in understanding\n      their molecular, genetic, and structural makeup as well as their function. However, the real power of the central nervous\n      system lies in the smooth coordination of large numbers of neurons. Neurons are thus organized on many different scales, from\n      small microcircuits and assemblies all the way to regional brain networks. To interact effectively on all these levels, neurons,\n      nuclei, cortical columns, and larger areas need to be connected. The study of neuronal connectivity has expanded rapidly in\n      past years. Large research groups have recently joined forces and formed consortia to tackle the difficult problems of how\n      to experimentally investigate connections in the brain and how to analyze and make sense of the enormous amount of data that\n      arises in the process.\n     \n     This year's neuroscience special issue is devoted to general and also several more specific aspects of research on connectivity\n      in the brain. We invited researchers to review the most recent progress in their fields and to provide us with an outlook\n      on what the future may hold in store.\n     \n     To make sense of larger structures, we first have to understand the composition of their basic building blocks. Markov et al. (p. 578) describe how interareal connectivity at the single-cell level, revealed by quantitative anatomical tract tracing,\n      is relevant to our understanding of large-scale cortical networks and their hierarchical organization.\n     \n     A different but also rapidly growing research direction deals with the use of connectivity measures to link brain structure\n      and cognition. From the perspective of network theory, Park and Friston (p. 579) review our current understanding of structure-function\n      relationships in large-scale brain networks and their underlying mechanisms.\n     \n     One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the heavily connected brain has been the development of noninvasive brain-scanning\n      methods, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Turk-Browne (p. 580) provides an overview of recent exciting\n      developments in large-scale fMRI data analysis, with a focus on unbiased approaches for examining whole-brain functional connectivity\n      during cognitive tasks. Increased computational power now allows investigation of the whole-brain correlation matrix, the\n      temporal correlation of every voxel with every other voxel throughout the brain, and the application of multivariate pattern\n      analysis to these correlational data.\n     \n     A sophisticated system that depends on the astonishingly precise interaction of a large number of cortical areas is the human\n      ability to produce and understand language and music. Zatorre (p. 585) discusses how brain plasticity in the music and speech\n      domains can be affected by predisposing factors that relate to brain structure and function.\n      \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      580-584\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238409\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. \n       \n       \u21b5 * E-mail: ntb{at}princeton.edu \n      \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Noninvasive studies of human brain function hold great potential to unlock mysteries of the human mind. The complexity of\n      data generated by such studies, however, has prompted various simplifying assumptions during analysis. Although this has enabled\n      considerable progress, our current understanding is partly contingent upon these assumptions. An emerging approach embraces\n      the complexity, accounting for the fact that neural representations are widely distributed, neural processes involve interactions\n      between regions, interactions vary by cognitive state, and the space of interactions is massive.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability. Implications of this growing body of literature are discussed.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      592-598\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243283\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Jason S.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer. We report on the quantitative measurement of\n      the quantum-limited heat flow for Fermi particles across a single electronic channel, using noise thermometry. The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

WALD/MARTINOS CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING, MASSACHUSETTS\n       GENERAL HOSPITAL \n      \n     \n     There are approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. Over the past decades, we have made enormous progress in understanding\n      their molecular, genetic, and structural makeup as well as their function. However, the real power of the central nervous\n      system lies in the smooth coordination of large numbers of neurons. Neurons are thus organized on many different scales, from\n      small microcircuits and assemblies all the way to regional brain networks. To interact effectively on all these levels, neurons,\n      nuclei, cortical columns, and larger areas need to be connected. The study of neuronal connectivity has expanded rapidly in\n      past years. Large research groups have recently joined forces and formed consortia to tackle the difficult problems of how\n      to experimentally investigate connections in the brain and how to analyze and make sense of the enormous amount of data that\n      arises in the process.\n     \n     This year's neuroscience special issue is devoted to general and also several more specific aspects of research on connectivity\n      in the brain. We invited researchers to review the most recent progress in their fields and to provide us with an outlook\n      on what the future may hold in store.\n     \n     To make sense of larger structures, we first have to understand the composition of their basic building blocks. Markov et al. (p. 578) describe how interareal connectivity at the single-cell level, revealed by quantitative anatomical tract tracing,\n      is relevant to our understanding of large-scale cortical networks and their hierarchical organization.\n     \n     A different but also rapidly growing research direction deals with the use of connectivity measures to link brain structure\n      and cognition. From the perspective of network theory, Park and Friston (p. 579) review our current understanding of structure-function\n      relationships in large-scale brain networks and their underlying mechanisms.\n     \n     One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the heavily connected brain has been the development of noninvasive brain-scanning\n      methods, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Turk-Browne (p. 580) provides an overview of recent exciting\n      developments in large-scale fMRI data analysis, with a focus on unbiased approaches for examining whole-brain functional connectivity\n      during cognitive tasks. Increased computational power now allows investigation of the whole-brain correlation matrix, the\n      temporal correlation of every voxel with every other voxel throughout the brain, and the application of multivariate pattern\n      analysis to these correlational data.\n     \n     A sophisticated system that depends on the astonishingly precise interaction of a large number of cortical areas is the human\n      ability to produce and understand language and music. Zatorre (p. 585) discusses how brain plasticity in the music and speech\n      domains can be affected by predisposing factors that relate to brain structure and function.\n      \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      580-584\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238409\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, 08540, USA. \n       \n       \u21b5 * E-mail: ntb{at}princeton.edu \n      \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Noninvasive studies of human brain function hold great potential to unlock mysteries of the human mind. The complexity of\n      data generated by such studies, however, has prompted various simplifying assumptions during analysis. Although this has enabled\n      considerable progress, our current understanding is partly contingent upon these assumptions. An emerging approach embraces\n      the complexity, accounting for the fact that neural representations are widely distributed, neural processes involve interactions\n      between regions, interactions vary by cognitive state, and the space of interactions is massive.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability.

We sought to\n      engineer a viral antigen that provides greater protection than currently available vaccines and focused on antigenic site\n      \u00d8, a metastable site specific to the prefusion state of the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, as this site is targeted by extremely\n      potent RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Structure-based design yielded stabilized versions of RSV F that maintained antigenic\n      site \u00d8 when exposed to extremes of pH, osmolality, and temperature. Six RSV F crystal structures provided atomic-level data\n      on how introduced cysteine residues and filled hydrophobic cavities improved stability. Immunization with site \u00d8\u2013stabilized\n      variants of RSV F in mice and macaques elicited levels of RSV-specific neutralizing activity many times the protective threshold.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 25 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      598-601\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243254\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie, Auf dem H\u00fcgel 69, 53121 Bonn, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 * Corresponding author.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer. We report on the quantitative measurement of\n      the quantum-limited heat flow for Fermi particles across a single electronic channel, using noise thermometry. The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

Shotgun metagenomic data suggested that these spatial patterns\n      were associated with strong shifts in carbon dynamics. We show that metagenomic approaches can be used to reconstruct below-ground\n      biogeochemical and diversity gradients in endangered ecosystems; such information could be used to improve restoration efforts,\n      given that even small changes in below-ground microbial diversity can have important impacts on ecosystem processes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 25 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 2 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      624-628\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243825\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yadong Sun 1 , * , \n       \n       Lei Li 2 , * , \n       \n       Alberto P.

A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability. Implications of this growing body of literature are discussed.\n      \n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      592-598\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243283\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Jason S.

We sought to\n      engineer a viral antigen that provides greater protection than currently available vaccines and focused on antigenic site\n      \u00d8, a metastable site specific to the prefusion state of the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, as this site is targeted by extremely\n      potent RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Structure-based design yielded stabilized versions of RSV F that maintained antigenic\n      site \u00d8 when exposed to extremes of pH, osmolality, and temperature. Six RSV F crystal structures provided atomic-level data\n      on how introduced cysteine residues and filled hydrophobic cavities improved stability. Immunization with site \u00d8\u2013stabilized\n      variants of RSV F in mice and macaques elicited levels of RSV-specific neutralizing activity many times the protective threshold.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 25 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      598-601\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243254\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie, Auf dem H\u00fcgel 69, 53121 Bonn, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 * Corresponding author.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer. We report on the quantitative measurement of\n      the quantum-limited heat flow for Fermi particles across a single electronic channel, using noise thermometry. The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

Shotgun metagenomic data suggested that these spatial patterns\n      were associated with strong shifts in carbon dynamics. We show that metagenomic approaches can be used to reconstruct below-ground\n      biogeochemical and diversity gradients in endangered ecosystems; such information could be used to improve restoration efforts,\n      given that even small changes in below-ground microbial diversity can have important impacts on ecosystem processes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 25 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 2 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      624-628\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243825\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yadong Sun 1 , * , \n       \n       Lei Li 2 , * , \n       \n       Alberto P.

Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22. Our data reveal the\n      molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-BAK1 complex recognition of flg22 and provide insight into the immune receptor complex\n      activation.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 26 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      628-632\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241097\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Creative Research Initiatives, Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Spemannstrasse 35, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author. E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused\n      on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual\n      differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these\n      domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also\n      point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity\n      to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain\n      activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies\n      have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive\n      of new sensory-motor learning ability.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer. We report on the quantitative measurement of\n      the quantum-limited heat flow for Fermi particles across a single electronic channel, using noise thermometry. The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport. The achieved accuracy of below 10% opens\n      access to many experiments involving the quantum manipulation of heat.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 13 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 16 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      604-607\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1238723\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n        1 Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.\n       \n       \n        2 Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08854, USA.\n       \n       \n        3 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 * Corresponding author.

A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

Flg22 binding\n      induces FLS2 heteromerization with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1\u2013associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and their reciprocal activation\n      followed by plant immunity. Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22. Our data reveal the\n      molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-BAK1 complex recognition of flg22 and provide insight into the immune receptor complex\n      activation.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 26 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      628-632\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241097\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Creative Research Initiatives, Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Spemannstrasse 35, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author. E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

However, during the past 22 years, the radio pulse profile of the Crab\n      pulsar has shown a steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse components at 0.62\u00b0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0 per century. There are also secular changes in the relative strengths of several components of the profile. The changing\n      component separation indicates that the axis of the dipolar magnetic field, embedded in the neutron star, is moving toward\n      the stellar equator. This evolution of the magnetic field could explain why the pulsar does not spin down as expected from\n      simple braking by a rotating dipolar magnetic field.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 15 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      601-604\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241912\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       S.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer.

The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

Such universality, combined with the relationship\n      between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer. We report on the quantitative measurement of\n      the quantum-limited heat flow for Fermi particles across a single electronic channel, using noise thermometry. The demonstrated\n      agreement with the predicted G Q establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Intermolecular coordination between\n      the dehydrogenated 8-hq and Cu adatoms was also revealed by the submolecular resolution AFM characterization.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion)\n      and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables\n      to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression\n      appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying\n      effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 4 April 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 24 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      607-610\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243289\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Brian Vlastakis 1 , * , \n       \n       Gerhard Kirchmair 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zaki Leghtas 1 , 2 , \n       \n       Simon E.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

The atomically resolved molecular structures enable\n      a precise determination of the characteristics of hydrogen bonding networks, including the bonding sites, orientations, and\n      lengths. The observation of bond contrast was interpreted by ab initio density functional calculations, which indicated the\n      electron density contribution from the hybridized electronic state of the hydrogen bond. Intermolecular coordination between\n      the dehydrogenated 8-hq and Cu adatoms was also revealed by the submolecular resolution AFM characterization. The direct identification\n      of local bonding configurations by NC-AFM would facilitate detailed investigations of intermolecular interactions in complex\n      molecules with multiple active sites.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 1 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 9 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      614-617\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1244358\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       L.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon\n      qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much\n      greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons.\n      With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states,\n      known as a \u201ccat state.\u201d We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions\n      of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum\n      computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 16 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 18 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      611-614\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242603\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Jun Zhang 1 , * , \n       \n       Pengcheng Chen 1 , * , \n       \n       Bingkai Yuan 1 , \n       \n       Wei Ji 2 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Zhihai Cheng 1 , \u2020 , \n       \n       Xiaohui Qiu 1 , \u2020 \n      \n      \n        1 Key Laboratory of Standardization and Measurement for Nanotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Center for Nanoscience\n        and Technology, Beijing 100190, China.\n       \n       \n        2 Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.\n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small,\n      the concomitant changes in OHC are large.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 21 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      621-624\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243768\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Noah Fierer 1 , 2 , * , \n       \n       Joshua Ladau 3 , \n       \n       Jose C.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality\n      electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary\n      2D materials.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 7 August 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 26 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      617-621\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1240837\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yair Rosenthal 1 , * , \n       \n       Braddock K.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades.

Shotgun metagenomic data suggested that these spatial patterns\n      were associated with strong shifts in carbon dynamics. We show that metagenomic approaches can be used to reconstruct below-ground\n      biogeochemical and diversity gradients in endangered ecosystems; such information could be used to improve restoration efforts,\n      given that even small changes in below-ground microbial diversity can have important impacts on ecosystem processes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 25 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 2 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      624-628\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243825\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yadong Sun 1 , * , \n       \n       Lei Li 2 , * , \n       \n       Alberto P.

Flg22 binding\n      induces FLS2 heteromerization with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1\u2013associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and their reciprocal activation\n      followed by plant immunity. Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22. Our data reveal the\n      molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-BAK1 complex recognition of flg22 and provide insight into the immune receptor complex\n      activation.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 26 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      628-632\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241097\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Creative Research Initiatives, Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Spemannstrasse 35, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

In addition\n      to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly\n      and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature\n      ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical\n      phonon-scattering limit.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years\n      beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer\n      by 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both\n      water masses were ~0.9\u00b0C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65\u00b0 warmer than in recent\n      decades.

Flg22 binding\n      induces FLS2 heteromerization with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1\u2013associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and their reciprocal activation\n      followed by plant immunity. Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22. Our data reveal the\n      molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-BAK1 complex recognition of flg22 and provide insight into the immune receptor complex\n      activation.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 26 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      628-632\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241097\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Creative Research Initiatives, Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Spemannstrasse 35, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author. E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

We show that metagenomic approaches can be used to reconstruct below-ground\n      biogeochemical and diversity gradients in endangered ecosystems; such information could be used to improve restoration efforts,\n      given that even small changes in below-ground microbial diversity can have important impacts on ecosystem processes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 25 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 2 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      624-628\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243825\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Yadong Sun 1 , * , \n       \n       Lei Li 2 , * , \n       \n       Alberto P.

Flg22 binding\n      induces FLS2 heteromerization with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1\u2013associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and their reciprocal activation\n      followed by plant immunity. Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22. Our data reveal the\n      molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-BAK1 complex recognition of flg22 and provide insight into the immune receptor complex\n      activation.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 26 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 30 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      628-632\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1241097\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       1 Creative Research Initiatives, Department of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.\n       \n       \n        2 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department of Molecular Biology, Spemannstrasse 35, 72076 T\u00fcbingen, Germany.\n       \n       \n       \u21b5 \u2020 Corresponding author.

Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

Flg22 binding\n      induces FLS2 heteromerization with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1\u2013associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and their reciprocal activation\n      followed by plant immunity. Here, we report the crystal structure of FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains complexed with flg22 at 3.06\n      angstroms. A conserved and a nonconserved site from the inner surface of the FLS2 solenoid recognize the C- and N-terminal\n      segment of flg22, respectively, without oligomerization or conformational changes in the FLS2 ectodomain. Besides directly\n      interacting with FLS2, BAK1 acts as a co-receptor by recognizing the C terminus of the FLS2-bound flg22.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

We identified aneuploid neurons, as well as numerous subchromosomal CNVs\n      in euploid neurons. Neurotypic hiPSC-derived neurons had larger CNVs than fibroblasts, and several large deletions were found\n      in hiPSC-derived neurons but not in matched neural progenitor cells. Single-cell sequencing of endogenous human frontal cortex\n      neurons revealed that 13 to 41% of neurons have at least one megabase-scale de novo CNV, that deletions are twice as common\n      as duplications, and that a subset of neurons have highly aberrant genomes marked by multiple alterations. Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

E-mail: jahn{at}korea.ac.kr \n      \n     \n      Chilly Repression Stalls Flowering \n      In a cool spring, flowering might be delayed compared to a warm spring, even though the change in day length marches on regardless\n      of temperature. Lee et al. (p. 628 , published online 12 September; see the Perspective by Nilsson ) now show that this delay in flowering is a regulated process, not simply a consequence of sluggish metabolism. In the model\n      plant Arabidopsis , transcription of the gene encoding the regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is unaffected by temperature, but the stability\n      of the SVP protein is decreased at higher temperatures. Its regulatory partner, FLOWERING LOCUS M ( FLM )- \u03b2 , is the product of alternative splicing of transcripts from the gene encoding FLM that favors the \u03b2 form at lower temperatures.\n      SVP and FLM-\u03b2 form a complex that represses flowering. At lower temperatures, more of the repressive complex is present and\n      flowering is delayed. At higher temperatures, SVP tends to degrade and FLM-\u03b2 tends not to be produced, yielding reduced levels\n      of the repressive complex, which allows flowering to proceed.\n      \n     \n     \n      Abstract \n      \n      Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering\n      agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-\u03b2 , an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M , increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-\u03b2 interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded\n      at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The\n       svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP\u2013FLM-\u03b2 repressor complex abundance\n      via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to\n      ambient temperature changes.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 May 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 3 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      632-637\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1243472\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Michael J.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

Our results show\n      that mosaic CNV is abundant in human neurons.\n      \n      \n     \n     \n      Received for publication 19 July 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 1 October 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      pp.\n      \n      637-640\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.1242576\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n       Hanna Sabelstr\u00f6m 1 , \n       \n       Moa Stenudd 1 , \n       \n       Pedro R\u00e9u 1 , 2 , \n       \n       David O.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of\n      the scar, as it is made by several different cell types, which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show\n      that scarring by neural stem cell\u2013derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further\n      axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover, neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival\n      of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar, deriving from resident neural stem cells, is\n      required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.\n      \n      \n     \n      Received for publication 28 June 2013.\n      \n      Accepted for publication 23 September 2013.\n      \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\t\n   \t\t\n   \n   \n    \n    \n     Prev \n     | Table of Contents | Next \n     \n     \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-a\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n     Products & Materials \n     \n     \n      Summary \n      \n      A weekly roundup of information on newly offered instrumentation, apparatus, and laboratory materials of potential interest\n      to researchers.\n      \n      \n      \n     Read the Full Text \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      Article Views \n      \n       Summary \n        Full Text \n        Full Text (PDF) \n       \n      \n      \n       Save to My Folders\n         \n        Download Citation \n        Alert Me When Article is Cited \n       \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           Post to CiteULike \n          \n          \n         What's this? \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         E-mail This Page \n        Rights & Permissions \n        Commercial Reprints and E-Prints \n       \n      \n      \n       \n         Load related web site information \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          Science Magazine \n         Web of Science \n        \n       \n        \n         Web of Science \n         Load citing article information \n         CrossRef \n         Citing articles via Scopus \n        \n       \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     My Science \n     \n      My Folders \n      My Alerts \n      My Saved Searches \n      Sign In \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-b\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n    \n     The editors suggest the following Related Resources on Science sites\n     \n     In \n      Science Magazine\n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Science \n      1 November 2013:\n       \n      Vol. 342 \n       \n      no. 6158 \n       \n      p.\n      \n      641\n       \n      \n      DOI:\n      10.1126/science.342.6158.641-c\n       \n      \n      \n     \n    \n    Science Webinar Series \n     \n     \n   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \t\t\n     \n      \t\t\t To Advertise | Find Products \n      \t\t\n     \n     \t\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \n    \n       \n        \n       \n        Density and topology of the cortical graph.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: To judge by Time Square today, Sandy seemed to be more of a myth, but downtown it's clear the Big Apple took a big hit.  UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Yeah, look at his whole neighborhood right here.  UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Aw, man.  UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The system that carries five million riders every day still a deluged tunnel of darkness.  UNIDENTIFIED #4: Block after block, mile after mile of this kind of ruins. And in that wreckage behind me, we can hear the gas lines hissing.  UNIDENTIFIED #5: The Jersey Shore of my youth where we used to go all the time, it is gone.  FLATOW: Those were the sounds from one year ago when Superstorm Sandy slammed into the New York region. The epic storm destroyed and reshaped parts of the coastline. It moved sand and cement, homes and habitats. Politicians vowed to rebuild. New York Mayor Bloomberg put out his own proposal for long term sustainable planning. New Jersey Governor Christie, the last voice in that montage, said his state would rebound and the federal government, after months of talking, allocated $51 billion for recovery.  But what would it really take to build back smarter - adding back the sand, nourishing the beaches as it's called, putting buildings up on stilts? Or maybe we shouldn't rebuild all of it and instead, retreat in some places from the coastline as rising seas promise to bring back big storm surges. That's what we'll be talking about this hour.  Our number is 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-TALK. You can also tweet us @SciFri. And if you want more information, you can go to our website, it's ScienceFriday.com. Let me introduce my guest. Robert Young is a professor of coastal geology and the director of the program for the study of developed shorelines at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ROBERT YOUNG: Great to be with you, Ira.  FLATOW: Thank you. Joseph Vietri is the director of the National Planning Center for Coastal and Storm Damage for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in New York. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  JOSEPH VIETRI: Thank you for having me.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Phil Orton. Philip Orton is a research scientist in physical oceanography at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, which really got hit hard by Sandy. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  PHILIP ORTON: Thank you for having me.  FLATOW: Joe, let me ask you to bring us up to date on what is the Army Corps doing now. What is it working on now?  VIETRI: Well, the Corps of Engineers has looked at this as a multi-prong approach. One is to try to stabilize the existing situation in the short term, secondly by looking at what studies or evaluations were under way prior to Sandy and looking to re-tool those based on the information and the knowledge gained actually during Sandy.  And then lastly, looking at the long term consequences on a regional scale as to, again, much like your intro mentioned, to see what would be the suite of options that would be available to us across the region, including, of course, relocations, elevating houses, et cetera. So right now, in the short term, we are basically repairing our existing portfolio of projects that were damaged as a result of Hurricane Sandy. That is, those jobs that were previously constructed and served as that sacrificial, you know, fill for absorbing the storm energy associated with Sandy.  So we're working on that right now and we're also going about in a really expeditious manner in terms of trying to make sure that all of our navigation channels that received increased sedimentation are also addressed as part of Sandy. And at the same time we're looking at the long term.  FLATOW: In the short term you're putting - you're refilling the beaches with sand and putting - elevating homes. Let's talk about the houses. How does the elevation or the putting them up on stilts work?  VIETRI: Well, in many of the locations here, we have homes. We have a barrier island system and then of course we have an estuary and a back bay environment. Typically on Long Island, in one stretch, 83 miles from Fire Island to Montauk Point, we had been working on a plan for probably over a decade to elevate about 4,500 homes that are located within the 10-year flood plain.  To put that into context for you, there are approximately 27,000 homes that are located in the 100-year flood plain and that is with our sea level rise and our numbers as we see them now. If you were to extrapolate this, you know, say, 50 years, 100 years into the future, the number could quadruple.  So obviously you see, as time moves on here, we have a very severe problem that we have to address.  FLATOW: And who pays for elevating all those houses?  VIETRI: Well, in some cases it's been a combination of different authorities. In some cases, using community block grant money through Housing and Urban Development. The states have started, undertaken some of this work. There has been some work undertaken in the past, prior to, you know, with FEMA funding. Individual homeowners have chosen to do it, some of them themselves.  And then, of course, lastly, the Corps of Engineers is looking at that elevation of that 4,500 homes and that would be borne by the federal government also.  FLATOW: So mostly, we're talking about taxpayer money, local, federal...  VIETRI: That is correct.  FLATOW: Rob Young, do you think elevating houses and structures is the way to go here?  YOUNG: Well, if the structures are going to remain in place, you'd certainly rather have them elevated than not. The problem with relying on elevating structures as your primary adaptation measure following a storm like Sandy is that it doesn't remove the property from the hazard area. It just lifts the property up above the hazard area.  So, for example, if you're on the ocean front or an estuarine shoreline, and we raise your home, you may be raised above the flood, but that doesn't stop the coastal erosion and it doesn't stop long term sea level rise. So if elevating properties is your primary response, then that means that we still have to commit ourselves to holding the shoreline in place in front of those properties for the foreseeable future.  So, you know, to me, simply relying primarily on elevating structures, which is what we've been doing post-Sandy, is problematic in the long run.  FLATOW: And your solution would be what?  YOUNG: Well, we need to begin a strategy where some of these oceanfront resort communities in particular, where those properties that are the most vulnerable in areas where there's repeat damage and identifiable risk from a scientific perspective, and the scientists and hazard specialists know where these places are, local emergency managers know where these places are, you know, we need to begin a managed retreat from those areas.  And when I say managed retreat, I don't mean we go in there and we rip the houses down. That's now how we do things in the United States, and I'm not suggesting that we abandon the shore. What it means is that in these areas that have experienced repeat damage, where there's particularly high vulnerability, we should be pulling public funds.  And if those individuals continue to choose to invest in those areas, they should be doing it on their own dime.  FLATOW: Phil Orton, you work with ocean modeling and that means making a computer model out of the oceans and of storm systems. Do you have Sandy as a computer model now?  ORTON: Yes, we do. And we've been very eager to get a good sample of Sandy - a good model of Sandy from the weather to the storm surge side, so we've put a lot of effort into that. We've got many storms that we can test, we can sort of throw at the coastline and run experiments on.  FLATOW: And you can see how the coastline would react and the consequences of the storm?  ORTON: Well, for just studying the flooding, that's much simpler, the flooding and the waves, so the storm tide and the waves. Studying how the erosion occurs is much more complex and we aren't doing that at Stevens Institute.  FLATOW: I heard one meteorologist say that back in, was it 1992, there was that famous perfect storm that they made the novel and the movie out of. And the reason no one really talked about it until the novel and the movie came out is that it never really hit shore. It was sort of out in the ocean. Is that correct?  ORTON: Yeah. Oh, and one correction. At Stevens Institute, with our group, we're not modeling erosion of the coast, but of course we have several researchers studying the erosion of the coast with other techniques. And on the perfect storm, your question there, the perfect storm is a very good example of something similar to Sandy where it was a hurricane that came up the North Atlantic and it made a left turn in 1991, I think.  And we've got a model of that storm, too, actually. And it hovered south of Cape Cod and it never made landfall anywhere. But it was the highest ever storm surge at Boston.  FLATOW: Joe, you were working during that perfect storm, were you not?  VIETRI: I certainly was, and much of the plans that we're working on now came about as a result of some of the responses to that storm. I also want to back up just one moment and just address one issue that came up here about this notion of resort communities. If you really look at these areas that were particularly hard hit in Long and New York City - Rockaway, Coney Island, Long Beach - I would suggest to you that they're probably anything but resort communities. In fact, they're regular blue collar working people who go to work every day. And if you think about it from the notion of a patient who goes to the hospital who's bleeding profusely, you don't really sit down with that patient and discuss their long-term prognosis. You first try to stop the bleeding while you have this more meaningful, you know, conversation about their long term prognosis.  And so our approach has been to that, and even as recently as this morning the president released his executive order on looking at the effect and trying to prepare communities for the changes in climate change and sea level rise. So we take this notion very, very seriously, and you know, I would like to tell you it started with '92. But it did not. You know, if you look in the Long Island, New York City area, we can go back to '38, we can go back to 1960, 1962, 1992, seems like every 30 years we have this so-called storm of the century, each one having a catastrophic effect on our landscape.  Now, difference here on this one is Sandy actually has gotten people to actually start sitting down and talking about the effects of sea level rise and climate change. I've been doing this for 30 years and this is the first time that I've gotten this kind of what I would like to say interactive dialogue going on with all levels of government and all levels of - excuse me - on what the long term solution set might look like.  FLATOW: And do they want to - is it possible to discuss something that might take 50 years to plan for?  VIETRI: You have - all of this is not about engineering and science in my opinion. This is about societal and political will. It is about the ability to change behaviors and behavior patterns. And so no, they don't want to talk about that. What they want to really talk about is what's going to happen for me today. I'm out of my house, thousands of people are still homeless. What are we doing to get people back in those communities?  Now, I would agree with you, we do have to look at this long term, and you have to look at it down, you know, into 50 years and 100 years into the future, because some of these locations might be untenable, you know, that far out into the future, some of these barrier islands, etc. So you have to stop the bleeding while at the same time you're trying to talk to them about what the long-term consequences of some of these actions are that are currently in place.  FLATOW: Rob Young, do you think it's possible to do that.  YOUNG: Well, which is exactly why we need a plan in place when storms hit. I mean the problem with our response to Hurricane Sandy is that we had no plan for what we were going to do following a storm like this. You know, we learned almost no lessons from Katrina. So you know, you're absolutely right that it's very difficult to go into these communities in the middle of an emergency and develop a managed retreat plan on the fly.  And so the easiest thing to do when you have no plan is to basically do what we were doing before. And you know, I think part of the problem is that many of the projects that the Corps designs for coastal protection, beach nourishments projects, they actually have sort of a 50 year planning horizon, and I think that gives much of the public the impression that it's going to be possible to hold all these shorelines in place for 50 years. And you know, I simply think that that's impractical. And I'm not saying that there aren't some...  FLATOW: Alright, you're getting - we'll talk more about it. I've got to go to a break. Talking with Robert Young, Joseph Vietri and Phil Orton. We'll be right back after this break. Stay with us.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow, this is SCIENCE FRIDAY. We're talking with Robert Young, Joseph VIETRI and Philip Orton about lessons learned Hurricane then Superstorm Sandy. Our number, 1-800-989, 8255. And when I rudely interrupted Rob Young, he was telling us about whether it's possible - you were sort of critical of the Army Corps of Engineers there. It sounded to me - and I will ask our guest, Joe, about this - it sounds like they are trying to figure out long-term solutions but they have the politics involved also.  YOUNG: Well, the Corps has got a tough job. You know? I mean they have demands placed on them from all different quarters, and they are typically asked for a level of protection that, you know, I think is impossible to guarantee. And to finish the thought that I was in the middle of, if you don't mind, what I was saying is that there probably are some places where beach nourishment makes sense. But the fact of the matter is, we can't do it everywhere. And right now we don't have a good national plan that allows us to look at the entire East Coast, the entire Gulf Coast, and from a national perspective do a very good job bringing in the best science and the best engineering and the best economics to decide where we're going to spend that money.  Right now our spending is purely reactive. We have a big storm and, you know, the Corps is given approximately $4 billion that they need to spend in the North Atlantic division on coastal protection projects. Is that the best place to spend it? Maybe. But it sure would be nice if we had, you know, a well-organized scientific national plan to prioritize that spending.  FLATOW: Phil, what happens when you add good - you add barriers and you restore the wetlands and you put them into your storm model, because that's what some people are saying, you know, we got to get those barrier islands, not just make sand dunes, we've got to create real, real living islands there and restore the wetlands because they will help sop up some of the damage that occurs. So what happens when you put that in your model?  ORTON: Well, barrier islands are probably the best protection you can have for a back bay region, although it depends on how wide and deep the inlets are into the back bays. But barrier islands are a very good protection, and they are already there, in most places. The wetlands that are often in the embayments have been degrading a lot, especially in urban areas due largely to nitrogen inputs from sewage treatment. And those wetlands as they - when they're there and they're strong, they can reduce flooding. There's sort of a rule of thumb, which is very approximate, but it does give some sense of how much wetland area you need. And that is that it takes a few miles of wetland to reduce the flood type by about a foot.  So there is a little bit of a misnomer for urban areas, that you can have a hundred feet of wetland and that might help protect a, you know, urban waterfront. You really need these big, big coastal areas.  FLATOW: Big coastal areas. You ran an experiment, which you tried a 20-foot high reef outside of New York Harbor in your model, did you not? What happened there?  ORTON: Oh, well, we ran - you know, a lot of this is experimentation with the designers and myself putting out ideas; the landscape designers, and then testing them out in the model. And so, one idea was to have a large reef offshore of the mouth of Raritan Bay, sort of where the entrance channel to New York Harbor comes in, Ambrose Channel.  And it actually didn't work. It didn't reduce - the idea was that it would reduce wave breaking into the harbor, which can raise sea levels a small amount inside the harbor, but it actually didn't help. For the one storm we studied with that experiment, which was Hurricane Donna from 1960. We may get a different result for a category 3 hurricane test that we're planning on doing, or for Sandy, but.... But so far, that was one of the non-successes.  FLATOW: Mm-huh. And another idea you explored is shallowing the shipping channels, for example in Jamaica Bay, right there by where JFK Airport is. What could that do?  ORTON: Yeah, so, you know, shipping channels into our major ports like Newark and Elizabeth are very important to our regions' economies. But there's certain shipping channels now that are used much less frequently like Rockaway and the shipping channels along the northern and southern parts of Jamaica Bay, which are where the populations are around Jamaica Bay. And right now they basically deliver the storm surge water very quickly without any attenuation around the shallow areas and the wetland areas in the center of the bay. They just deliver it straight to the neighborhoods.  So, one thing that we realized early on - and we saw with experimentation - was that the wetlands don't reduce the flooding on their own very much. They can reduce waves, and that helps. But if you combine, if you just have a shallowing of these deep channels, then it can slow the water reaching those neighborhoods and force it more into the wetlands instead of going around them.  And you can reduce the flooding for a storm like Sandy by several feet, or even eliminate flooding altogether inside the bay after the water travels over 10 kilometers of shallower water.  FLATOW: Joe Vietri, speaking for the Corps, what do you say are the components of a good coastal defense?  VIETRI: Well, I think there's two things. One, just backing up a second on this lack of a comprehensive strategy. One of the things that came about as a result of the Sandy Supplemental Bill is the fact that the Corps of Engineers was given $20 million to develop a regional and comprehensive evaluation of the long-term risk and vulnerability along the entire North Atlantic shoreline, roughly about 31,000 miles.  And I just want to say for the record that, you know, some of the things we are looking at is strategic retreat in addition to all the suite of nonstructural and structural solution sets.  But in terms of what the Corps looks at in terms of what we would see adequate defenses, we like to think of it as tiered levels of defense, much like in old Medieval times, you had the castle wall. And but before you got to that castle wall, you had a moat, you maybe had a killing field, you had something else. And so for us, and I think this has been borne out time and time again, certainly in our performance evaluation of the project immediately in the aftermath of Sandy, we've seen where you had a very healthy beach dune system you tended to have far, far less damages than where you did not.  So, clearly for us it would be a healthy barrier island system including, you know, a decent berm in the dune system. And then a very healthy estuary. And, you know, in these ecological features in the estuaries, whether it be marsh or salt marsh or islands, etc., etc., are also suffering the same threats that our population centers are as well. They are also taking the hit associated with in addition to the, you know, the nitrogen loading. But also, you know, basically, you change the sea level rise, have a potential to affect them dramatically, as well as, you know, basically, settlement of these wetlands.  So we're losing a large amount of wetlands. And this is going on around the country. You definitely see it in Jamaica Bay, Great South Bay and Riches Bay in our area.  So, for us, we like to look at as basically a combination of gray and green infrastructure, and so, with tiered levels of defense, and I think that is basically going to be right now, and it's certainly started in coastal Mississippi, and it's carrying its way forward here into the New York region, as what you're going to see coming out of a lot these activities that are being undertaken both by the Corps as well as others. The mayor's plan just recently released also relies heavily on this tiered levels of defense.  FLATOW: Rob Young, what's wrong with these sort of soft infrastructure ideas that have - sounds like a reasonable plan. Critique it for us.  YOUNG: Well, building beaches, through beach fill projects is, certainly in my opinion, a better way to protect coastal infrastructure than building massive seawalls is. If you build those seawalls, you're going to have to pump a beach up in front of them anyway. But I think we should understand, and we need to remember that these beaches used to be ecosystems. And there are beaches in New Jersey that don't have a natural grain of sand on them. I mean, they're completely artificial constructs now designed to protect property.  And if you're building beach fill projects as storm protection projects rather than ecosystem restoration projects, then, you know, you have a totally different set of criteria in mind. And if you look at some of the, quote-unquote, \"natural dunes\" that are being built in some of the post-Sandy projects, you know, these are giant trapezoids. They don't look like natural dune fields anymore. We're not building ecosystems on our beaches. We're replacing them with storm protection projects, and in some places where we've been doing this for a long time, that's probably an appropriate response.  But it's not a model that we'd like to export to the entire United States of America. It's hard to find beaches in some states nowadays that have never had fill dumped on them, and I don't think we have any idea what the cumulative impacts of doing all of these projects will be on the near shore Benthic environment. You know, the Corps is planning on moving 20 to 20 million cubic yards of sand in New Jersey and New York post-Sandy over the next couple of years, and, you know, that's equivalent to removing - making holes the size of 10 large football stadiums to borrow that sand, and then you spread it along the beach and bury the near shore surf zone with that material.  And in some places it might be appropriate, but, you know, I think that we don't have any real perspective on what the long-term cumulative environmental impacts are of doing these kinds of projects, and we're only going to have to do them more frequently in the future.  FLATOW: Joe Vietri of the Corps, are you - is that the kind of thing that you're going to be doing, or are you going to be - I thought I heard you say it requires a lot more....  (LAUGHTER)  VIETRI: ...deal with the factual inaccuracies in that statement, which, you know, these projects are heavily monitored there. It is true there has been a lot of sand placement along these shorelines going back probably since the 1930s and even maybe before. There's a large body of evidence and a large body of historical evidence that supports that in a lot of these locations there is no environmental impact, you know, to doing this type of practice.  Now, is this the solution set for the long-term and well into the future? I would agree, you know, with Professor Young. I think that we have to look at other solution sets. And it really is a function of both, one, a financial ability to do this. If you look at, you know, the different sea level rise scenarios, it's been about 12 inches in 100 years, midpoint, let's say we're talking probably about two feet.  But we could go up as high as six feet in 100 years. And so, you know, when you get into those upper regions of that curve, you know, and those kind of numbers, all bets are off. You know, it really is a question of what is the economic viability of this. If you're talking about it in terms of renourishment sequence even at the highest maximum level of six feet in 100 years, these beaches are maintained roughly every four years.  Map real quickly, you'll see you're dealing with only about a three inch change in sea level rise in any one nourishment period. The good part about the renourishment is if you stop it, things go back to the way they were fairly quickly. And I would agree 100 percent - I am very much and we are very much do not recommend walls or any kind of vertically aligned structures along an open ocean coastline.  We tend to look for these more softer solutions, which is beach fill. And until such time as the economics don't work or we see some sort of environmental consequence, right now that remains in the tool bag available for, you know, use. It doesn't mean it's the only thing. It doesn't mean it should be used everywhere, but it should certainly remain in the tool bag.  FLATOW: Phil Orton, you've said that one of the things in your tool bag that you've explored would be landscape architecture in the form of oyster-tecture. What is oyster-tecture about?  ORTON: Oyster-tecture is the concept of growing oyster reefs as wave breaking coastal protection in harbor areas in particular. And, I mean, it's a good thing to steer toward here. We've only been talking about the open shore mainly and back bays so far but when we think about New York Harbor, we've just got such large populations that the thought of retreat is even more difficult to think about.  And so we're looking at New York Harbor and Staten Island shores and we're looking at how these reefs could, on one hand, be used to reduce the physical threat and prove physical resiliency of the shoreline by reducing the wave heights that could overtop the coastal barriers or dunes or whatever's there.  But also having community interaction, schools involved, and this is already actually occurring in New York Harbor with Governor's Island Harbor School and landscape design. So having more community involvement, education, people actually involved in building these protections and seeding these oyster reefs, and then having more...  FLATOW: So how big would the - how big would an oyster reef be?  ORTON: Let me just...  FLATOW: How high would it be?  ORTON: Yeah. Let me finish that one thought. And so then you can also have social resilience also by having people actually interact with the hazard, the tides, the water, and know more about it and not be surprised, as they were with Sandy, that, you know, the peak flooding came at high tide and that it got over the landscaped, you know, edge and came into their neighborhoods.  They'll have more of an understanding of the hazards. So you have sociological resilience on top of physical resilience.  FLATOW: Let me remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Rob Young, Phil Orton, and Joe Vietri. I'm sorry to keep interrupting you, Phil. Go ahead. Finish up that thought on the oysters because that's fascinating.  ORTON: Yeah. So the heights of the reefs, it depends on where you are, but the idea is that they fill most of the water - you know, that oysters can grow up to near the sea surface, you know, so they may dry during low tide and be wet during high tide. And then when there's a storm then the waves in the harbor which, you know, you don't get huge waves in New York Harbor in particular but you could imagine Barnegat Bay also as another site we're looking at.  JOE VIETRI: Or Raritan Bay in front of Staten Island. And you can get pretty large waves and so these could break those large waves before they reach the waterfront.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And this could be undertaken locally by the local population? Or would they need assistance?  ORTON: Yeah. It's something that's already occurring with a fair amount of success. You know, the history of New York Harbor is that it was one of \u2014 maybe the world's leading oyster capital for harvesting oysters 150 years ago to 100 years ago. And then of course pollution wiped it out. So there are schools \u2014 there's a lot of groups right now in sort of a frenzy about oysters.  And oysters on, you know, like I said, they can reduce - so it's being successful already to regrow them in the harbor. One thing I'd say is that they can reduce wave heights but they're not very good for reducing the total flood height. So they can prevent the waves from overtopping a waterfront, you know.  But they're not as good throughout - you know, even if you put them throughout the harbor it's not clear from the modeling so far that they reduce flooding very much as a mean water level during a storm surge.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. How accurate, Phil, is our knowledge of what the sea level rise is going to be if you're going to plan for it? How do we know what it's going to be like in 10 or 15 years?  ORTON: Well, the New York City Panel on Climate Change just put out a new assessment of sea level rise locally in our area and we have a little bit of land subsidence so it's a little bit different than the global sea level rise value. And also there's some ocean circulation changes that look like they're causing sea level rise to be worse across our region.  So the estimate for the 2050s, I think the low end estimate, you know, it's quite a bit uncertainty. I think the mean estimate is about a foot and a half of sea level rise by the decade of the 2050s. But the low end is more like nine inches and the upper end is more like three feet. So it's a very large uncertainty still, unfortunately.  FLATOW: If I looked at those charts correctly, it looked like Florida was really in the bull's eye of that sea rise.  ORTON: Florida is in a lot of danger if you compare New York City's sea level rise problem to Florida, to Miami sea level rise problem. Miami, if you get a sea level rise of maybe six feet - or one way to put it is for every foot, and this is based on the Surging Sea's tool online from Climate Center, you can dial up different sea level rise levels.  And in Florida with every foot of sea level rise beyond maybe two feet, they start losing the space to high tide, that five or ten percent, with every extra foot of the population that lives on around Miami. So you think of six feet of sea level rise they lose a massive amount of their populated area. And fortunately, New York City has a lot of high ground and we only lose about one percent of the populated land area.  You know, the area that population lives on. Only about one percent of the people lose their land area for every foot of sea level rise. So it's a little bit better for New York City that we do have some high ground.  FLATOW: Well, we're going to have to leave it there. This is certainly just the start of a conversation about the new normal and how to deal with the flooding coastlines.

They're sticking plastic rods down the noses of 6-month old calves, collecting samples of bacteria.  \"This bacteria, Mannheimia haemolytica , lives in most cattle,\" explains Mike Apley , one of the research leaders. Sometimes, for reasons that aren't well understood, those bacteria make cattle sick. When that happens, or when it just seems likely to happen, cattlemen deploy antibiotics.  Apley hopes to find out, among other things, whether those antibiotics actually work as advertised. If they don't, he says, it's an easy decision to not use them. Farmers save money, and meat industry critics, who want farmers to use fewer antibiotics, are happy too. \"It's a win-win for everyone.\" \n \n\n \n \n\n Unfortunately, when it comes to antibiotics on the farm, it's not always a win-win. And when there's a fight, veterinarians are right in the middle of it, pushed back and forth by conflicting loyalties.  To understand those pressures, I paid a visit to veterinarian Steven Henry in Abilene, Kan. Henry is a leading swine specialist.  Pork producers rely heavily on veterinarians like Henry for advice. \"They don't want to spend money on drugs if they don't need to,\" says Henry. \"Now, you have to juxtapose that with a tremendous amount of pressure from pharmaceutical companies to move product.\"  Those companies aim advertising campaigns at farmers and veterinarians alike. Henry says he dismisses it, but others are influenced. As a result, farmers sometimes use more drugs than they should.  In addition, many veterinarians have a financial interest in such decisions. They resell antibiotics to farmers.  \"There's some margin in there for the veterinarian, so there's some incentive for the veterinarians to sell more,\" says Henry. \n \n\n In Denmark, the government took away that incentive in 1994; it stopped veterinarians from earning profits on such sales. The next year, antibiotic use dropped by almost 25 percent. (The Danish government also banned sales of one antibiotic that year, which may account for part of the decline.) Since then, Denmark has passed other regulations limiting antibiotic use in agriculture.  But Henry says he still trusts veterinarians, more than any regulations by government, to make sure antibiotics are used wisely. When veterinarians enter the profession, in fact, they swear an oath to protect animals and also promote public health.  But they soon develop other loyalties, too \u2014 above all to farmers, who in turn are driven by the need to earn a living.  Antibiotics can make meat production more efficient. Some drugs are used to make animals grow faster. Others reduce the risk of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle that are eating energy-rich diets of corn.  Mike Apley, the veterinarian at Kansas State, says those things matter when your clients are struggling to stay in business. \"The cost of production is a reality in food animal medicine and food animal production,\" he says.  Critics of the meat industry, though, say using antibiotics this way is irresponsible.  Anytime antibiotics are used, it increases the likelihood that bacteria will evolve resistance to them. Such drug-resistant bacteria can migrate, raising the risk of infections that doctors can't treat as easily.  Michael Blackwell , a veterinarian and former official at the Food and Drug Administration, says it's not acceptable to increase that risk just to produce meat more cheaply. Even if there's not clear evidence of harm right now, it's unwise to wait until it's too late, \"when there are literally bodies in the street.\"  \"We have got enough science to know that we need to act,\" says Blackwell, who also is a leader of the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association , and a critic of methods used by meat producers. Blackwell says antibiotics should only be used to fight disease, and only at \"therapeutic\" doses sufficient to kill virtually all disease-causing bacteria.  Kansas State's Mike Apley, for his part, says he's ready to stop advising meat producers to use any antibiotic if he's convinced that it could harm people. But he says the scientific evidence so far doesn't persuade him that's he's doing anything risky.  \"I want to fully support human health,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I don't want to remove valuable tools when that removal will not have a benefit for human health.\" He pauses. \"You know, we're really ... It's tough! It's tough!\"  It's tough because of scientific uncertainty, and also because veterinarians serve two masters: public health and food production.", "topics": [], "author": "Dan Charles, Morning Edition", "wordCount": 775}, {"date": "2013-10-31 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Heat, Drought Draw Farmers Back To Sorghum, The 'Camel Of Crops'", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/10/31/231509864/heat-drought-draw-farmers-back-to-sorghum-the-camel-of-crops?ft=1&f=1025", "text": "A test field of sorghum outside Manhattan, Kan., planted by Kansas State University. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n \n Much of the world is turning hotter and dryer these days, and it's opening new doors for a water-saving cereal that's been called \"the camel of crops\": sorghum. In an odd twist, this old-fashioned crop even seems to be catching on among consumers who are looking for \"ancient grains\" that have been relatively untouched by modern agriculture.  Sorghum isn't nearly as famous as the big three of global agriculture: corn, rice and wheat. But maybe it should be. It's a plant for tough times, and tough places.  Sorghum \"originated in the northeastern quadrant of Africa,\" explains Gebisa Ejeta , a plant scientist from Ethiopia and professor at Purdue University. From there, it spread across Africa, India and even into China. \"It's got a lot of characteristics that make it a favorite crop for the drylands of Africa and the semi-arid tropics.\"  It's an essential source of food in those regions, but it's not typically a big money crop. In Africa, it's grown by subsistence farmers. It's never gotten much attention from seed companies or investors.  But it is nutritious. It can grow in soils that other plants won't tolerate. Above all, it doesn't need much water. Compared with corn, for instance, it needs one-third less water, and it doesn't give up and wilt when rains don't come on time. It waits for moisture to arrive. \n \n\n It probably arrived in North America aboard slave ships. That traditional sorghum looks like an overgrown corn plant, up to 10 feet tall, with a head of seeds on top.  Today, American farmers grow two kinds of sorghum. Sweet sorghum is tall; you can use it to make a sweet syrup or just feed the whole plant to animals.  But most sorghum in the U.S. is grown for feed grain . That version of the plant is short, with seeds that come in several different colors.  Steve Henry showed me some near Abilene, Kan., on our way to the farm where he grew up. Kansas is the biggest sorghum-growing state. Out here, they call milo.  \"You've got white milo, red milo, yellow milo,\" says Henry, scanning the field. \"Basically, you have the little berries, and they're filled with starch, like like corn is filled with starch, and the starch is what we're after.\"  Sorghum is used for the same things as corn: high-energy feed for pigs and chickens. It also gets turned into ethanol.  But corn is far more popular. Corn produces a bigger harvest, and farmers earn bigger profits with it \u2014 at least when there's plenty of water. In the U.S., the amount of land in sorghum has been steadily shrinking.  There are signs, though, of a sorghum revival on the high plains. The reason is water, or the lack of it. From Nebraska to western Texas, cornfields have been fed with rivers of water pumped from underground aquifers, and that water is starting to run low .  Some farmers, such as Mitchell Baalman of Hoxie, Kan., are looking for crops that aren't quite so thirsty. \"We're learning a lot about milo,\" says Baalman. \"You know, nobody wants to grow milo out here; it's kind of a forgotten crop. But I tell you what, there's where our money's going to be made this year. It'll be on grain sorghum.\"  Ejeta, who won the World Food Prize in 2009 for his work on sorghum, says that sorghum's renaissance may depend on the price that farmers pay for water. \"If water is given its real value, and you limit irrigation, or people begin to pay for water, it would be economically smarter to grow sorghum in several areas of the United States,\" he says.  In the latest twist to the sorghum saga, it's actually becoming somewhat trendy among consumers who are looking for something a little different, and maybe a little more healthful.  \"Sorghum is naturally gluten-free; it's an ancient grain,\" says Earl Roemer, who set up a company called Nu Life Market to sell sorghum flour to big food companies . Roemer's sorghum mill in Scott City, Kan., is busy. \"Demand is exploding!\" he says. \"We're seeing 25 to 30 percent increase in demand, annually. We're doing all we can to increase production.\" His flour goes into gluten-free baked goods and is also used in breakfast cereals containing so-called ancient grains like quinoa, amaranth and spelt.  Every week, he says, visitors from food companies large and small make the trek to western Kansas to talk about new opportunities. Next week, he says, he's traveling to Taiwan to explore international markets.", "topics": [], "author": "Dan Charles, All Things Considered", "wordCount": 764}, {"date": "2013-10-30 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "How Much Water Actually Goes Into Making A Bottle Of Water?", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/10/28/241419373/how-much-water-actually-goes-into-making-a-bottle-of-water?ft=1&f=1025", "text": "Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       The amount of water to make the bottle could be up to six or seven times what's inside the bottle, according to the Water Footprint Network. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       The amount of water to make the bottle could be up to six or seven times what's inside the bottle, according to the Water Footprint Network.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Environmental activists have long claimed that bottled water is wasteful. Usually, they point to the roughly 50 billion (mostly plastic) bottles we throw away every year.  The International Bottled Water Association, ever sensitive to criticism that it's wasting precious resources, has commissioned its first ever study to figure out how much water goes into producing one liter. The results , released this month, show that for North American companies, it takes 1.39 liters to make one liter of water.  That's less than the global averages of a liter of soda, which requires 2.02 liters of water. A liter of beer, meanwhile, needs 4 liters of water, wine demands 4.74 liters. Hard alcohol, it turns out, is the greediest, guzzling 34.55 liters of water for every liter.  This, the bottled water industry says, is evidence that its product isn't so bad. \"Bottled water products are extremely efficient in terms of water use compared to some other packaged beverages,\" says Chris Hogan, spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association .  But water activists say the IBWA study highlights a problem throughout the beverage industry: Few companies take the whole water-use picture into account when calculating their water use. Just as companies are beginning to calculate their carbon footprint, they also need to analyze their water footprints to find opportunities for conservation.  Bottled water companies (along with many other beverage companies) should include the water in their supply chain, says Ertug Ercin with the Water Footprint Network . Ercin says a true water footprint includes all freshwater used in production, including the water used for packaging.  \"Packaging makes a significant footprint,\" he says, adding that three liters of water might be used to make a half-liter bottle. In other words, the amount of water going into making the bottle could be up to six or seven times what's inside the bottle.  Drilling for oil to make plastic, Ercin says, uses a substantial amount of groundwater. And you need water to make the paper, too, he adds.  Still, Ercin notes, bottled water packaging uses far less water than soda, which needs extra water to grow sugar and make dyes.  Hogan says that one reason why the IBWA didnt look at these issues is that it's hard to know where to stop. \"You could extrapolate that ad infinitum,\" he says.  Hogan says some companies say they don't think they can get any more efficient, but they're trying. \"Water,\" Hogan says,\" is the lifeblood of the industry and they want to be as efficient as possible.\"", "topics": [], "author": "Thomas Andrew Gustafson", "wordCount": 471}, {"date": "2013-10-28 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Scientists: Asian Carp Breeding In Great Lake Tributaries", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/10/28/241479062/scientists-asian-carp-breeding-in-great-lake-tributaries?ft=1&f=1025", "text": "Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Tommy Goszewski, a technician with the U.S. Geological Survey, holds a grass carp taken from a pond at an agency lab in Columbia, Mo., in spring 2013. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Tommy Goszewski, a technician with the U.S. Geological Survey, holds a grass carp taken from a pond at an agency lab in Columbia, Mo., in spring 2013.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Scientists have confirmed for the first time that at least one variety of Asian carp is living and breeding in the Great Lakes watershed, where it threatens stocks of native fish.  A U.S. Geological Survey and Bowling Green State University study published Monday says Asian carp taken from the Sandusky River in Ohio show the fish are \"the result of natural reproduction within the Lake Erie basin.\"  \"It's bad news,\" USGS Duane Chapman told The Associated Press. \"It would have been a lot easier to control these fish if they'd been limited in the number of places where they could spawn. This makes our job harder. It doesn't make it impossible, but it makes it harder.\"  According to a USGS statement:   \"If grass carp become abundant in Lake Erie, they may threaten native fish populations and could be detrimental to ducks, geese or other large aquatic birds. Grass carp were brought to the U.S. to control aquatic plants in the 1960s. They eat large quantities of aquatic plants, which could degrade areas important for spawning and early development of native fish.\"   While other species of Asian carp are of more concern than the Grass carp, all Asian carp require similar conditions to successfully reproduce, scientists say.

If you're just joining us, it's our annual Halloween program. And next up, an environmental villain. It's actually a sci-fi menace dreamed up a long time ago in film.  (SOUNDBITE OF FILM)  UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The distant stars. The lonely Earth. The 21st century and lurking beyond the strange immensity of conquered space, exploding in unspeakable horror, the green slime. The civilized world at war with alien forms, whose slimy touch means instant, horrible death. Invaders from beyond the stars, the Green Slime.  FLATOW: Ten points if you can name when that movie came out. I'm talking about toxic blue-green algae in our case. The filmmakers may have overstated its immediate danger. I think scientists are reasonably certain it doesn't come from beyond the stars. But as my next guest says, it is a real threat to environmental and human health and climate change may be making it worse.  Hans Paerl is a professor of marine and environmental sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Institute of Marine Sciences in Moorhead City, North Carolina. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Paerl.  HANS PAERL: Hi, Ira. How you doing?  FLATOW: Overdid it a bit in that movie?  PAERL: Well, you know, now I see how you fit the whole thing in.  (LAUGHTER)  FLATOW: The Halloween theme. And, yeah, it took a little work. Now, you just got back from China. I actually just got back from two weeks in China.  PAERL: Yeah. I was going to say ni hao.  FLATOW: Ni hao. You were studying an infestation of this blue-green slime, this algae. Tell us what you saw.  PAERL: Well, we've been working with the Chinese now for about four years on an NSF, US NSF, China NSF project that is geared towards, first of all, understanding how these organisms became as aggressive as they are in the lakes that we're working on. And secondly, how to manage them. How to get rid of them. I guess as you probably know, cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, have been around for a long time.  They have been on Earth for about two billion years. They were the first organisms that figured out how to split water and produce oxygen by photosynthesis. And they've seen lots of changes that have occurred on Earth, including, you know, the advent of oxygen itself but warming, cooling, glacial periods, etc. They have a playbook that is very, very sophisticated.  And they are now taking advantage of many of the changes that we're imposing on the environment, including too many nutrients, climate change, particularly warming, hydrologic modifications - building dams, for example, to slow down the water coming into our ecosystems. So, you know, we're playing into their playbook, basically.  FLATOW: Yeah. Tell us what you found in particular in China.  PAERL: Well, the lake that we've been working on is called Taihu. It actually means Big Water in Mandarin. It is a lake that is the third largest lake in China. It is a huge lake. It's 100 kilometers across. And the lake has changed, basically, from a very desirable diatom dominated lake - I don't know if that means anything to you, but diatoms are good algae. Good food source. To one that now has these massive signs of bacterial blooms(ph). They're paint-like scums that cover the lake from one side to the other, basically, now for eight months out of the year. So the lake's basically gone through a state change and we're trying to figure out how much the nutrients need to be reduced that are causing this problem and which nutrients need to be reduced in order to basically knock it back to a more desirable state.  FLATOW: Yeah. Isn't it true that basically if you turned on your tap water you've got green slime...  PAERL: Yep.  FLATOW: ...coming out of it?  PAERL: Well, that's what happened one morning in 2007 in a couple of the cities that use the lake for drinking water. And by the way, about 15 million people use the - in the Taihu basin use the lake for drinking water. One morning everyone woke up with this green slime, smelly slime, coming out of their faucet. What had happened was that the scums were so extreme that they basically overwhelmed the drinking water plant for a city named Wuxi of about five million people and basically knocked the water supply out of action. And the central government and provincial governments had to come in and provide bottled water for about, well, almost 10 million people for about six weeks before they got things back into order. So this basically was a crisis that started and it got the Chinese government mobilized into starting to do something about their surface water supplies.  Because Taihu is not the only lake that is impacted by this problem.  FLATOW: Now, if I remember correctly from my visits around China, isn't that lake the source of a lot of the ornamental rock that the Chinese use in their gardens and the temples?  PAERL: That's correct. In fact, if you go to Beijing's famous temple there...  FLATOW: Saw it.  PAERL: You saw it.  FLATOW: Yeah.  PAERL: It's kind of this foamy looking rock.  FLATOW: Yeah.  PAERL: That is hauled out of Taihu and put into prestigious places everywhere in China.  FLATOW: And so they really respect at least the sources of the rock where it's coming from.  PAERL: Oh, yeah. Well, Taihu is a revered lake. It is a lake that the Chinese have valued for, I guess, thousands of years. It's a place where people like to come to, to rest and take their vacations now. There are lots of four star hotels around the lake. And with this bloom problem, of course, it's thrown that business, you know, tourism, recreational business, fisheries, and water supply into turmoil.  So there's, you know, lots involved in terms of economics. But also health problems.  FLATOW: Yeah.  PAERL: Because these algae-produced toxins that can lead to anything - well, they range from liver disorders and, you know, if you drink the water long enough, very serious ailments, including cancer. And they also produce neurotoxins that can give people neurological symptoms that range from, you know, tingling in the fingers to Alzheimer's-like symptoms.  FLATOW: Can you boil the water and get rid of...  PAERL: No. Unfortunately, these compounds that are produced - they're called cyclic peptides - are very strong compounds in terms of not being able to digest them with boiling. So the only way to get them out is to use activated charcoal filtration, which is very expensive. And, you know, for 10 million people that is basically impractical. Or UV oxidation to break up the bonds in the compound itself.  FLATOW: Now, you hear a lot of stories about how bad the air pollution is - I certainly saw it there when I was in Beijing - and other environmental catastrophes like this one, but not a lot about what the government's doing about it. Is the government working actively to clean up this lake and understand the problem?  PAERL: Well, that's sort of the good news part of this story, I think, and that is that because of Taihu's notoriety as being a valuable place, the government has really mobilized its research and management power into, you know, coming up with a nutrient management strategy that will hopefully reduce these blooms and eventually eliminate them.  Something on the order of I believe $5 billion - or equivalent of $5 billion U.S. has been promised by the government to, quote, clean up Taihu. And some of the brightest scientists in China are working with us to, you know, help formulate a nutrient management strategy for the lake.  FLATOW: And how pervasive is it around the whole country and around the rest of the world?  PAERL: Very. And I would say that doesn't just involve developing countries, but countries that are well developed that are simply generating more waste, nutrients coming from land, agricultural nutrients as well as waste water nutrients. So it's a problem that is basically present on every continent except maybe the Antarctic.  FLATOW: Huh. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. You can also tweet us @scifri. You had a commentary in the journal Science this week talking about how climate change is only going to exacerbate this problem.  PAERL: Yeah. Well, correct. One thing about blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria - they're really synonymous; the microbiologists like to call them cyanobacteria, the botanists blue-green algae - but these organisms, they basically grow, they basically are bacteria. If you look at them under the microscope, they have all the structural characteristics of bacteria. No organized nucleus, no organelles.  And they grow like bacteria. Which means that they actually optimize their growth at quite high temperatures, somewhere around body temperature for us, for example. So as things get warmer, their growth rates get closer to the optimal whereas the growth rates of the other algae, the ones we like to have in the lake, actually are past their optimum.  So, you know, cyanos like it hot, so to speak. They, you know, global warming is basically playing into their playbook in the sense that it's optimizing their growth. So when you combine more nutrients coming in with warmer conditions, that's really kind of the perfect combination for them to become more aggressive invaders. And we can see this in lakes, for example...  FLATOW: Yeah.  PAERL: ...in high latitudes, for example, northern Europe and even the tip of South America, where the ice now goes out earlier, for example. Or some lakes don't have any ice on them at all anymore in the wintertime. So the conditions for them to be able to take over and be aggressive are much earlier in the year and they last much longer in the year because it takes longer for the ice to come on.  So there's, you know, there's a good formula for them to expand. The other thing is that when we warm up surface waters, it creates a stronger density difference between the surface water and the bottom water. The bottom water stays relatively cool. So as you increase the surface water, you create a situation that's more resistant to wind mixing, which is something that they like too.  Because they like to be buoyant and right up at the surface so they can take in all the light they can and basically dominate the entire water column, shading out the other algae.  FLATOW: Well, they've had eons of practice at this.  PAERL: They have.  FLATOW: Yeah.  PAERL: And, you know, I - when I teach classes on this subject, I generally equate them with cockroaches because they're unwelcome guests that once they get into your house, or once they get into your lake, they're very difficult to get rid of. And what the article in Science also points out is that there are several feedback situations that occur when they get into an ecosystem.  They basically create their own microenvironment by dominating the surface waters, controlling the light that passes through the water, and then as they die eventually, they sink to the bottom and create conditions whereby the nutrients can get rereleased back up into the water column and they're ready to go the next year.  FLATOW: Wow. We've got to stop feeding them. Thank you very much, Dr. Paerl, for taking time to be with us today.  PAERL: Thanks, Ira.

But in the years since, the problems are just as bad \u2014 and maybe even worse.  That's the conclusion of the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. This week, the center scolded the industry again with a review of how it has fared in the years since the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production released its original report. \n \n\n \"From a regulatory, or legislative, standpoint, we have actually regressed on many of these issues in the last five years,\" says Bob Martin, who served as executive director of the original Pew commission, which included policymakers and scientists. Martin is now a program director at the Center for a Livable Future.  Though the Pew commission is not a foodie household name, its 2008 report has subtly shaped many consumers' view of how our food animals are produced. It's not the rosy view \u2014 it's the highly critical one.  Back then, the commission identified the most worrisome systemic problems of producing 9.8 billion food animals every year in the U.S. It called out the animal agriculture industry for the excessive use of medically important antibiotics, particularly the industry's habit of giving animals low doses for nontherapeutic uses like growth promotion.  It also hammered the conventional system of handling of liquid waste from huge animal operations, and standard industry practices of confining animals in gestation crates and battery cages. And it called for enforcement of antitrust laws to restrict the concentration of the industry into a handful of companies that would have inordinate sway over the marketplace.  This year, the Center for a Livable Future set about to examine the impact of the original Pew report. The findings , released Tuesday, largely denounce the industry and the government agencies responsible for regulating them for not heeding the 2008 recommendations.  Martin says that while some companies have made strides in improving animal welfare, the overall trend is that the health, environmental and economic problems are getting worse.  Specifically, he says, the industry has failed to eliminate the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics \u2014 though the Food and Drug Administration has restricted the use of some specific drugs and set voluntary guidelines .  On the animal waste issue, Martin adds, the Environmental Protection Agency has not followed through with its promise to do a full inventory of waste practices and enact higher waste storage and disposal standards at concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, that the commission had recommended.  The meat industry, meanwhile, argues that it has made significant progress in improving its health and environmental impacts. The Animal Agriculture Alliance, a trade group representing various livestock interests, put out its own counter-report on Monday, heralding advances in animal care, responsible antibiotics use, food safety, environmental sustainability and industry research initiatives.  The pork industry also seemed peeved at being called intransigent by the commission. In a statement , the president of the National Pork Producers Council called the Pew report \"wrong in every aspect.\"  The Hopkins research center, meanwhile, says the industry has resisted reform by lobbying hard against stricter regulatory requirements.  \"I think that the power of the industrial animal agriculture sector is almost overwhelming,\" Martin says. \"These are very powerful private companies that give large campaign contributions and can influence legislators.\"  The government agencies responsible for policing the cattle, poultry and swine industries on health, the environment and conglomerations have thus been hampered in cracking down, he says.  \"The solution to the system being dysfunctional is not to keep putting a Band-Aid on it,\" says Martin. But the newest report notes that economic strains on the industry do not bode well for reform.", "topics": [], "author": "Eliza Barclay", "wordCount": 641}, {"date": "2013-10-23 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Are You A Sage Foodie?

So would Sam Eyde.  Rjukan, home to about 3,500 residents and situated about 70 miles west of the capital, Oslo, has installed a trio of giant mountaintop mirrors to focus light into the valley town's square during the cold (and dark) winter months.  Legend has it that on the advice of mathematician and inventor Archimedes, the town of Syracuse used parabolic reflectors to set fire to an attacking Roman fleet during the Siege of Syracuse. A hundred years ago, Eyde, a founder of Rjukan, first proposed adapting the idea to warm up the chilly town.  The three 550-square-foot mirrors, built at a cost of $825,000, couldn't stay focused for long without sensors and computer control to follow the sunlight and keep it aimed at the center of town. So, in Eyde's time the project wasn't practical. Instead, in 1928, the town built a cable car leading to the top of a mountain so residents could take a short ride to the warming sunlight.  \"The square will become a sunny meeting place in a town otherwise in shadow,\" according to the project's official website .  Here's a video from Reuters that gives some details: \n \n\n \"We think it will mean more activities in town, especially in autumn and wintertime,\" Karin Roe, head of the town's tourist office, is quoted by The Telegraph as saying. \"People will be out more.\"  A similar project was completed in 2006 in the small Italian town of Viganella.", "topics": [], "author": "Scott Neuman", "wordCount": 294}, {"date": "2013-10-23 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Diplomats Try For Deal Protecting Marine Life Near Antarctica", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=240163057&ft=1&f=1025", "text": "Diplomats are trying once again to preserve a vast swath of the ocean around Antarctica.

The relatively undisturbed waters are off the shore of Antarctica. Delegates meeting today in Australia are considering a proposal to create what would be the world's largest marine-protected area. Nations that fish in these waters have blocked earlier such efforts, as NPR's Richard Harris reports.  RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: The preserve would ban fishing in more than half-a-million square miles of the Ross Sea. Its home to rich marine life: seals, penguins and whales, including half of the world's orcas. But it's the region's fish that are causing all the trouble. Large commercial operations travel across the globe to harvest the Patagonian Tooth Fish, which is marketed in the United States as Chilean Sea Bass.  The United States and New Zealand have been trying to limit or eliminate fishing in this area, not only to preserve this species, but to safeguard a rich ecosystem that helps feed marine life far and wide. The group that regulates fishing off Antarctica held a special meeting in July to create this preserve, but that ended in failure, after Russia and Ukraine objected. So the U.S. and New Zealand have scaled back the size of the proposed preserve by 40 percent.  In the coming weeks, they will see if they can reach consensus among the 24 nations, plus the European Union, who together will make this decision. Conservation groups are pressing for a deal that would preserve these waters forever, but the length of a deal would also be subject to negotiation.  Richard Harris, NPR News.

This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. \n   The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. \n   It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. \n   The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. \n   This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. \n   Animal studies have shown changes to specific the brain in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. \n   Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. \n   Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. \n   Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. \n \"Just an excuse\" \n\t  Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. \n   I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's \"not my fault\" and therefore, \"I can't help it\". \n   This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. \n   Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. \n   Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. \n   Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. \n   Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. \n   But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. \n   Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. \n   What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.", "topics": [], "author": "Prof John Blundell", "wordCount": 582}, {"date": "2013-10-11 20:04:00", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "Meds in their sheds", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24355353#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "Anaesthetists by day, inventors by night \n\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n \n\n\n      Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. \n   Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. \n   But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. \n   David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. \n   Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered \"almost jokingly\" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. \n   And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. \n   So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. \n   And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. \n   The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. \n   Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: \"According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. \n   \"This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. \" \n \n Drs David Williams (left) and John Dingley (right) hard at work \n \n 'Shaken and stored' \n\t  At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. \n   As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. \n   \"That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes,\" Dr Williams said. \n   Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. \n   The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. \n   One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. \n   It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. \n \n Different attachments will allow doctors to look in eyes, ears and the throat \n \n  \"In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case,\" said Dr Williams. \n 'Home made' \n\t  According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. \n   \"Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication,\" he said. \n   In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. \n   Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. \n   He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. \n   Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: \"The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. \n   \"That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen.\" \n   The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. \n   Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. \n   But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire.", "topics": [], "author": "Smitha Mundasad", "wordCount": 812}, {"date": null, "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "AUDIO: Dementia violence police calls rise", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24804753#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "4 November 2013 Last updated at 13:43 GMT  A BBC investigation has found that police officers are being called in to deal with dementia patients who become confused and sometimes violent.

The strike, it seems, is over. \n   My left eyebrow, the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do - smile and blink. \n   Shortly after the onset of my Bell's palsy, in October last year, I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter. The response was overwhelming, with many, many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition. \n   So, exactly 12 months on, by way of returning some of that generosity, this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets. \n   Bell's palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight - and unwitting - members of a very strange club. There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they can't move half of their face. \n   Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company, including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan, it is not a club that anyone would choose to join. The paralysis can be shocking and, socially at least, very difficult to deal with. \n   The hardest part for me, as well as the loss of my smile, was the inability to close my left eye. Bell's Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open, unable even to blink, sometimes for months on end. \n   Of course, the other, unaffected eye carries on as normal, merrily blinking away. So, for the record, my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought I'd been winking at them for the past year or so. Except the barmaid in the Nag's Head. That was a wink. \n   The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting. With my left eye stuck open, the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same - in manic two-eyed stare - or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers. Move over Anne Robinson. \n \n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n    \n   \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Watch how John's face recovered over the course of a year \n\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n \n\n\n  Thankfully, as this video shows, at some time between the six- and nine-month mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again. \n   Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus, often at times of stress and lowered immunity, much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed. \n   The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear. Signals then cease to be transmitted along it, paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless. \n   The only treatment that has been shown to have significant, measurable benefit is a course of steroids, but it must be started early, within 72 hours of the onset. These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve. \n   Remarkably, despite this clear evidence, a recent study has shown that many people (more than 40% in the UK) are still not getting the appropriate treatment. And the same study shows that Bell's palsy is more common than previously thought. The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than 7,000 new cases every day. \n   One year ago, as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis, Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity, Facial Palsy UK, which campaigns for better UK services for Bell's palsy and a range of related conditions. \n   \"The information available online about Bell's palsy at the moment is pretty appalling,\" he tells me. \"And there is very poor data because there is not enough research.\" \n \n Bell's palsy sufferers: Most eventually recover from the condition \n \n  The illness, he believes, is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis. \n   But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take. One patient, a professional musician, is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone. Another, a receptionist, is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public. In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph. \n   As one of the UK's leading experts in the treatment of the condition, Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases: \n  They must prescribe a course of prednisolone steroids as early as possible unless there is a good medical reason not to \n  They must not recommend forceful or unsupervised facial exercises as this may lead to abnormal facial movements after recovery \n  Patients who have not recovered fully within six weeks should be referred for further expert advice \n  The affected eye must be treated with eye drops during the day and taped shut at night to prevent serious damage \n Of course the two questions any new Bell's palsy sufferer wants answered are, \"Will I get better?\" and \"How long will it take?\" \n   The good news is that most people make a full recovery - many within a matter of weeks. Something like 70% of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year. Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category. \n   Even without steroids, as my own case shows, most people get back to normal. The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and, by the time I realised how important they were, it was too late. I'm left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them. \n \n \n  I'll never know, because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they don't guarantee it. Estimates suggest that up to 30% of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset. Five per cent of sufferers will experience after-effects that are severe and long lasting and, as a result, face the possibility of serious psychological distress. \n   \"It may be even harder nowadays,\" Mr Nduka says. \"Face is everything - Facebook, Facetime, Skype. We live in a very image-conscious age.\" \n   As for me, well I'm almost back to normal, as you can see from the video. I've been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye. But recovery can continue for up to 18 months and the blink, being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve, is often one of the last things to return. Anyway, I'm not complaining. \n   So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement, advice and good humour. You made a difficult 12 months so much more bearable. And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than they'd like, a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more. \n   Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 1274}, {"date": "2013-10-31 20:17:00", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "The bully in the next bedroom", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? \n   Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. \n   \"The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry,\" says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. \n   Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of an act of sibling aggression in the past 12 months - ranging from theft to serious physical assault. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. \n   Corinna Tucker uses the term \"sibling aggression\" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. \n   So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. \n   \"A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time,\" says Tucker. \"And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention.\" \n   Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. \n   \"My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us,\" she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. \"He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary.\" \n   For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. \n   The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. \n   \"I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'\" recalls Laura. \"And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things.\" \n   Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. \n \n Where is the line between play-fighting and aggression? \n \n  There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. \n   Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. \n   Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. \n   Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. \n   \"From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another,\" says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. \"But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is.\" \n   Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. \n \n Siblings said they were close, even if they bullied each other \n \n  Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. \n   \"If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely,\" says Wolke. \"And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7.\" \n   Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be \"serious and lifelong\". \n   \"We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying,\" she says. \"I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked.\" \n   While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. \n   They should also consider what might be causing the problems. \"There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated,\" she says. \n \n Rough and tumble is an important part of child development \n \n  Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. \n   Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. \"We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict,\" she says. \n   She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as \"very strong\" and her older brother as a \"gentleman\". \n   But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents.

Some are facing the long wait for a heart transplant and are being kept alive by the rhythmic beating of a mechanical heart. \n   Sam Wallace's bed is surrounded by balloons, toys and other reminders of home. His grandmother, Viv Green, says the music has a transformative effect. \n   \"Oh, Sammy loves music, he has always loved music. \n   \"It just makes him happy. He will sing and dance.

Can a rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star actually help patients? \n   A team at the hospital and University of Roehampton tried to find out. \n   Thirty-seven children were played songs - including Five Little Ducks, See-Saw Marjorie Daw and Hush-a-Bye Baby - while nurses monitored their heart rates and assessed their pain levels. \n   The impact of the music was compared with storytelling or just leaving a child alone. \n \n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The results, published in the journal Psychology of Music , showed only music was reducing pain, slowing heart rates and improving the children's moods. \n   \"It varies from child to child. Not every child wants to have music but for those that opt to have music I think it's very important for them,\" said Dr Pickett. \n   He added: \"I think the most rewarding thing is if you are working with a child that is very distressed, a little one, and you go in, play some live calming, quiet music and watch the child go to sleep, that is great, it's the best reward.\" \n   One of the study's authors, David Hargreaves, of Roehampton University, is a jazz pianist as well as professor of music psychology. \n   As he sits playing a jazz interpretation of My Funny Valentine, he says the piece calms him down and makes him happy. \n   He says that kind of connection with music is shared even by young children: \"Lullabies are something that children are familiar with. They're intended by parents to be used with their children to create relaxation and remove tension.\" \n   But is this just providing some evidence for what a lot of parents have realised for a long time, that singing to their children can soothe them? \n   The earliest records of lullabies can be traced to Babylonian times. \n \n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n    \n   \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Babylonian lullaby: Little baby in the dark house \n\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n \n\n\n  \"I think it goes a bit further,\" he said. \n   \"We are beginning to work out what aspects of the music affects what aspects of the physical and psychological response. \n   \"Music has an effect on our thinking, our social behaviour, our emotions and our physical responses of course.

There is a part which processes sound patterns in the cortex and then there's a more ancient part of the brain which is responsible for the emotional responses to music.\" \n   It is a process that he says begins in the womb, so he was not surprised that children can benefit from music: \"What I think is happening here is that the emotional part of the brain is being stimulated by the music more so than the reading, and this is decreasing the arousal level of the children, and that in turn is affecting their pain response levels.\" \n   The academic team admit their research is at an early stage, but are convinced music could end up playing a much bigger role in hospitals.", "topics": [], "author": "James Gallagher", "wordCount": 710}, {"date": "2013-10-26 12:29:00", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "Do you know the good fat from bad?", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24684386#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "Food retailers and manufacturers have signed a pledge to reduce saturated fat levels in their products \n \n\t\n      As food retailers and manufacturers sign a pledge to cut saturated fat levels in their products, how much do you know about the different types of fat in your diet? \n   Apart from saturated fat, others found naturally and artificially in food are unsaturated fat and trans fats. \n   Not all fat is bad - a little in your diet helps the body absorb certain nutrients. \n   And fat can be a source of energy, also providing essential fatty acids and some vitamins - such as vitamins A and D. \n   So which fats should you be eating more of and which should you look to reduce? \n \n  According to NHS Choices - an online healthcare advice service - cutting down on foods that are high in saturated fat is important as part of a healthy diet. \n \n A balanced diet should contain more unsaturated fat than saturated fat, such as that found it meat pies \n \n  Such foods include, butter, lard, chocolate, cakes, pastries and meat products, including sausages and pies. \n   Most people eat too much saturated fat: around 20% more than the recommended maximum, studies by the British Dietetic Association say. \n   Current Department of Health daily recommendations say the average man should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, while the average woman should eat no more than 20g a day. \n   A diet high in saturated fat can increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (otherwise known as bad cholesterol) in blood over time, increasing the risk of heart disease. \n   But that risk has recently been disputed . \n   Writing in the British Medical Journal, cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra says saturated fat has been \"demonised for decades\" with any link to heart disease not fully supported by scientific evidence. \n   He says the food industry has compensated for lowering saturated fat levels by replacing them with sugar. \n \n\n \n Avocados are a source of unsaturated fat \n \n  Eating a diet of unsaturated fats can help lower bad cholesterol levels in the blood and increase levels of high-density lipoproteins (known as good cholesterol). \n   Saturated fats can be replaced in a balanced diet with these healthier monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are found in many of foods, including: \n  Oily fish, such as salmon, sardines and mackerel \n  Nuts and seeds \n  Sunflower and olive oils \n  Fruit and vegetables, including avocados \n Oily fish provides omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, the richest source of that particular type. \n   Omega-3 oils can help lower blood triglyceride levels, prevent blood from clotting and maintain a regular heart rhythm. \n   The British Heart Foundation says we should aim to eat two portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily. \n   It also recommends a small amount of monounsaturated fats to help maintain healthy cholesterol levels. \n \n\n  The third type of fat that can be found in the diet, is trans fats. \n   Natural trans fats are found at low levels in some foods, including meat and dairy products. \n \n Eating fewer biscuits and cakes can reduce trans fats in a person's diet \n \n  Artificial trans fats are made when oil goes through a process of hydrogenation, known as hydrogenated fat. \n   It can be used for frying. \n   Artificial trans fats can also be found in some processed foods, such as biscuits and cakes, and are sometimes used to give products a longer shelf life. \n   A diet high in trans fats can also lead to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood, but most people in the UK do not eat a lot of trans fats. On average, we eat about half the recommended maximum. \n   Most UK supermarkets have removed hydrogenated vegetable oil from their products. \n   NHS Choices says we eat a lot more saturated fats than trans fats, but recommends that reducing the amount of saturated fat is more important than reducing the amount of trans fats. \n   Sources: Department of Health, British Heart Foundation, NHS Choices and NHS Fat Facts.", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 650}, {"date": "2013-10-25 20:26:00", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "Is tax good for our health?", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24645171#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "text": "A tax on sugary drinks - will it make any difference to Mexico's obesity levels? \n \n      A controversial tax on soft drinks is currently being debated in Mexico's Congress. But can a tax really reduce the nation's waistlines? \n   Sometimes coming top isn't such a good thing. \n   Over a third of Mexican adults are overweight, putting them way up the global league tables for obese nations. \n   A possible cause is found in another of Mexico's dubious honours - being the world's biggest consumer of soft drinks. \n   The health consequences are taking a hefty toll on the country's finances. \n   In 2011, 1.2% of the country's GDP was used to treat obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, which is the same percentage as Canada spent on its entire military. \n   In recent years Mexico's government has tried to combat this epidemic by reducing sugar and fat levels in school breakfasts, and removing processed foods from vending machines in schools. \n   But now the current administration is trying to take a much more controversial step: adding a tax of one peso (equivalent to 8 US cents) onto every litre of soft drink. \n 'Just like any Mexican' \n\t  One man who saw his life come crashing down after the highs of soda is 55-year-old teacher Armando Murillo Salgado. \n   He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and sugary drinks are now strictly off the menu. \n   But it was difficult to see the warning signs as he used to drink them \"just like any Mexican does.\" \n \n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n    \n   \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Can a tax make Mexico healthier? \n\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n \n\n\n  However he is currently in hospital being treated for heart complications related to his diabetes. \n   He says: \"I think 50% of my condition is down to soft drinks - because of the ingredients. You can see on any bottle the kind of stuff that goes into them.\" \n   But Armando is sceptical that higher prices would have stopped him drinking them. \n   \"What you're looking for in soft drinks is the flavour, the taste. I might have stopped for a second to ask myself 'wow, how much?!' - but I would still have bought it.\" \n   Ines Sanchez, a nutritionist at Centro Medico Hospital 20 de Noviembre in Mexico City, where Armando is being treated, agrees that more is needed than a tax. \n   \"We need other strategies to address health problems, before we even get to measures like taxes. It's better to teach healthy eating habits and give people alternatives.\" \n Public health v manufacturers \n\t  The tax is being hotly debated around the country. \n   Those in favour say it is a significant first step, while opponents are certain it will not reduce obesity levels, and feel it is just a way of swelling the government's coffers. \n   Jorge Ramo represents the National Association of Soft Drinks and Carbonated Water Manufacturers (ANPRAC). \n   Not surprisingly, he scorns the idea that a tax would do any good. \n   \"Taxes are never important in beating health problems. The government has to create adequate programmes to improve the health of Mexicans - but not with a tax.\" \n   He argues that soft drinks make up only 5% of the average Mexican's daily calorie intake. \n   But Alejandro Calvillo, director of Consumer Power (Poder del Consumidor), one of the NGOs pushing for the tax to be introduced, points to Mexico's number one spot for global soda consumption -a yearly average of 163 litres per person. \n   \"If you take out the people who don't drink them - about 5% - and those who only drink them once or twice a week, you're left with a percentage of the population who drink 880ml of soft drinks every day.\" \n 'No nutritional value' \n\t  But why tax soft drinks rather than other unhealthy culprits? \n   Kelly Brownell, professor of public policy at Duke University in the US, was the man who introduced the idea of a \"soda tax\" back in 1994. \n   There are a long list of reasons to target sugared beverages first, he told the BBC. \n   \"Sugared drinks have no nutritional value. The caffeine and sugar may be triggering craving and withdrawal, setting up an addictive-like process. \n   \"Finally, the body does not register calories very well when they are delivered in beverages - you do not feel as full.\" \n   He believes such taxes will be routine in a few years, and the wisdom of using them will be taken for granted - much like taxes on tobacco. \n   Mexico isn't the first country to toy with the idea of so-called 'fat taxes'. \n   Hungary, France and Denmark have all introduced taxes on unhealthy comestibles in the past few years. \n   But last year Denmark repealed its tax on food with more than a 2.3% saturated fat content - a fact which many of those who oppose the Mexican bill bring into the debate. \n   \"It failed because people looked for other options,\" says Jorge Ramo. \n   But fat taxes need to be hefty to work, according to a 2012 study published in the British Medical Journal. \n   It showed the benefits only kicked in when taxes increased prices by about 20% - and the proposed Mexican tax amounts to just a 10% price hike. \n 'Not enough' \n\t  Really steep increases are likely to leave consumers frothing at the mouth. \n   Indeed, in the United States - where some states have taxed fizzy drinks - there has been strong opposition to the government interfering with something as personal as diet. \n   But Professor Nicholas Finer, a specialist in obesity medicine at University College Hospital in London, believes that government do have a role to play. \n   Not least because it is so difficult for individuals to lose weight of their own accord. \n   \"Humans have evolved to survive famine, so our brains tend to tell us it's good to eat as much as we can while it's there, in order to survive the periods of food shortage. \n   \"We haven't adapted to our appetites to live in a society with less food shortages. So it makes sense for governments to step in.\" \n   One thing that both those for and against the tax agree on, is that by itself it will not be enough to significantly reduce the obesity epidemic in Mexico. \n   More support is needed, they say, for the health system as a whole and for healthy eating campaigns, especially those targeted at children. \n   And with or without the tax, Mexico has a long way to go before it slips down the global obesity charts.", "topics": [], "author": "Juan Carlos Perez Salazar and Cathy Edwards", "wordCount": 1055}, {"date": "2011-03-13 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "NCAA basketball: Navy women beat American, earn first NCAA tournament bid", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/12/AR2011031206022.html?wprss=rss_sports", "text": "Navy seniors Angela Myers and Cassie Consedine were the first to embrace at center court following a 47-40 victory over American in the Patriot League final Saturday at Alumni Hall.

That instead fell to a trio of freshmen, most notably forwards Jade Geif and Audrey Bauer, whose three-pointer with 4 minutes 29 seconds to play put Navy ahead for good, 42-39.\n \n \nThat shot capped an 8-0 run for Navy, which allowed no field goals and one point over the final 8:44. In erasing a 12-point halftime deficit, the Midshipmen (20-11) limited No. 3 seed American to 10 points and 18 percent shooting after the break in the lowest-scoring Patriot League tournament game of all-time.\n \n \n\"There did seem to be a point in late in that game where it we were just going to win,\" Navy Coach Stefanie Pemper said. \"That's a really special moment I think in sports. Not to take anything away from [the Eagles], but they just were so cold in the second, and you didn't get the sense they were going to heat up. I just thought the spirit of the women on our team was incredible.\"\n \n \nGeif finished with a game-high 16 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 steals and 1 block en route to being named the tournament's most valuable player. The league's rookie of the year shot 7 for 10 and, along with Bauer (seven points, four rebounds, two blocks), was about the only reason the Midshipmen were even remotely within striking distance after a first half in which nothing much went right.\n \n \nFreshman Alix Membreno added 10 points in an unusually lively performance from three-point range. The starting guard had made just 10 three-pointers coming in and only three in 16 Patriot League games before going 3 for 4 on Saturday.\n \n \nGeif, Bauer and Membreno more than made up for forgettable shooting efforts from Myers and Consedine, who combined to go 2 for 16. Myers, who was named to the Patriot League first team, finished with seven points and five assists, none more important than when she drove deep into the lane and passed out to Bauer for the go-ahead three-pointer.\n \n \nConsedine, meantime, missed all eight of her shots but had 10 rebounds while playing with tape around her sore left thumb.\n \n \n\"You think that would bode pretty well for us,\" American Coach Matt Corkery said of keeping Myers and Consedine in check. \"But with Jade, she can always be tough, and they got her a lot of touches. They did a good job of getting her the ball in space and where she could make some things happen with it.\"\n \n \nPlaying their second straight Patriot League title game and fourth overall, the Eagles (22-9) had all the momentum going into halftime after senior forward Liz Leer made consecutive three-pointers for a 30-18 advantage. It appeared at that point American would be heading to its first NCAA tournament.\n \n \nNavy, however, made its move with a 16-2 run to open the second half after failing to score for the final 5:33 before intermission. Membreno's three-pointer triggered the comeback, and by the time Geif made a pair of foul shots, the Midshipmen had taken their first lead, 34-32.\n \n \nSophomore center Stephanie Anya (Holy Cross High) had the only basket for American during that burst, which featured a pair of Membreno three-pointers and six points from Geif. But the Eagles reclaimed the lead, 39-34, shortly thereafter with seven straight points capped by a three-pointer from senior guard Nicole Ryan (team-high 12 points) from the top of the arc before Navy's closing kick.\n \n \n\"I think today's game was like a summary of what happened during the season,\" said Bauer, whose team swept three games from American this season. \"We had our down time and everything, but how we got through was we got through together, and I know everyone is super excited to have the seniors have their last game at Alumni Hall and come out with a win.\"", "topics": [], "author": "Gene Wang", "wordCount": 713}, {"date": "2011-03-12 00:00:00", "domain": "www.washingtonpost.com", "title": "Wade's four early blocks set tone as Miami take Memphis to woodshed", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/12/AR2011031204273.html?wprss=rss_sports", "text": "MIAMI -- In less than a minute, Dwyane Wade set the tone for the Miami Heat.\n \n \n \nWade blocked four shots in a dazzling 55-second span shortly after tipoff, and the Heat wound up rolling past the Memphis Grizzlies 118-85 on Saturday to win their second straight.\n \n \nIt was one of Miami's top defensive displays of the season, holding the Grizzlies to 39 percent shooting and forcing Memphis into missing its final 10 shots of the first half.\n \n \nAnd Wade was the catalyst, with that stretch that started when he blocked Tony Allen's jumper with 7:56 left in the first quarter.

Dan Mavraides threw the inbounds pass to Davis, who caught the ball, dribbled free of a defender and put up a fade-away jumper.\n \n \nThe buzzer sounded while the ball was still in the air, and everyone at Payne Whitney Gymnasium held its collective breath until it slipped through the net. As the Princeton fans stormed the court, the referees looked at the replay, which showed the ball left Davis's hands with two-tenths of a second remaining.\n \n \n\"It felt good, it went in and I fell to the ground,\" Davis said. \"That was the worst decision I've ever made because everybody just jumped on me.\"\n \n \nHarvard got caught on a switch on the play.

Harvard, the nation's oldest university, has produced 10 U.S. presidents, 14 Supreme Court justices and even an astronaut, but no Ivy League men's basketball titles until this season. The Crimson had waited longer than any other Division I team to win its conference title. Now Harvard wanted to go to the NCAA tournament. The Crimson's only trip came in 1946, nine years before the Ivy League was formed.\n \n \nHarvard and Princeton finished tied atop the league standings, and the Ivy League is the only league without a conference tournament. So the teams went to a one-game, winner-take-all playoff.\n \n \nThis was the eighth time the Ivy League needed a playoff to decide its NCAA tournament representative in its 55-year history. The last time the Ivy League held a playoff was in 2002, when three teams - Yale, Princeton and Penn - tied for first place. That year, Penn represented the league.\n \n \nPrinceton is accustomed to being the league's lead horse. The Tigers have won 26 Ivy League titles and gone to 24 NCAA tournaments. But it had been seven years without an appearance. Georgetown Coach John Thompson III, whom Johnson worked for as an assistant with the Hoyas, was the last to lead them to an Ivy League title.\n \n \n\"I love this program,\" said Johnson, a 1997 Princeton graduate who won two Ivy League titles as a player and became the Tigers' coach in 2007. \"To be able to be alongside these young men, it just means everything because that's our standards. . . .

Of course, the Mill being nothing more than a mere rumour ruminator who works for nought but food would know little about taxes (how can you tax half a fish head?). But say if you were to ask about the intricate use of stream of consciousness and how it depicts the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind of the varied characters in Ulysses \u2013 the cartoon, not the novel \u2013 then the Mill would be your only man. Or, say, if you were to ask about which Mr 15% wants to keep the twinkle, twinkle in his little star's eyes by engineering that dream move to a club that he had never heard of, then, once again, the Mill is your only man. Speaking of which. Last summer, Yohan Cabaye tried his best to have a dalliance around the back of the bike shed with a couple of clubs that caught his eye, promising them that if they showed just the slightest shot of ankle, he would be make it the best day of their lives. But OMG no club bit \u2013 or whatever it was Yohan wanted them to do - and Newcastle United , after some relationship crisis talks, took him back through a veil of pain and tears. Since then, the pair have been snapped out in public holding hands, window shopping in Jesmond and even (ooooooooooooh!) looking at rings in Davidsons. But behind the scenes it is a very different story. The relationship has flared up and friends of the couple describe the atmosphere around them as \"fraught\" and \"tense\". Yohan wants out and Roma are set to offer him an exit route. Should La Maggica fail to tempt Yohan to the Eternal City, via bags of good food and bags of cash, they will turn their attentions to the Tottenham Hotspur duo of Sandro and Lewis Holtby. Speaking of the Totts, after Lord Sugar's sour attack on pimpled teenage nerd Andr\u00e9 Villas Boas ( \"clueless no tactics no plan,\" bodyslammed the Lord Twitter , before performing a delayed vertical suplex and finishing off the Portugeezer with the Cobra Clutch ), the Spurs manager has taken to his room with a pen and paper to work out exactly where his side are going wrong this season. His eureka (!) moment came when he looked in the goals scored column and realised that even Fulham had found the back of the net more than his side this season. Oh the shame, the shame! To combat this then he is going to try get his hands on a 21-year-old central midfielder from Barcelona by the name of Sergi Roberto. Hmmm, maybe the Shugster has a point. Elsewhere, financial fair play's Monaco have so much money they could eat steak and lobster and salad (their own choice of dressing, naturally) and jelly and ice-cream all in a single meal every day of the week, every day of the month, every day of the year. They also have so much money they could buy Barcelona's entire first-team squad, triple their wages, buy all of the lads a shiny, new Audi and stick them all in the reserves, never to be seen or heard of again. But their eyes are elsewhere. Their eyes are on the West Midlands. Their eyes are on the The Hawthorns. Their eyes are on \u00a3850-a-week's Saido Berahino. The youngster has been making the sort of waves that would make Carlos Burle hurl in terror and the sort of waves that have led to whispers in dressing-rooms around the country that Berahino might be making Roy Hodgson's next squad . All this excitement has pricked the principality's ears and they want in on the ground floor. But they are not the only ones, Arsenal and Everton are sniffing around him too. Which leads the Mill onto the final rumour of the day. Huzzah! Alto Para\u00edso de Goi\u00e1s is known for three things; new age tourism, sightings of flying saucers and Porto's Fernando. Everton's Roberto Mart\u00ednez has no interest in the first two (that the Mill knows of anyway) but he most certainly does in rummaging around bargain basements which is where the third one comes into play. Fernando's contract is coming to end this coming summer and the Brazilian is as perky as the average teenage goth about the thought of putting a Porto pen to Porto paper and signing a new Porto deal. But Mart\u00ednez ain't the only one casting an eye on the one who wants to be castaway, so too are cabal of Italian clubs from Juventus to Napoli to Internazionale.

Photograph: CARL COURT/AFP/Getty Images \n\n \n\n\n  \n    \n\t It does not take an oracle to predict that Jackson Irvine has a big future for the Socceroos. \n \u00a0Despite only making a brief appearance against Canada in his recent national team debut, the 20-year-old is already being touted as a potential inclusion for the World Cup squad. And while Irvine would rather live in the moment \u2013 indeed he is still evidently delighted when discussing his first cap \u2013 the Celtic midfielder will no doubt spend the rest of his loan at Kilmarnock trying to earn that ticket to Brazil. \n \u201cMy debut was obviously pretty special,\u201d Irvine recalls in a smooth Australian accent that nevertheless betrays his time in Scotland. \u201cEvery kid in Australia growing up dreams of playing for the Socceroos, and myself, well \u2013 I was in Sydney in 2005 against Uruguay, I was in Germany in 2006 for the World Cup. So it was a dream come true to be playing with some of the guys I grew up idolising.\u201d \n Irvine replaced Mile Jedinak in the 83rd minute as the Socceroos recorded a comfortable victory over the Canadians, in a great end to a week spent with the stars of Australian football. \u201cThese guys are such big names and obviously they have all had extremely distinguished careers,\u201d the former Frankston Pines player confesses, \u201cbut at the end of the day they are just blokes from Australia who want to play football for their country. Everyone was really great to me, and they are all there for the same reason \u2013 we want to represent Australia at the highest level.\u201d \n Fast-forward four days however and Irvine had gone from national team glamour to reality at Kilmarnock, where his club side were winless from their first nine Scottish Premier League clashes. Yet buoyed by his Socceroos debut, Irvine capped his incredible week with a spectacular curling effort from outside the box to seal a win against Ross County. \n \u201cIt was a bit off the cuff really,\u201d the Celtic loanee admits. \u201cIt may have looked like something off the training ground, but it was just a spur of the moment thing. Nine times out of 10 you\u2019ll probably hit those into row Z, but I was lucky enough that it went into the top corner.\u201d \n Irvine has been at Kilmarnock since August , impressing both as a centre-back and in midfield. His long-term ambitions still lie with the Bhoys though, a club he joined after trialling there at the end of 2009. \n \u201cMy whole experience with Celtic has been really good,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cI played in the youth team for about three years, and then over the last 12 months I\u2019ve started to get involved with the first team \u2013 playing in friendlies and I also made my competitive debut. It\u2019s a very tough team to break into, being in the Champions League and with the expectation of winning the SPL every year, but overall I am really enjoying my time there.\u201d \n One particular highlight was a friendly against Liverpool this pre-season, with the midfielder earning rave reviews after dominating the Merseyside opposition in a man-of-the-match performance. \n \u201cIt was pretty surreal,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cWe had a depleted squad so it was a bit of a fringe first team that played, and I was fortunate enough to start. It was a tremendous experience, we had a massive crowd in Dublin, playing against some of the best players in the world in a very accomplished Premier League team.\u201d \n The lone disappointment for Irvine was his failure to collect Steven Gerrard\u2019s shirt post-match, despite media reports to the contrary . \u201cThere were a lot of pictures taken in the exact moment when I was asking for Gerrard\u2019s shirt,\u201d the Australian explains, \u201cbut he\u2019d already promised it to someone else.\u201d \n Irvine might have another chance to swap shirts with the Liverpool captain sooner rather than later, with a potential match-up in Brazil not out of the question. Despite having just the solitary cap from his substitute outing against Canada, Irvine has already been touted as a potential World Cup bolter, and is in the squad of at least one prominent journalist . \n While the 20-year-old refuses to be drawn on speculation, he admits the chance to play at the World Cup would be a dream come true. \n \u201cTo play for the Socceroos in Brazil would be everything, it\u2019s what you play this game for \u2013 every young player around the world strives for that opportunity,\u201d Irvine comments. \u201cIf I could manage to get myself in that squad it would be an absolute dream. It\u2019s something I can barely even comprehend.\u201d \n The Melbourne native may even find himself jetting to Brazil twice over the coming years, with the combative midfielder eligible for the U23 side that, qualification permitting, will head to Rio de Janeiro in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m still Olyroos age, and we\u2019ve got the Olympics coming up in a few years, so there are plenty of national team opportunities,\u201d he added. \u201cBut obviously you want to take yourself to the highest level, and I\u2019d love to stay involved with the Socceroos, especially looking towards the Asian Cup.\u201d \n A composed, articulate and entertaining interviewee, it\u2019s immediately clear why Irvine is regarded as a player with leadership potential. It is therefore no surprise that he has captained the Young Socceroos on several occasions and regularly wore the armband for Celtic youth and reserve teams.

Photograph: QUENTIN JONES/AAPIMAGE \n\n \n\n\n  \n    \n\t The Western Sydney Wanderers are undoubtedly a phenomenal sporting story, and they continue to create firsts in the club\u2019s short history. Tomi Juric\u2019s double against Adelaide United on Friday night ensured the Wanderers collected their first ever come-from-behind victory in the A-League. Coach Tony Popovic admitted his surprise when he was told of yet another mini milestone, but it is an even more surprising first that is worth talking about. Before Friday, Western Sydney Wanderers had never won an A-League match without Youssouf Hersi. So what is it about Hersi that is so important to how the Wanderers play? \n The Numbers \n In Hersi\u2019s last 20 matches for the club, the Wanderers have won 18 times and drawn twice, and they have never won in his absence. Amazingly, last season, Western Sydney won 17 straight games in which Hersi played. His five goals and 10 assists so far for the club has helped contribute to their incredible run to win the Premiers\u2019 Plate. \n But, up until Friday night, their failure to win without their Dutch winger was no coincidence. His combination with right full-back Jerome Polenz is one of the A-League\u2019s best, and the Wanderers are not afraid to use it. So much is their right-sided bias in attack, that last season 65.6% of the Wanderers\u2019 crosses came from the right . \n Hersi\u2019s importance to the system can be put down to his phenomenal energy. Without the ball, Hersi is a vital cog in Western Sydney\u2019s high press. Not only applying pressure high up the pitch, Hersi also contributes defensively in deeper areas, dropping back to form an almost impenetrable 4-4-2 defensive block. In attack, his intelligent movement and quick acceleration means he is constantly the first outlet for a pass in a counter attack \u2013 with his team purposely picking him out wide on the right. The width Hersi provides on the right is essential to the Wanderers\u2019 attack, allowing Mark Bridge, their top scorer last season, to come inside to finish off counter attacking moves.\u00a0 \n \n\t\t Hersi\u2019s five goals and 10 assists, as well as winning three penalties, makes him essential to the way Western Sydney play. Photograph: /Guardian In his absence, Tony Popovic has struggled to find a suitable replacement that can combine such enthusiasm in defence and probity on the right hand side of attack. Popovic has tried both Labinot Haliti and Kwabena Appiah-Kubi, but\u00a0 neither has been able to provide a similar attacking threat \u00a0\u2013 so much so, that Western Sydney only scored 0.17 goals per game when Hersi did not feature, compared to 1.8 per game when he did (prior to Friday night).\u00a0 \n Against Adelaide United \n \n\t\t Analysis of Western Sydney Wanderers' right hand side. Photograph: /Guardian Hersi is clearly very difficult to fully replace, but against Adelaide, Popovic\u2019s decision to start Brendon Santalab and later replace him with Tahj Minniecon allowed Western Sydney to almost match both the defensive and offensive qualities that Hersi offers. Both players defended admirably, but their attacking movements to the right helped the Wanderers maintain width in attack. \n Whilst Santalab lacked the guile that Hersi offers with the ball at his feet, his work rate was exceptional as he pulled wide in attack. As shown in the graphic above, Santalab most frequently received the ball off an immediate switch of play from Aaron Mooy. Receiving the ball almost on the sideline, Santalab was able to dribble directly toward Adelaide\u2019s left-back Michael Zullo, whilst Polenz overlapped to create a 2 v 1 situation on the right. \n Santalab looked to create 2 v 1s, but lacked the confidence to repeatedly take on his man, instead playing a pass inside to support or to Polenz. But Minniecon\u2019s introduction with half an hour to go added another spark to the Wanderers\u2019 right-sided attack. By coupling similar movements (drifting wide to receive the ball, before attempting to isolate Michael Zullo) with his pace and technical skills, Minniecon was pivotal to the comeback win. \n On two occasions, after picking the ball up on the right thanks to two long-range passes from Mooy, Minniecon demonstrated similar attacking variety to Hersi. Firstly, in the 75th minute, Minniecon received possession on the sideline and ran directly at Zullo before whipping in an inch perfect cross to Bridge in the box. Then, just 45 seconds later, he again received the ball wide on the right. The pass from Mooy allowed Minniecon to run at Zullo, cutting inside to get away a dangerous shot on target. \n In Minniecon, Western Sydney might have found themselves best replacement yet for Hersi. With Santalab providing 60 minutes of hard work, Minniecon was able to intelligently find himself in space on the right and combine that with unpredictability with the ball at his feet. Ideally for the Wanderers, Hersi will shake off his foot injury and remain fit regularly, but should he be unavailable, they now have a suitable foil in Santalab and Minniecon. And also a monkey off their back.", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 829}, {"date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Lucas Neill on course to survive Socceroos\u2019 cut", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/334cfd8c/sc/38/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A50Clucas0Eneill0Eon0Ecourse0Eto0Esurvive0Esocceroos0Ecut/story01.htm", "text": "Socceroos skipper Lucas Neill at a team training session.

But whether Neill keeps the captaincy, and even his starting central defensive post, remains to be seen. \n Some pundits expect Postecoglou to anoint Tim Cahill as the new captain in the first step towards regeneration of the Socceroos. But the former Melbourne Victory coach has also pledged to make considered decisions and respect the Socceroos' older guard as he starts his reign. \n Postecoglou replaced Holger Osieck as coach, the German sacked after consecutive 6-0 away defeats to Brazil and France last month. \n Postecoglou, the first Australian coach of the Socceroos since Frank Farina's tenure ended in 2005, will name a 23-strong squad. But he is likely to delay crucial decisions until he gathers the squad at a week-long training camp leading into the Sydney friendly. \n Much interest for the Costa Rica game will also centre on the battle for the starting goalkeeper role between evergreen Mark Schwarzer and the emerging 25-year-old Mitch Langerak. \n Schwarzer was overlooked for the routs against Brazil and France, given his continued lack of game time for English Premier League powerhouse Chelsea. Langerak, the Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper, could herald wider generational change for next year's World Cup in Brazil if given the first-choice role ahead of the veteran Schwarzer. \n But Langerak doesn't expect his previous relationship with Postecoglou at Australian under-20 level to work in his favour. \n \"Ange has got his own ideas and his own players who he thinks he can work with and who he thinks he can develop,\" Langerak told the fourfourtwo magazine. \"It will be interesting to see which direction he takes. \n \"We're all excited; we're all looking forward to it. \n \"It's a clean slate for everybody.

Celtic head to the Amsterdam ArenA for a fixture they must realistically take at least a point from if they are to progress from Group H. Neil Lennon's men defeated Ajax 2-1 in Glasgow a fortnight ago . Celtic will later host Milan and take on Barcelona in the Camp Nou to complete their group fixtures with Strachan confident about the Scottish champions' prospects. \"I think Celtic can win on Wednesday and I think they can beat AC Milan,\" the Scotland manager said. \"That's not just hoping; I definitely think they can beat them. \"They're a better team than Ajax at this moment. The Ajax team will develop; they look like a youth team \u2013 I don't think anybody has had a shave in that team. When you look at them and the Juventus team Celtic played last season, they were men. \"The Ajax team will develop in the next nine months, a year, into an exceptional team again. Ajax's problem, like most clubs, is they keep improving players then somebody buys them. \"At the moment I think Celtic have the strength and the knowhow to definitely get a result there, because Ajax are not in the best of form just now. And they can definitely beat AC Milan.\" Strachan offered his thoughts as he named his Scotland squad for the upcoming friendlies against the United States and Norway. Three Celtic players \u2013 James Forrest, Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew \u2013 are in that party. \"There's absolutely no doubt about it, Celtic's experience in the Champions League has helped Scottish international football,\" Strachan said. \"Thinking back five or six years ago when Rangers were on a good run and got to the Uefa Cup final, that added to the Scotland squad as well. \"Apart from Celtic, the players don't have European football, which is a pity. I'm sure if they had it, they would definitely get better. \"It's not an arrogance, it's a confidence you feel. When you might have thought: 'Am I good enough?' It becomes: 'Yes, I am good enough.' \"I would love to get players with that experience staying in Europe longer. How to deal with it, things like travelling all the time and getting used to having less training sessions.\" Strachan also explained how he will wait until Darren Fletcher is back in Manchester United's first team before re-selecting him for the international stage. Fletcher, the Scotland captain, has played only 13 matches since December 2011 as he battles a serious bowel condition. The midfielder did feature, though, for United's under-21 team last week and is closing in on a first-team comeback. \"I think we just leave him,\" said Strachan. \"The thing I'm looking for is his first game with the United first team and that will signal to us that then we come on board.\"", "topics": [], "author": "Ewan Murray", "wordCount": 500}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Neven Subotic happy to go extra mile for Borussia Dortmund and Klopp", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/334c4d2b/sc/13/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A40Cborussia0Edortmund0Eneven0Esubotic0Echampions0Eleague/story01.htm", "text": "Borussia Dortmund's Neven Subotic, right, battles for possession with Mesut \u00d6zil during the Champions League win at Arsenal. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\n \n  \n\t  Neven Subotic's journey from Bosnia war refugee and struggling teen wannabe in the United States to Borussia Dortmund and the Champions League appears to blur the lines of reality. The 24-year-old Serbia defender has already crammed a lot in but it is where he intends to go next that he hopes will provide the fantasy. The heartbreak of the Champions League final defeat to Bayern Munich at Wembley last season might never leave him. \"I still haven't watched the game in full,\" he says. \"I know how it turns out and it is not that exciting.\" The delivery is deadpan. The recovery is under way. Dortmund are playing well and they are getting results, most recently the 6-1 battering of Stuttgart on Friday. They lurk on Bayern's shoulder in the Bundesliga while the 2-1 win at Arsenal in the Champions League two weeks ago has put them in good heart for thereturn on Wednesday night. Win at the Westfalenstadion and Dortmund would take a significant step towards the last 16 and the broader goal of establishing themselves among Europe's elite. They are not there yet, Subotic says, despite their eye-catching achievements over the past three seasons, the headline items of which have been the Bundesliga title in 2011, the league and cup double in 2012 and that wild ride to the Champions League final last time out. The foundations are in place. A young team have grown together and, listening to Subotic, it is clear that a deep bond has formed between the players, the manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp , and the rocking home crowd. There have been high-profile departures yet the team's core has remained intact while, with an average of 25, the players' prime years appear to lie ahead. Dortmund, on the brink of bankruptcy in 2005, have risen to the big time and consistency can now lever them to the next level. The possibilities are tantalising. \"We have grown and so have our expectations,\" Subotic says. \"I don't think we are at the point where if we don't win the national title, it is a terrible season. We have some time until that \u2013 first, we have to buy the big players for \u20ac60m or \u20ac100m. \"But we are on the way to establishing ourselves. We always have to be at the top to say we are a top team and we've been very close to it over the last three years. We now want to establish that over the next few years and continue to grow. \"I was born in 1988, I'm 25 at the end of this year and I'm in the older half of the team. If you think about the Milans and the Inters, where you are 30 and maybe in the older half of the team, it is definitely something different and special.\" Subotic dreams big because he knows from experience that anything is possible. Born in Banja Luka in what was Yugoslavia and is now Bosnia-Herzegovina, he and his family fled to Schomberg in Germany just before the Bosnian civil war began in March 1992. His father, Zeljko, who played for Maribor in what is now Slovenia, gave up the game to work as a labourer while his mother cleaned houses and worked in old people's homes. \"For any Bosnian Serb coming to Germany this is the only type of work you will get as an illegal immigrant,\" Subotic says. \"I just saw my parents work a lot of hours to help their family back in Bosnia.\" They moved again in 1999 after the expiry of their residence visa in Germany and rather than be deported to Bosnia-Herzegovina, they followed an immigration programme that set them up in the United States, initially in Salt Lake City. After a year, and because of the promise that his sister, Natalija, had shown at tennis, they relocated to Florida so that she could enrol at Nick Bollettieri's academy. Subotic pursued his football, training in the local park, either alone or with Zeljko, and he struggled to find a team. The US system contained rather large cracks and Subotic looked likely to fall through them. \"It is a joke,\" he says. \"You've got one of the kids, who probably doesn't play but his dad ends up being the coach, because nobody wants to coach, and so the kid plays. The system is very leisurely.\" His break came after he asked to join in a game at the park; the team's coach turned out to be an assistant for the United States Under-17s. A trial followed and Subotic was accepted on to the national team's residency programme in Bradenton, Florida, the city in which he lived. Things started to happen. Playing for the Under-17s in the Netherlands he came to the attention of a British agent, Steve Kelly, who got him a trial at Mainz in 2006. The manager was Klopp. Subotic signed and when Klopp moved to Dortmund in 2008, he followed. \"Back in the US, I would never dream about playing for any kind of club in Germany because it was so far-fetched,\" Subotic says. \"I had a lot of luck.\" Klopp has been the game-changer for him and Dortmund. Subotic talks of the manager's passion, personable nature and tactical acumen, and it all adds up to a guy that the players want to go the extra mile for. Klopp's basic requirement is a ferocious work ethic that provides the platform for technical quality. \"We were one of the first teams to say that we wanted to cover more kilometres than the opponents and work on this pressing game but on a very offensive basis,\" Subotic says. \"He wants us to do our job, plus five or 10% more to really get there. We want to do more than close the opponents down. We want to close them down, get the ball and fight for it. \"Stats are very important to him. We never want to run less than the opponent and it's not just more than them, but as much as we can to dominate. As soon as we lose the ball, we are back behind it so the opponent has to play against 10 players \u2013 not five because the other five are still at the front and walking back.\" Klopp has performed the rare trick of identifying young players with huge potential and developing them in a creative and harmonious environment. The products have been loyalty, spirit and an ultra-competitive mentality. \"The core has remained the same for five years and the team has grown together, which is what makes it special,\" Subotic says. \"It's very unique nowadays, in a game where you have players who are here one minute and then, in the winter, they are loaned out. I can look at almost anyone in the team and recount 30 times where he saved my butt or I saved his butt.\" Subotic sounds American and if he had pursued his international career with the USA he would be bound for the World Cup finals. Ditto, Bosnia-Herzegovina, who have also qualified. \"But my parents are Serbian,\" he says, \" \u2026 and all my family are Serbian. With a large chunk of them living in the Serbian part of Bosnia, it was the only real option. It was a step back to my roots.\" Serbia have not qualified and so next summer promises a lull. Subotic has plenty on his mind before then.", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 1240}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Walcott may return at Old Trafford", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/334c1eac/sc/13/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A40Ctheo0Ewalcott0Earsenal0Emanchester0Eunited/story01.htm", "text": "Theo Walcott is stepping up his training routine at London Colney with a view to playing at Old Trafford.

Walcott has been absent from the first team at the Emirates Stadium since requiring minor surgery, undertaken in Germany, on a stomach problem in September. The player had carried the complaint, the problem a result of wear and tear, before feeling it more acutely in the warmup to a league game against Stoke City. The operation and recovery ruled him out of England's past two World Cup qualifiers and 10 club games across three competitions. That period was prolonged after a minor setback in his rehabilitation but, although Walcott will miss an 11th fixture when his club-mates play at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday in their Champions League group game at the Westfalenstadion, the 24-year-old is stepping up his training routine back at London Colney with a view to playing some part at Old Trafford. His involvement would add to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's attacking options for that game, even if the Frenchman must make do for now with a patched-up squad for Wednesday's game in Dortmund. Neither Jack Wilshere nor Kieran Gibbs is expected to travel to Germany. The England midfielder turned his left ankle in training last Thursday and sat out the 2-0 victory over Liverpool that established Arsenal's five-point lead at the top of the Premier League and is unlikely to be fit in time for what has become a critical European game given Dortmund's victory in London last month. Gibbs was replaced near the end of the win over Liverpool after suffering a calf strain but hopes to be fit for the United fixture. Nacho Monreal is expected to deputise. Arsenal top Group F despite that defeat by Dortmund, courtesy of Robert Lewandowski's late winner, but are still also to visit Napoli, meaning that some kind of reward from the trip to last season's beaten finalists is imperative. \"I thought we played well enough to get something from the home game,\" Aaron Ramsey told the club's website. \"The group is wide open again. It is going to be tough, but we are still confident we can qualify. We have been to Dortmund in the past and drew there after conceding a late goal.

Defeat CSKA Moscow at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday evening and the world's richest club are all but certain to reach the Champions League knockout stage for the first time. Five years after the sheikh made City the billionaires in blue the failures of the past two years will be forgotten if Manuel Pellegrini's side win, with only the unlikely scenario of a thus far pointless Viktoria Plzen winning all of their last three games able to stop them. A confluence of factors cost Roberto Mancini the post taken up by Pellegrini, though finishing bottom of the group in last season's competition was a defining one. The corollary of this meant the chief consideration when hiring Pellegrini was a Champions League CV that reads reaching a semi-final and two quarter-finals (when in charge at Villarreal and M\u00e1laga). Pellegrini says of how three points against Leonid Slutsky's side would provide a major shift at his club: \"For Manchester City it is a very great achievement. We all know what happened the last two years; they couldn't go to the round of 16. For a club that is trying to grow every day to go to the next round is very important. \"It is not easy to talk about what can happen in the future. We have a very good squad and the minimum thing this squad needs is to qualify for the round of 16. Afterwards in two-leg play-offs anything can happen. We will try to do the first step and then to continue in February. Our only target is to qualify.\" Pablo Zabaleta, the right-back who was signed the day before Sheikh Mansour planted Abu Dhabi's flag in the blue zone of Manchester, said: \"In last four, five years we have improved incredibly. The owners have spent a lot of money to make us one of the best teams in Europe. We know it takes time. We won the FA Cup, we won the Premier League, but the Champions League is different. You play against the best teams and it has not been easy. But now we are very confident and it is time for us to take a step forward. We are still improving as a team and hopefully in the next few years, we can be one of the best clubs in Europe. \"I think we have a great chance to go through to the next stage if we can win. We don't expect an easy game because we know they have some very good individual players, especially in front, they are good in counterattack. \"It is true we look at the last two seasons and our performance in the Champions League was really poor and all the players are really focused to try to improve our performance in the competitions. Winning will be a step forward to try to qualify for the next round.\" City enter this game on a roll having trounced Norwich City 7-0 at home on Saturday. The performance was Pellegrini's team in the same mode that took apart Manchester United 4-1 earlier this season and a view is forming that City could be on the verge of becoming a consistent scoring machine that takes all-comers apart. \"Yes I think it was a great result,\" said Zabaleta of the win over Chris Hughton's struggling Norwich. \"Seven-nil for every team is great, especially for us because we had a very difficult week after the game we lost against Chelsea [2-1] in the last minute. \"It was really hard but then I think we responded really well, winning at Newcastle in the Capital One Cup [2-0] and now it is time to think about this competition. We have a great chance to win. Hopefully we can do a great game and get the three points which are very important to us.\" Yet a glance at City's record in the campaign shows a five-game unbeaten run (which includes a draw) in August and September the closest they have come to the consistency required to win a trophy. In the game a fortnight ago in Moscow, City conceded first, after 32 minutes, when Zoran Tosic scored, before two quick Sergio Ag\u00fcero strikes before half-time sealed what could prove a crucial win. Asked where CSKA might threaten at the Etihad, Pellegrini said: \"Not only is [Keisuke] Honda a good player, he played also in Germany, but I think CSKA has a lot of good players. We played a very close game in Russia and I suppose it will be the same thing.\" Pellegrini confirmed that \u00c1lvaro Negredo was replaced at half-time against Norwich only to rest him but City will again be without their captain Vincent Kompany and Stevan Jovetic because of injury. \"Alvaro is OK, he doesn't have any problem.

Although their domestic form has improved, with seven points and 10 goals in three games since they were beaten at Old Trafford a fortnight ago, Sociedad will start as rank outsiders on Tuesday. They are yet to collect a point in Group A and know another defeat could even end their hopes of grabbing a Europa League consolation prize by finishing third.

Photograph: Alessandro Di Marco/EPA \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\n \n  \n\t  Real Madrid 's coach Carlo Ancelotti has warned his players to drop their egos and get back to basics, starting with Tuesday's Champions League game at Juventus , after a \"disastrous\" defensive performance in a 3-2 win at Rayo Vallecano. Madrid's defence seemed to implode when they conceded two penalties in two second-half minutes on Saturday. First Pepe conceded a spot kick in the 53rd minute, then an undisciplined tackle from Marcelo allowed Rayo to claw their way back into the game in the 55th minute. Rayo's midfielder Jonathan Viera kept his cool and scored both penalties Ancelotti has warned his players of the need to change their attitudes with the next round beckoning. \"We're attacking very well, but we're allowing too many goals,\" he said. \"It's an important game for Juventus but for us it's an opportunity to qualify for the next stage. The sooner we do that, the better for us.\" A Madrid victory would ensure progress to the knockout stage, while a draw will also be enough if Galatasaray do not lose at Copenhagen. Madrid's goalkeeper Diego L\u00f3pez should give way to Iker Casillas despite an extraordinary performance at Rayo, while Rapha\u00ebl Varane returns to the centre of defence to replace either Pepe or Sergio Ramos. Midfielder Xabi Alonso is also expected to play in the Champions League for the first time this season. Juventus are counting on their local support and impressive home record against Madrid. The new Juventus Stadium has proved somewhat of a fortress in the Champions League with Bayern Munich the only team to emerge victorious in Turin. In their old stadium, Juventus had lost only twice in the competition in 10 years. \"We need to make our home advantage count because, apart from determination and the right tactics, the atmosphere will be important,\" their coach, Antonio Conte, said. \"I'm expecting our fans to provide a red-hot atmosphere, not only when the game is going our way but also when the game isn't going our way. They need to push the players to overcome a hurdle, a very high one at that.\" Madrid have not won at Juventus since 1961-62. Since then, Juventus have racked up five straight wins over their Spanish rivals. Carlos Tevez has started well for Juventus with six league goals this season, but goals have been a lot tougher to come by in the Champions League. Tevez's last goal in Europe's premier competition came in April 2009, when he played for Manchester United. \"Has it really been that long since my last Champions League goal?\" Tevez asked when presented with the fact on Monday. \"If I haven't scored for four years, then let's hope that changes tomorrow.\" Juventus certainly needs the Argentinian to find the net as a defeat could all but end their chances of qualifying for the next stage. Juventus have just two points from three games after losing 2-1 at Madrid. \"We've got to win all three [games remaining],\" Tevez said. \"This game is like a final and we've got to play it like that.\"", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 516}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "CSKA hit out at 'overreaction' to Tour\u00e9 racist abuse incident", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/334c005b/sc/13/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A40Cmanchester0Ecity0Ecska0Emoscow0Eyaya0Etoure/story01.htm", "text": "Manchester City's Yaya Tour\u00e9, left, shares a joke with David Silva as they prepare for their Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow.

Tour\u00e9 suffered monkey chants during Manchester City's 2-1 win at CSKA in a Champions League group game a fortnight ago . Although the Russian club initially denied that Tour\u00e9 had been the subject of the abuse, Uefa has ruled that a section of their ground should be closed for their next home match in the competition, against Bayern Munich. During a press conference in which CSKA tried to keep questions away from the issue, Slutsky was finally moved to make a statement regarding the incident. \"It is normal we are against racism in our team,\" he said. \"We have black players and we give them support. We did not hear any racist chants [so] it is difficult to comment. \"The club is categorically against racism but we think the situation has been very exaggerated and there was an overreaction. We have received our punishment \u2013 it was up to Uefa to impose it.\" Although there was no confirmation that CSKA will not appeal against the verdict, Slutsky indicated the club will abide by the ruling. \"That is a question for the bosses in our club \u2013 I do not deal with appeals,\" he said. \"The sooner we finish [speaking about it the better].\" Although Slutsky offered no apology the CSKA captain, Sergei Ignashevich, did so. But after first stating only that he was sorry some fans would not be able to attend the Bayern game. \"We are very sorry some of the fans won't be at this game but at the moment we are thinking about the [City] game,\" he said. When pressed if he was apologetic over the abuse Tour\u00e9 suffered, Ignashevich said: \"We are sorry that such unpleasant incident took place.\" When Slutsky was asked how bad it would be if there were a repeat during Tuesday's match at the Etihad Stadium, the club's media officer intervened, saying: \"Let's wait for them to repeat it and then feel sorry for that.\" Manuel Pellegrini earlier warned the CSKA fans that there should be no repeat and that they should remember the 2018 World Cup is being held in their country. In light of CSKA's denial that Tour\u00e9 had been subjected to the chants, the City manager was asked how relations were between the two clubs. \"I don't know about the relations of both clubs,\" he said. \"The fans of CSKA made an important mistake. The club, I don't know why they denied at the beginning or what their reaction is now but Uefa acted and gave them the punishment they deserve. I hope we can leave it in the past and [the same] for Russian fans because they have a World Cup in their country.\" Pellegerini will not say anything special to Tour\u00e9 before the game. \"I think Yaya is an experienced player,\" he said. \"What happened in Russia, maybe he can't forget but tomorrow is a special match for him, not because of that but because Manchester City can go to the next stage of the Champions League . I think he will only be thinking about football.\" The City defender Pablo Zabaleta said: \"What happened in Moscow was really hard for Yaya. We are all behind him and any time we see something like that we try to help the players. \"Hopefully Uefa is always on it. As players we can do nothing; we just need to give a massive support to the black players when they have some problems like that. Let me talk about football, that is the most important thing.\" Is the right-back concerned there may be a repeat on Tuesday evening? \"I don't know. As I said before, I don't want to talk too much about racist chants or problems because I think we need to be more focused on football. That is the most important thing. And let Uefa take decisions about it.\" Pellegrini confirmed that Joe Hart will again be dropped for Costel Pantilimon but the manger does not believe his decision has affected the England goalkeeper's confidence. \"No, I think Joe reacted very well. He is a professional player,\" he said. \"For him, it is also a good thing to have a rest after playing so many matches. He is working without any problem, supporting Costel Pantilimon. \"Nobody wants to be out but he thinks it will be useful for him.\"", "topics": [], "author": "Jamie Jackson", "wordCount": 766}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "'Racist abuse of Yaya Tour\u00e9 is a smokescreen, real problem is at home'", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/334bc866/sc/1/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A40Cracist0Eabuse0Eyaya0Etoure0Ejohn0Ebarnes/story01.htm", "text": "Manchester City's Yaya Tour\u00e9, who was subjected to racial abuse by CSKA Moscow fans a fortnight ago, prepares for the return fixture. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\n \n  \n\t  I'm not interested in what happened to Yaya Tour\u00e9 at CSKA Moscow \u2013 as far as I'm concerned their supporters can abuse who they want because, for me, what happened in Russia is the tip of a wider issue and, quite frankly, something of a smokescreen. For instance, how many black coaches are there in this country? Very few, yet all we're focusing on is CSKA Moscow , and the more we push for clubs like them to get banned or have their stadiums shut down the more we don't need to look at what is going on here. The truth is that those at the top of British football do not care about getting rid of racism, they just don't want to hear it or see it. As soon as someone like Tour\u00e9 or Danny Rose gets abused in Eastern Europe there is shock and outrage from players, clubs and the authorities, yet no one is speaking about the people living in inner-cities like Brixton who, because of their appearance and their background, have become completely disenfranchised from society. Why don't they care? Because the powers-that-be have enough wealth to not worry about these people. Black players, in particular, should be tackling these issues because ultimately it will affect them when they retire. There are so many intelligent former black players, guys like Luther Blissett and Cyrille Regis, who never got a chance to become a top manager or a top coach because of the perception that surrounds people who look like them. They are black \u2013 which, for many, means they are good athletes but incapable of being anything above and beyond that. To a large extent this is down to unconscious racism and probably 99% of us are guilty of that \u2013 I know I am. We all have preconceptions of people based on what we have been told about them and their race and ethnicity. I still come across managers of a certain generation, those in their fifties and older, who say to me: \"I don't see you as black\", and think that is a compliment. So what, I don't walk around with my jeans down by my arse, smoking a spliff, so that means I'm not black? These are the attitudes we need to change if black people as a whole are going to progress, and the only way we can achieve that is through education. This is what footballers have to do \u2013 they cannot directly affect society but what they can do is use their standing in this country to make a wider audience aware of the wider issues surrounding race and stress the importance of understanding that what they have been told about a certain group of people is, in the main, wrong. That, for instance, the best occupations black people can aspire to is being a footballer, or a runner, or a singer. People look at Barack Obama and say: \"See, black people can be President\" \u2013 no they can't. Any black person who has been successful, particularly Obama, have been lifted out of blackness and stand as the exceptions. We need to talk openly about perceptions and not be afraid of the fact that we all have different views about different people based on how they look. There is nothing racist about an open, honest dialogue and it is certainly more productive then pointing the finger at the CSKA Moscow fans, or at Luis Su\u00e1rez or John Terry , and demanding they are punished. Personally, I don't blame Su\u00e1rez or Terry for what they did \u2013 they are simply products of a society and environment that allows them to think it is OK to speak about certain people in a certain way. It would be far better if instead of banning them and demonising them, the Football Association aimed to educate them and make them see that black people are undeserving of racial abuse. The truth is that Anton Ferdinand has more in common with Terry than he does with someone from Africa. They're wealthy guys from western culture who both drive Bentleys, both drink champagne and both listen to Tinie Tempah, yet Ferdinand is told he is different, that he part of a race open to insults? That is ridiculous and, again, is the product of historically incorrect preconceptions. Racism is never personal \u2013 it's about someone saying the group I am part of is more superior to the group you are part of. How, for instance, can a handsome, talented, beautiful black footballer be personally affected by a fat, ugly, unemployed fan calling them a black this or a black that? I used to get that when I was playing and I used to just look at the people doing it and think: 'You're abusing me? Look at you, how can you even dare abuse me?!' That is why it is pointless, and pretty ridiculous, to be worrying about a footballer getting racially abused \u2013 in no way are they the biggest sufferers, and, quite frankly, if I was someone like Tour\u00e9 or Rose I'd feel embarrassed if I had to look at someone who was suffering genuine racism and take their sympathy. A millionaire getting booed in Russia is nothing compared with generations of people never getting the chance to better their lives and those of their children. Physically we are different \u2013 east Africans, for instance, are genetically inclined to run long distances in shorter spaces of time \u2013 but intellectually and morally we all have the potential to be the same. That is the type of equality I am interested in and is the message I give when speaking at universities and other public forums. And that is what more people involved in football, black players in particular should be doing. Because unless you get rid of racism in society, you can never get rid of it in football and as things stand there will always be these one-off moments when a player is abused or booed purely because of the colour of their skin. Everyone goes into shock because they thought racism had disappeared from the game but how can it have done when it continues to exist in every other part of society at a more deep-seated, depressing level? Just because someone keeps their mouth shut for 90 minutes doesn't mean that for the rest of the week he isn't a racist, or hold unconsciously racist views, and until that is addressed, there will always be a problem. Tackling racism is a long and complicated process but one thing's for sure; it cannot be solved by banning a player or closing a part of a stadium. The problem is wider than that and if football really cared those involved in the game, players in particular, would worry less about one-off incidents like what happened to Tour\u00e9 when he played for Manchester City in Moscow and more about what is going on around them. Perceptions need to change and for that to happen, education needs to be pushed as the only way forward.

Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\n \n  \n\t  The Premier League 's expert group of doctors are to examine the rules around concussion and head injuries as Tottenham Hotspur were forced to defend their decision to keep their goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, on the pitch in the face of widespread criticism from Fifa, players' unions and charities. Spurs insisted that medical staff had given the all-clear for the manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas , to allow Lloris to play on following a collision with Everton's Romelu Lukaku that left him unconscious, but the Professional Footballers' Association called for the decision to be taken out of the hands of medical staff and substitution to be made mandatory. Fifa's chief medical officer, Professor Jiri Dvorak, said Spurs were wrong to keep Lloris on the pitch and the head injury charity Headway described the club's actions as \"dangerous and irresponsible\". Fifa, which has hosted a series of academic conferences with other sports to establish a consensus on the issue, reiterated its advice that \"any athlete with a suspected concussion should be removed from play, medically assessed and monitored for deterioration\". Fifpro, the international umbrella group for players' unions around the world, said it was alarmed that Lloris was allowed to play on. \"Villas-Boas and his staff failed to protect the goalkeeper by allowing him to see out the remainder of the match,\" it said. After the match, Villas-Boas hailed the bravery of his French goalkeeper, who collided with Lukaku in the 78th minute of the goalless draw: \"Hugo seemed assertive and determined to continue and showed great character and personality. We decided to keep him on based on that.\" Spurs insisted on Monday that their club doctor had given the go-ahead for Lloris to continue after assessing him and said a \"precautionary\" CT scan after the match had shown that he suffered no ill-effects. The club's head of medical services Wayne Diesel added: \"Once the relevant tests and assessments were carried out we were totally satisfied that he was fit to continue playing.\" The north London club did not say whether they had believed him to be concussed at the time. Fifa's chief medical officer said there was a \"99% probability that losing consciousness in such an event will result in concussion\". It is now understood that the Premier League Doctors' Group, which meets several times a season to share best practice and shape medical policies, will address the issue in the wake of several high- profile incidents that have involved Andros Townsend and Mathieu Flamini during the opening months of the season. Lukaku himself said he could not remember scoring his first goal for Everton after colliding with Joey O'Brien at Upton Park and being knocked out in the process. Dvorak said that Lloris should have been taken off regardless of whether he wanted to play on. \"The player should have been substituted,\" he said. \"The fact the other player needed ice on his knee means it's obvious the blow was extensive. When he has been knocked unconscious, the player himself may not see the reality. We have a slogan: if there is any doubt, keep the player out.\" Fifa's concussion guidelines, also agreed with the international rugby union, ice hockey and equestrian federations and updated this year, state: \"With every impact to the head, it is important that you always think of concussion and watch out for it. If you feel a little out of sorts, but think you can still play, that may not be a good idea. The safest is: 'when in doubt, keep out'.\" A Headway spokesman, Luke Griggs, said: \"We are hugely concerned that a professional football club should take such an irresponsible and cavalier attitude to a player's health.\" He said that guidelines from Headway and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence stated that people should not play any contact sport for at least three weeks after suffering a concussion. The PFA said it should be made mandatory for any player who has lost consciousness to be substituted. \"When treating a player on the pitch, it can be very difficult to determine the severity of a head injury,\" said its deputy chief executive, John Bramhall. \"It is important to take the pressure off the players, club medical staff, and the manager, removing the need for them to make a very difficult decision.\" The Football Association pointed to regulations that say a player should not return to the pitch for five days after being substituted for a head injury, a recommendation that saw Arsenal's Flamini miss a Champions League game this season. Its detailed guidelines say that a player who has been knocked unconscious should not play again that day. The rules do however allow for \"a transient alteration of conscious level\" following a head injury, which says a player can return to play following assessment by medical staff.", "topics": [], "author": "Owen Gibson", "wordCount": 807}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Moyes: Januzaj needs protection", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/334b77f9/sc/13/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A40Cmanchester0Eunited0Eadnan0Ejanuzaj0Edavid0Emoyes/story01.htm", "text": "Adnan Januzaj should learn from Barcelona's Lionel Messi how to handle being 'kicked up and down' says Manchester United manager David Moyes. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\n \n  \n\t  David Moyes has demanded greater protection for Adnan Januzaj and told the Manchester United teenager he must learn from Lionel Messi's example how to handle being \"kicked up and down\". Fulham's Sascha Riether was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association on Monday for apparently stamping on the 18-year-old during Saturday's match at Craven Cottage. The German defender is the first player to be charged under a new pilot scheme where three former referees \u2013 Steve Dunn, Eddie Wolstenholme and Alan Wiley \u2013 review video evidence of \"not seen\" incidents in Premier League games. Riether has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge. Moyes missed the controversy in the final minute at Fulham, as did the referee, Lee Probert, but, having reviewed the incident, he believes Riether deliberately targeted Januzaj. The United manager fears that sort of treatment has been reserved for the teenager in other matches, with Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin and Jos\u00e9 Fonte plus Stephen Ireland and Wilson Palacios of Stoke City booked for fouling Januzaj in recent weeks, and believes referees are not offering sufficient protection. Speaking before United's Champions League group game at Real Sociedad , and before confirmation of Riether's charge, Moyes said: \"I hadn't seen it until after the game, the view from the dugout made it impossible to see, but it's a bad stamp and it does look deliberate. \"It's over now but I do think Adnan is going to need a little bit more protection or we are going to find he is getting kicked up and down. I do think he deserves a little bit more than he is getting at this time.\" Moyes wants Januzaj to learn to ride any roughhouse tactics, however, and not respond with theatrics. He believes Messi offers the perfect example. Moyes said: \"We have spoken to him about it. I have got to say he gets kicked up and down in training every day and gets on with it. He's learned from the good professionals that he's got to get on with it. \"He only needs to look at Lionel Messi who is probably the best in the world at getting kicked, getting up and getting on with it and continuing to produce magic all the time. I'm not in any way comparing Adnan to Lionel Messi, so don't be saying that, but I'm certainly saying the way Lionel Messi gets up after being kicked, we hope that's the way Adnan continues to behave too. But he does need a little bit of protection. Somewhere along the line if he is going to continue playing in the fashion and style we want he'll need to get protection. It's up to referees to do what they think is right.\" United would move to within a point of qualification for the Champions League knockout phase with victory at Anoeta, and travelled to San Sebastian without the injured defenders Rafael da Silva and Jonny Evans. Michael Carrick, Tom Cleverley and Patrice Evra also have fitness concerns but are in the squad. Real Sociedad are without a point in Group A and could be eliminated but have, like United, improved domestically and moved into seventh place in La Liga with a 5-0 defeat of Osasuna on Saturday, their biggest league win for a decade. \"I certainly won't take anything for granted,\" Moyes said. \"I have a lot of respect for Sociedad. We will have to play well if we are going to get those 10 points which will get us over the line, but we have got ourselves in a good position in the group and we have to try to maintain that. I feel we are playing better now and getting some good results to go with it and long may that continue.\" United have a poor record in Spain, winning only two of 21 fixtures at La Liga opponents, and Moyes has not taken any advice on improving that sequence from Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography, which he was pictured bringing on the journey to the Basque region. \"I've not read it yet.

Photograph: Marius Becker/dpa/Corbis \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\n \n  \n\t  Unlike the rest of his team, Lasse Sobiech didn't leave the Volksparkstadion empty handed. Max Kruse gave the Hamburg defender his shirt as a souvenir at the final whistle. This didn't come as a huge surprise \u2013 the two had played at St Pauli together and are still good friends \u2013 but still felt a bit weird under the circumstances: two bad mistakes from Sobiech had gifted Kruse his two strikes in the 2-0 win, the first one for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach away from home. \"The way to play against him is to be horrible, he doesn't like it,\" Sobiech had said before the match with some confidence. And the 22-year-old, who'd only come in for the injured Johan Djourou, did play horribly, albeit not in the sense intended. His back-pass to Ren\u00e9 Adler was intercepted by the 24-year-old Foals striker to score in the 23rd minute, and in the 63rd he was robbed of the ball by Raffael to allow Kruse to decide the match. \"He's a good centre-back and will show that in the future,\" said the striker. \"I need to apologise to the team,\" Sobiech said later, hanging his head in shame. \"I messed up the game.\" That was undoubtedly true but Hamburg hadn't really offered much going forward and the visitors were on balance worth the three points. \"It was a pleasure to see them play,\" said Lucien Favre, who was particularly pleased with his men's pressing game. The Swiss coach had multiple reasons to celebrate. It was his side's first away win of the season, a win that confirmed their current status as the best side behind Bayern, Dortmund and Leverkusen, and on his 56th birthday 8,000 Borussia supporters serenaded him with \"happy birthday\" after the game. For Kruse, 25, it was a special occasion, too. The locally-born forward had confessed to dreaming about playing for Hamburg during the week. He used to sleep in HSV bed linen as a kid. But his favourite club never recognised his talent. Kruse played for rivals Werder Bremen and St Pauli, then broke through last season at Freiburg. Now, with seven goals in eleven games, he's the best German striker in the league and has become the figurehead of a Gladbach side that has belatedly coped with the 2012 departure of Dante, Roman Neust\u00e4dter and Marco Reus. \"I'm just happy that I was able to help the team today,\" he said with typical modesty. The \u20ac2.5m buy has galvanised the Borussia front-line. Raffael, Patrick Herrmann and Juan Arango all look much happier next to him than to club-record signing Luuk de Jong, who's been a big disappointment (and often injured) since making the move from Twente last season. Kruse's pace is such that he's great moving to the flanks or arriving late in the box; his passing is extraordinarily good, too: against HSV, he completed 46 out 48 attempts. He's both a \"nine\" and \"false nine\" and thus has a great chance to make Joachim L\u00f6w's World Cup squad. Within the dressing room, some credited the black away shirts for the win. Gladbach had worn these at their last win on the road in a friendly against Celtic in July. But the real reasons had less to do with choice of apparel and more with a rare clean sheet: unlike typical Favre sides, this team had struggled to find the right balance behind their potent front line. The only sustained bombardment keeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen had to endure was a salvo of Mon Cherie pralines thrown down by the Hamburg fans in the first half. (They've just come into season again after the summer break). If the much-coveted manager \u2013 Schalke, Lyon and Marseille were all interested in his services in the summer \u2013 can get his defence to play with the same efficiency as his attack, Gladbach will be favourites to finish in fourth spot for the second time in two years. According to Kicker, they've only needed 65 chances to score 25 goals; in other words, they've converted 38.5% of their goalscoring opportunities. No team in the Bundesliga has been this clinical. For Hamburg, a bigger club in a much bigger, much wealthier city, the continued progress of Gladbach serves as a painful reminder of their own ineptitude. And the Foals are not finished yet. Favre has made them much less reliant on counterattacks, while the board are doing their best to tie both the coach and keeper Ter Stegen to longer contracts. Reports suggest that both will renew their deals fairly soon. Just like Kruse, Favre was in generous mood and allowed the players to drink \"whatever they want\" on the coach journey back \u2013 provided it was either \"coffee, tea or mineral water\". That strict directive was later relaxed to permit \"up to three beers per player\", Bild reported. Talking Points While Borussia Dortmund were at their awe-inspiring best against hapless Stuttgart \u2013 Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in the 6-1 win on Friday night , league leaders Bayern Munich eked out an unconvincing 2-1 win at Hoffenheim . The result saw the Bavarians equal the Hamburg's record of 36 unbeaten Bundesliga games from 30 years ago but no one seemed to be happy. Pep Guardiola went as far as threatening to change \"his system\" in the light of the lacklustre performance. Sami Hyypia hadn't changed his system but his entire frontline for Bayer Leverkusen's the game at Braunschweig \u2013 and suffered a somewhat embarrassing 1-0 defeat, thanks to a late Domi Kumbela goal. \"When the bottom team in the table makes you play this badly, you have no arguments,\" said the dejected sporting director Rudi V\u00f6ller. Hyypia later said he didn't regret resting Son Heung-min, Stefan Kiessling and Sidney Sam ahead of their trip to Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday. Whether it was inexperience on the coach's behalf or an overestimation of his squad players is ultimately immaterial: the game showed that Leverkusen simply do not have the depth to challenge Bayern and Dortmund seriously for the title. For Freiburg, it was the first win of the season; for N\u00fcrnberg the sort of defeat that gets everybody very hot under the collar. Not only did the Franconians lose 3-0 at home to get sucked right into the relegation fight, a few hundred supporters also angrily sought explanations for the poor result. N\u00fcrnberg had actually started pretty well but that was forgotten after the final whistle, when captain Raphael Sch\u00e4fer tried to talk to the irate supporters \u2013 only to be sent back immediately. He threw down his armband on the way back to the dressing room. The FCN faithful have never forgiven the keeper for his (mild) quip after losing against local rivals F\u00fcrth last season (\"What use is a derby win if you go down?), and new manager Gertjan Verbeek could have done without this civil unrest. \"Verbeek's only success was no one asking about his perceived resemblance of Rod Stewart this time,\" wrote S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. There was distinct lack of Halloween hi-jinx in the Bundesliga \u2013 carnival is where it's at in Germany \u2013 but following on from Kiessling's \"Loch Netz Monster\" (Bild) (Loch is hole in German, Netz net) stunt, Sunday saw more ghostly action between the sticks. This time, there wasn't so much a phantom but a Polter guy in goal: Sebastian Polter, a striker for Mainz who had to put on the gloves after Christian Wetklo was sent off for a professional foul on Augsburg the forward Arkadiusz Milik shortly before the end. \"It was a rear-end collision,\" explained Wetklo, who had himself come on as a 46th-minute substitute for the injured Heinz M\u00fcller. Polter impressively saved the ensuing free-kick from Daniel Baier and acquitted himself well; the 22-year-old played as a keeper until the age of 12. But it didn't help. Augsburg won 2-1 thanks to an Andr\u00e9 Hahn solo show with two fine goals.

Even before the avalanche of criticism that greeted the decision by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, apparently with the consent of the club's doctor, to leave Tottenham's goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, on the pitch at Goodison Park, the prevalence of head injuries among top-flight footballers appeared to have increased during the opening months of the season. In the absence of conclusive figures from the Premier League and the Football Association, it is impossible to say whether there has been an increase in incidents, or if it is simply that those that have happened have had a higher profile. Part of the reason may be that the debate surrounding head injuries and concussion in other sports, most notably rugby and American football, has hit the headlines in recent weeks. In rugby union , there has been a backlash against plans to trial a scheme to reduce the length of enforced absence from the field to as little as five minutes following a concussion assessment at the side of the pitch. Despite assurances that the protocol would be safe, some say the new International Rugby Board rule could put players in danger in an era when the sport is faster, and players are bulkier and stronger, than ever. In the US, the National Football League has agreed to pay $765m to 4,500 former professionals who joined a class action lawsuit alleging that the NFL spent decades hiding the harmful effects of the sport on the brain. The NFL settlement admitted no liability and critics said it failed to deal with the ongoing issue. Just as rugby was accused of burying its head in the sand when the scale of the problem in American football became clear, so football is likely to face some difficult questions. As a completely different sort of contact sport, the number of instances where a player is likely to suffer concussion or a serious head injury is going to be smaller but the potential consequences are just as serious. In 2008, the third Consensus Conference on Concussion in Sport took place at Fifa's HQ in Zurich and established what was described at the time as a breakthrough agreement across football, rugby union, the International Olympic Committee, the International Ice Hockey Federation and the International Equestrian Federation that any player or rider suffering concussion should leave the field immediately. The decision was ratified last November at the fourth edition of the conference. The autobiographies of footballers are littered with references to concussion, smelling salts, shaking off blows to the head or playing on while not being entirely sure where they were. Michael Owen describes taking an \"almighty blow to the head\" during the friendly against Morocco in which he scored his first international goal. He says that following a later incident at Derby County he had \"whiplash for a week\" and swore he would never again use the word concussion unless he was \"clinically unconscious\". Those international conferences, which began in 2001 and led to a common protocol for determining whether a player was suffering from concussion, and the growing collaboration between medical staff in a range of sports, indicate the extent to which the condition has moved up the agenda in recent years. The incident at Goodison, and the other high-profile examples witnessed this season, may highlight a gap between the rules and reality. The Premier League's rule 0.9 states: \"Any player, whether engaged in a league match, any other match or in training, who having sustained a head injury leaves the field of play, shall not be allowed to resume playing or training (as the case may be) until he has been examined by a medical practitioner and declared fit to do so.\" The FA has a \"policy\", but not a hard-and-fast rule, that a player who has been substituted for a serious head injury or concussion should not return to playing or training for five days. Both of those rules appear to vest huge responsibility on the club doctor on duty on the day. It is for them to determine whether the player in question has suffered concussion and, as such, should be removed from the field of play. The Spurs head of medical services, Wayne Diesel, said: \"Once the relevant tests and assessments were carried out we were totally satisfied that he [Lloris] was fit to continue playing.\" But, as the Professional Footballers' Association argues, perhaps the time has come to take the decision out of the hands of the doctor on duty and require any player who is knocked unconscious or suffers a serious blow to the head to be removed automatically. That would risk inviting a round of debate over who should have the final say over whether a player should leave the field, but \u2013 in an area where all the medical advice urges extreme caution \u2013 it might avoid club staff being placed in an invidious position.", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 878}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Can David Beckham succeed in Miami where others have failed?", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/334a9edf/sc/35/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A40Cdavid0Ebeckham0Emiami0Emls0Etoros0Efusion/story01.htm", "text": "David Beckham attends the Miami Heat vs Brooklyn Nets NBA game on November 1, 2013. Photograph: James Devaney/WireImage \n\n \n\n\n  \n    \n\t David Beckham has taken a break from being a Disney Knight, modeling underwear, going out on loan to Europe, and all other important Beckham-matters to express a strong interest in owning an MLS franchise \u2026in Miami. \n MLS fans recall the two stages of Beckham-mania in the US. The first stage \u2013 lots of teeny boppers pay money to see Beckham play, gate receipts go up, but Beckham is often injured and the Galaxy suck. Then, the second era \u2013 Beckham gets his fitness, the Galaxy win trophies, but the aura and gate receipts return to earthly levels. \n Beckham the player had a great impact on MLS. He succeeded as a promoter and player. But Beckham the owner? I have doubts, largely irrespective of Sir David. Rather, I\u2019m suspicious about anything sports-related in Miami. \n I begin with a simple question: is Miami really a sports town? Let\u2019s look at the attendance stats for the current professional teams. The Miami Dolphins play in the NFL and American Football is easily the most popular sport in the US. Miami is currently 20th out of 32 teams in terms of attendance. Sun Life Stadium has a capacity of 75,000 , but the Dolphins draw about 67,000. That\u2019s still a pretty good occupancy rate. The Dolphins are also a middling team, so the interest is very good taking into account how poor the on-the-field product is. \n The next most popular sport is baseball. Miami\u2019s team, the Florida Marlins, succeed in hisses and fits. They\u2019ve won a few World Series, but also fielded some pretty bad teams during rebuilding years. Right now, the team\u2019s attendance is 30th out of 31 . That is awful. Deadspin predicted an attendance drop this year and gleefully mocked the public/private partnership responsible for the stadium . On the plus side, the blue seats make for a serious deep blue sea \u201c ocean vibe \u201d when folks don\u2019t show up. Still, if Miami fans turn on a team in a league with a luxury tax like MLB, what would be they do when a team in a league with a salary cap (like MLS) has to rebuild? Then again, every team that fields a bad product will fail on some level. MLS is no exception. \n Soccer won\u2019t catch up with American Football or baseball for several decades, but is close behind basketball and hockey. Thus, comparisons to those sports may be more warranted. Still, the Miami Heat\u2019s attendance is amazing , but probably down more to winning championships and fielding the league\u2019s best player than general sports interest. In fact, if you look back at the team pre-Lebron, their attendance was usually middle of the pack . In 2009, they drew about 18,000 and ranked 15th out of 30 teams. They were even ranked 15th in 2001 before drafting Dwayne Wade, so they\u2019ve gotten consistent support even when the team was not so hot. \n Of course, inter-sports comparisons are not perfect. While in each American city there exists a roaming pack of casual fans that only follow winning teams (the herd), each sport has dedicated fans (the pack). Miami has an admittedly large Hispanic population, but\u2026but\u2026a large chunk is Cuban. Going by totally unresearched stereotypes within the Latin community, Cubans\u2026like baseball. Soccer, not so much. True, Miami is home to plenty of South American expats. But how will their cultured tastes adapt to MLS (and that pesky salary cap)? \n Sports and demographics aside, there\u2019s history. I speak of the Toros and the Fusion. The who? Exactly. The Miami Toros sprang into life in 1973, after the Washington Darts of the North American Soccer League decided to move down South. The Toros lumbered along for three years in the Orange Bowl before moving to Ft. Lauderdale and rechristening as The Strikers. The team never won the NASL, but did finish runner-up in 1974. Their dynamic forward tandem of Warren Archibald and Steve David lit the nets aflame, but it wasn\u2019t enough: the team left town in 1983 for Minnesota. \n Thus, soccer has tried and failed in Miami. Neither Miami proper nor Ft. Lauderdale could support a team. The NASL collapsed under its own weight, you say. True, but other teams lasted longer than a decade. The intra-city moves are an ominous sign. And the more recent history is even more depressing. \n In 1996, MLS opened its doors and rode the wave of soccer interest after the 1994 World Cup in the US. In 1997, the Miami Fusion entered the league and ominously played in the old home of the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers (a converted high school stadium). The team barely lasted four years. They were shut down due to low season ticket sales and no corporate sponsorships . The Miami Fusion have the wikipedia game honor of winning the Supporters Shield at the best regular season team right before being contracted. Not relocated. Contracted. \n Can Beckham reverse this trend? Could he build a winner to win over sometimes fickle Miami fans? Could a stadium misstep lead to Marlins-esque disaster ? I am sure that Beckham would invest more than the old Fusion owners and land some corporate sponsorships on brand alone, but I\u2019m not sold on decent season ticket sales. Twice, Miami has had a pro soccer team. Twice, it has failed.

Unfortunately, despite being a constant presence in MLS's postseason, the Sounders have developed another more dispiriting tradition: Underperforming in opening legs. \n \u2022 In 2009, Seattle was held to a 0-0 at home against Houston in the conference semifinals. \n \u2022 The next year, LAwon 1-0 in Seattle, putting the Sounders on a path to another semifinal exit. \n \u2022 In 2011 Seattle were blitzed in Utah, losing 3-0 to Real Salt Lake. \n \u2022 Last year, the team out-performed RSL in the first leg at home, even though the match ended 0-0. In the conference final, however, the Galaxy won the opening leg in Carson, 3-0. \n Coming into this postseason, Seattle had played five opening legs, lost three, and have never scored a goal, a pattern of underachievement that continued through 90 minutes Saturday at CenturyLink. Opening a series which will serve as the final say for regional bragging rights, the Sounders gave up a goal to rival Portland against the run of play in the 15th minute. Just after the hour, a sublime touch before a right-footed blast allowed Darlington Nagbe to double Portland's lead: \n \n\t \n  \t Seattle had played fine \u2013 their quantity of chances serving as a post-match silver lining \u2013 yet there they were: at home, in a playoff opener, against their arch rivals, down by two. \n Seattle were the much more dangerous side through the match's final moments, their desperation paying off in the 90th minute when Osvaldo Alonso broke through, recording the first opening leg goals in the team's playoff history. Yet though it ended a 540-minute scoreless drought, the score did little to change the bigger picture. There's something endemic to this team that's causing this 'First Leg Syndrome'. \n Is it mentality? That's been suggested before. Preparation may be a different way of saying the same thing. Are these results the product of most of these first legs being at home against higher seeds? Or maybe we're assuming home field is worth more than it is? (More on that subject in a while). \n Regardless, Seattle's down 2-1 after Saturday's result and with a tough assignment to win through in Portland. RF \n Is this finally New York\u2019s year? \n Fans and media keep looking for fissures, scanning for signs that these are the same old Red Bulls, a talented team of anti-destiny that never, ever seems to equal the sum of its pricey parts.\u00a0Once past some early season struggles, first-year manager Mike Petke\u2019s club found its feet (it\u2019s extremely talented feet, it must be said) and has reliably improved through the months, consistently gathering momentum, steadily identify the best individual roles. \n The Red Bulls may have to squint to see it today, after\u00a0 a match that got away somewhat in Houston, but Petke\u2019s men remain in fairly good shape following a 2-2 road draw \u00a0in the first leg of a home-and-away conference semifinal series. The loss of commanding center back Jamison Olave to a (needless, heedless and careless) red card gives Wednesday\u2019s return leg a more tenuous feel, but there is every reason to believe this Red Bull version, locker room intact and egos mostly in check, can manage this one out just fine. \n Two main reasons, in fact: The first, blindingly illuminated over a telling first-half on a sunny fall Sunday in Texas, is the yawning talent gap that exists between these two Eastern Conference clubs. \n That, and the fact that Dominic Kinnear\u2019s strange mastery (wizardry, really) of the MLS playoffs can only go so far. The Dynamo manager clearly knows his way around the post-season, but \u2026 well, see the first reason. \n Petke\u2019s tactics were perfect for a match at BBVA Compass Stadium, which features the league\u2019s narrowest pitch. New York perfected the approach while winning twice there in the regular season by a combined 7-1. The field is too small to dilly-dally with pretty possession, so Petke\u2019s team doesn\u2019t bother. They sit and counter, and do so with brutal efficiency thanks to wily and sophisticated vets like Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill. Even newfound playmaker Peguy Luyindula, a Frenchman schooled at Lyon, Marseille and PSG, knows just where to find the space, where and when to quickly collect the ball in transition. From there, Henry and Cahill\u2019s movement, instinctive and sharp, can be overwhelming for younger, less sophisticated defenders. \n And it didn\u2019t help that Houston was missing one center back, underrated Jamaican international Jermaine Taylor. Replacement Eric Brunner had a bad, bad day, culpable on both of the visitors\u2019 first-half goals, one on Cahill\u2019s sharp header and one from Eric Alexander. New York took a 2-0 lead into intermission. \n The return leg will be tense because Houston, abetted by Olave\u2019s 65th minute ejection \u2013staying on the field was always the guy\u2019s issue, whether due to injury or suspension, which is why Real Salt Lake traded the big Colombian in winter, even though he could dominate like so few in MLS \u2013 found two second-half strikes through shear will, pressure, one deflection and one stoppage time goal-mouth scramble. It was classic Dynamo defiance, determined stuff from a team that gets the very most from its collection of draft picks and bargain bin finds. (New York started three Americans and a bunch of foreign-trained types; Houston\u2019s lineup featured nine home-grown Americans.) \n But will this be enough? Can Houston, a straight 4-4-2 bunch with two midfield toilers but not an ounce of central creativity, dig up enough chances on the road? Cahill sounds confident, and rightly so. Here\u2019s how he explained the squandering of a two-goal lead, while sounding quite resolute about the impending result: \u201cWe had a red card, and on the second goal we didn\u2019t pick up the runner. It happens in football. But we\u2019re a strong team; we can play away from home \u2026 so there\u2019s a lot of good things we can take away from this.\u201d\u00a0 SD \n Real Salt Lake playing with fire \n It was the turning point in last season's march to MLS Cup. Los Angeles had left Carson down a goal to San Jose, but after an early Robbie Keane goal had pulled the Galaxy even, Landon Donovan pulled the strings on one of LA's trademark counter attacks, finding Keane cutting across the back of the defense for an easy go-ahead goal. The Galaxy never relinquished that lead, their counter attack key to eliminating the Supporters' Shield winners on their way to a second-straight MLS Cup. \n During their run to back-to-back titles, that type of ruthless precision has become their calling card: Donovan pressing forward with the ball while Keane's runs dissect a defense. Transcending two years and seven playoff matchups, no opponent has stopped LA's most dangerous weapon, a reality that defined Real Salt Lake's approach to Sunday night. \n The West's second seed made the surprise choice of injecting Yordany Alvarez into the lineup, giving the Claret and Cobalt a destroyer to accompany Kyle Beckerman at the base of midfield. Though LA found other ways to threaten, their transition was muted, with only Sean Franklin's early second half blast separating the sides: \n \n\t \n  \t By the hour mark, Jason Kreis wanted that goal back. Not content to take a one-goal deficit back to Utah, the RSL boss pulled Alvarez, brought on Robbie Findley, and left Beckerman to protect the defense. What ensued was 30 minutes of increased RSL pressure and seemingly endless Galaxy counters. \n Surprisingly, RSL survived. Donovan and Keane stayed high, were found with relative ease by their teammates, yet could not break down Nat Borchers and Chris Schuler. RSL's central defenders, playing as if they'd spent the last 10 days working on counters, elected to give space, allow Donovan to carry the ball deep before making a decision, and refrained from making any commitments that would open space for Keane to exploit. Eventually, Donovan was either forced into a low percentage decision or hurried by players tracking back. \n Whether that plan is sustainable for leg two depends on your interpretation of the results. Despite numerous chances on the break, Keane and Donovan didn't break through, but there were so many times a sprawling block or bad touch decided the outcome, you can't help but think RSL are playing with fire. Then again, maybe you can't stop LA's counter unless you risk getting burned. RF \n Lessons learned by Sporting Kansas City \u2026 or were they? \n Almost exactly one year ago, a strong Kansas City side with two standouts who would soon be Premier League men, went into Houston for an MLS playoff. Peter Vermes\u2019 side, driven then by Roger Espinoza industry and Kei Kamara\u2019s shear physical capacity, fell behind by a goal in the first-leg. \n Thing is, Vermes\u2019 club had just one gear then, only one hell-bent, hard-pressing speed. And they leaned into it, chasing the deficit, straining to scoop the draw and hoping to jet home sitting pretty in the home-and-away clash. \n Instead, Sporting KC conceded a second goal, and Vermes quickly wondered aloud if perhaps his team should have re-considered those critical moments? Sure enough, back at home a few nights later, KC pressed and shot and crossed and huffed and puffed \u2026 but could ultimately put just one goal past Houston\u2019s besieged back line. Houston advanced. Vermes, having watched a formidable bunch ousted for a second consecutive year in maddeningly similar style, reconfigured his team\u2019s approach to the game. He wanted a little less hurry and harry, a little more possession and thoughtful design. \n So, uh \u2026 what happened? \n Saturday night outside Boston, his men of ample playoff experience came up against a far less experienced New England Revolution bunch , one that hasn\u2019t seen playoff soccer since former Liverpool man Steve Nicol took the team to the 2009 post-season. Only, it was New England that managed the match with prudence rather than Sporting KC. \n The soccer was fairly terrible thanks to a hideous field \u2013 artificial turf, shortened to just 106 yards, slick from rain and blighted by those dizzying American football lines that crush the game\u2019s aesthetic, pretty much the sum of all fears for anyone hoping to enjoy a match. But New England made the safe plays, only bothered on occasion when Sporting\u2019s U.S. international Graham Zusi could pick out a pass or two. Zusi, in fact, was the only attacking player who found the passing speed through the messy first 45 as the defenses were clearly in charge. \n New England was better after the break, slowly adding players into the attack, and the controversial first goal came from Andy Dorman. Three men were clearly offside \u2013 or clearly onside \u2013 depending on which way your Twitter feed leaned. Truthfully, this was a tough one, as a ball pinged around before Dorman\u2019s tap-in. (The original shot came from 18-year-old Diego Fagundez, the team\u2019s fabulously talented 13-goal scorer.) Incensed Kansas City men did not handle this well, immediately undone, frustrated, lobbying, hollering, pressing, fouling, etc. And what happens then? \n Yep, a second goal. Just 12 minutes later, Stoke City-bound Juan Agudelo and playmaker Lee Nguyen sliced through the visitors\u2019 defense, arranging a sly finish from underrated second-year man Kelyn Rowe . \n Vermes\u2019 team got a little lucky when the Revolution\u2019s impulsive midfielder Dimitry Imbongo fouled unnecessarily along the flank. The resulting free kick, parlayed with some marking that simply will not cut it, halved deficit. But that was somewhat lucky \u2013 and now Kansas City must return home, needing to two goals to advance. \n Does that sound familiar?\u00a0 SD \n Playoffs format questions \n For eight months the teams of Major League Soccer slog through a long-haul regular season for the right to go to the playoffs. Nine teams out of 19 are eliminated by this process. Six more are eliminated in the next week. Twelve days into the playoffs, only three games of the MLS season will remain. And yet these three games will be spread out over a month. \n MLS pushes through the playoffs with indecent haste. On Wednesday playoff games are even scheduled at the same time when these are surely the games that the league hopes all fans will watch, not just the supporters of those teams.\u00a0(And that's not even getting into the bewildering array of broadcasters that are showing the games). \n So, the playoffs are complicated by an international weekend breaking up the pattern. Regular season games went ahead during the international weekends, though. With the USA playing on Friday and Tuesday, would it not have made sense for a big weekend of US soccer to feature internationals\u00a0 and \u00a0playoff games?\u00a0 \n The compressed nature of the early playoff schedule is also surely to the detriment of the teams that have battled all year for the better regular season record? Because the higher seeded teams play the first leg on the road, it means that they will face more travelling in a very short time. If the Red Bulls overcome Houston in the second leg, they will then travel to SKC or New England. Two aways game and one at home in ten days. What advantage is there in that? The higher seed will have the benefit of hosting extra-time and penalties should the ties be level after 180 minutes (with no away goals rule in use). But that's it. \n This is the showpiece time of year for MLS. Surely they would want to make the most of it?\u00a0 SB", "topics": [], "author": null, "wordCount": 2251}, {"date": "2013-11-04 00:00:00", "domain": "www.theguardian.com", "title": "Wayne Rooney's grundies", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663845/s/33495aa3/sc/8/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfootball0C20A130Cnov0C0A40Cthe0Efiver0Ewayne0Erooney0Egrundies/story01.htm", "text": "Celebrating Manchester United's new partnership.

While the irony of United having an official laundry partner will be lost on no one when it has been such a struggle for them to keep clean sheets this season \u2013 and that, readers, is why The Fiver got the humour gig \u2013 their Group Managing Director, Richard Arnold, was positively beaming upon delivering the news, almost going as far to hail the deal as even bigger than the time they won the Treble. \"This is a very exciting partnership for Manchester United,\" he blathered, speaking in between taking gulps of air provided by United's official oxygen provider, Planet Earth. \"With its great portfolio of personal care and laundry products we are confident that our partnership will bring more than 130 million followers we have across these countries closer to the club.\" And good luck to Unilever for their first assignment, namely washing the stench off that steaming pile of horse puckey. But perhaps we should not be too dismissive or cynical. After all, this really is a big day for United, given that they have not exactly developed a reputation of late for being keen and resourceful negotiators when it comes to sealing important deals, missing out on the signings of Cesc F\u00e1bregas, Ander Herrera, Leighton Baines, Luka Modric and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara. OK, so Unilever might not be able to play left-back, or centre-back, or right wing, or left wing, or central midfield, unless some company stooge can be found to fill in on match days. But look at the big picture: Rooney's grundies are going to be positively sparkling and that's the most important thing.

On Monday the club's manager, Pepe Mel, felt the need to hold a press conference to insist he wasn't going to abandon ship. On Tuesday, the ultras turned up at the training ground to abuse the players, soon heading to the manager's office for an impromptu private meeting. On Wednesday, he held another press conference claiming he had no choice but to invite them in, and the team slipped into the relegation zone. On Thursday, they missed a penalty. Twice. On Friday, the club published an official communiqu\u00e9 blaming the training ground incident on Mel. On Saturday, their most expensive summer signing went into hospital with appendicitis. And on Sunday, their centre-back broke his jaw and M\u00e1laga broke their hearts. It sure hadn't been Betis's week. In the 94th minute, late, very late, on Sunday, the ball hit the goalkeeper, hit the bar and then hit the net. Twice they had come back from a goal down; now they had been defeated again, 3-2. In the penalty area, Betis players sunk to their knees, disbelief stretched across their faces. Over on the touchline, their manager threw down his bottle of water in anger, head about to explode. \"It's mad that we didn't win this,\" he said later. Mad, but worryingly familiar. Betis haven't won since September. This morning they sit in the relegation zone on nine points, the same number as Rayo Vallecano and Almer\u00eda. The European positions that they aspired to stand 10 points away. In eight days they've picked up a solitary point and they've plummeted seven places in a fortnight. Betis lost 5-0 at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid last Sunday, after which midfielder Matilla said: \"This can't go on.\" But it went on. And on. \"It would be dram\u00e1tico if we didn't beat Levante,\" the manager admitted. Four days, three press conferences and one training ground invasion later, they didn't beat Levante. It finished 0-0 after Jorge Molina had a penalty saved by Keylor Navas, got the chance to take it again and had it saved again. As if that wasn't bad enough; Levante's manager is the former Sevilla coach, Joaqu\u00edn Caparr\u00f3s, an anti-b\u00e9tico and proud of it. And on Sunday night, they were beaten 3-2 by M\u00e1laga \u2013 a side who hadn't even scored in four games. \"We're not on a good run,\" said Mel. He can say that again. The risk is that he might have to: it hasn't been a good week and Betis can't help fearing it's not going to get much better, either. Next Sunday they face Barcelona and after that it's city rivals Sevilla. \"I have to take the positives,\" Mel insisted. On Sunday, they went into the game with 11 players unavailable. By the end of the match that figure had grown: Javi Chica will miss out next week through a suspension he should have served this week, and after a clash of heads with Fabrice, Damien Perquis was carried off in an ambulance unconscious, not moving, a brace round his neck. \"We still don't know how he is,\" Mel sighed. News filtered through and it was good news: a double fracture to the jaw. Betis had feared it would be worse. The way the week had gone, that's hardly surprising. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. \"Everyone's very down,\" Nacho admitted. They'd been beaten by Getafe and Elche before but it had started to go really, really wrong with the 5-0 defeat at Atl\u00e9tico, a defeat that brought some of the underlying tension to the surface. On the train home late on Sunday night/Monday morning, supporters were far from happy. Mel admitted \"it wasn't nice\" and took a decision. The next day he called a press conference. Some wondered if it the division's longest serving manager \u2013 he took over in 2011 \u2013 was about to announce his resignation. Instead, he admitted that he had made mistakes \u2013 the rotation policy wasn't working, for one \u2013 but insisted that resignation would be a coward's way out. To do so would make him a \"bad b\u00e9tico.\" Mel invited the fans to back the team. The following day's training session was opened to the public. It was, some said, an invitation to trouble ; what followed was inevitable. In the stands at the club's training ground, a group of supporters gathered. \"Shameless sons of bitches,\" they shouted. \"Your arse is too expensive to be dragging along the ground.\" \"Come and suck it, Mel!\" \"You're laughing in the face of the Betis fans!\" Eventually, the fans were invited to talk to Mel and the club captains. A group of them headed into the manager's office for a \"chat\". \"We had to talk to them,\" Mel said the next day, \"or else they would have stopped the session.\" He had little choice . That was one version of events. In the presidential offices, the club had a different view; an institutional communiqu\u00e9 insisting that if the ultras were there it was because someone had let them be there hinted at a division. Private messages made it explicit: the relationship between board and manager is strained, virtually broken, and this week has made it worse. Rather than seeing an act of leadership in his public accountability, some implied that Mel had engineered the meeting to get fans on his side and strengthen his position, to make him the good guy, the one listening to the fans, the one who cares. If that makes sacking him harder, it was already far from simple. Betis are still in administration: every fortnight, a formal report gets sent to the courts and any decision must be explicitly recommended and signed off, responsibility claimed in writing. And that's a responsibility no one wants to take. Not least because even his detractors recognise that Mel has been successful, that he has carried Betis a long way. In the midst of a power vacuum, he led the club to a brilliant promotion to La Liga . A creditable 13th-place finish followed, playing some lovely football. Then they finished 7th, and in a European place. They started this season with a hugely impressive performance against Real Madrid, despite losing 2-1 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, and they defeated Valencia 3-1, with Salva Sevilla scoring twice and making the other. Slick and sharp. But there was trouble ahead. Sevilla has made just four starts and this summer 14 players left. Among them, the central midfield trio of Ca\u00f1as, Be\u00f1at Exteberr\u00eda and Rub\u00e9n P\u00e9rez. Add to that the fact Betis have been without the injured Rub\u00e9n Castro, last year's top-scorer, who has played only 22 minutes in the league (during which time he scored). Fourteen players came in for a total cost of \u20ac4.3m. On the face of it there were some exciting signings \u2013 Joan Verd\u00fa, especially, and Cedrick, who blew everyone away at the Bernab\u00e9u. But one signing needs time to settle, let alone 14. Betis were heading into Europe, too, via a Europa League qualifying round. And that's not always a good sign: last time they played in Europe, in 2006, they finished 14th after a fourth-place finish the year before. So Mel rotated and it didn't work; the squad is short, resources shorter and the season long. Defeat to M\u00e1laga was Betis's 17th game already this season, and their third in a disastrous week. Talking points \u2022 Another game, two more assists for Gareth Bale: the first, a superb right-footed cross for Karim Benzema to head home, the second a swift robbery of the ball and neat pull back for Cristiano Ronaldo that destroyed the Rayo Vallecano full-back Arbilla. Taken off almost immediately after, he sat and sobbed on the bench. Rayo, though, responded. Perhaps in part because, by then, Xabi Alonso, back after injury and playing for the first time this season, was on the bench too. With him went Real's control. \"The second half was a disaster,\" Carlo Ancelotti said. Two penalties from Jonathan Viera \u2013 the first following an awesome bit of skill, the second after an oafish challenge from Marcelo \u2013 made it 3-2. The team with the annual budget of \u20ac7m was steamrollering the team with the annual budget of over \u20ac500m, racking up 23 shots and missing some incredible chances. But the equaliser just wouldn't come. After the game, Ancelotti applauded the Rayo manager, Paco J\u00e9mez, and asked if he wouldn't mind letting him watch him train one day. \u2022 Ronaldo scored one and sent another flying into the crowd, where it hit a young girl \u2013a Rayo fan aged around 12 or 13. The Portuguese gave her his shirt by way of apology and she was delighted. If that was classy, what followed was not. Soon some supporters round the girl started chanting for her to \"burn it\" and eventually the shirt was handed to a security guard, the girl forced to give it up. Pathetic. \u2022 Goal of the week: Pab\u00f3n scored a rocket as Valencia beat Getafe 1-0 . But probably the week's best goal came late, very late, in Granada's trip to Levante. Thanks to a floodlight failure, the game went on almost quarter of an hour longer than it should have done and in the 19th minute, about the time that Betis and M\u00e1laga were kicking-off at the Rosaleda, Granada got a free kick. Piti lined up by the ball while team-mate Iturra stood in front of the goalkeeper trying to put him off. Piti's free kick flew into the corner . \"Standing in front of the goalkeeper blocks the view of the goalkeeper, but that's perfectly legal, according to a circular we got sent earlier this season,\" shrugged Caparr\u00f3s, the Levante manager. \u2022 The daftest goal of the week was Celta's \u2013 handed to them by Sevilla keeper Beto, who played the ball straight to Alex L\u00f3pez. \u2022 \"Is it really so difficult to break the line of pressure that Atl\u00e9tico apply?\" Came the question. Ernesto Valverde, the Athletic Bilbao manager, paused slightly and then replied. \"Yes. Mucho.\" Later he said: \"I see a huge gap between the top three and everyone else.\" Diego Simeone's team were sensational again, beating Athletic 2-0 with goals from David Villa and Diego Costa. There was another assist for Koke, too. The only surprise was that it ended 2-0. The shots on target count read: 8-0. \"Costa is enormous in every way,\" Simeone said. \u2022 Suso shouldn't have been playing this weekend. He was one of 10 players who picked up a fifth, suspension-inducing yellow card during week 11 but none of those cards could be ratified by the competition committee on Friday. Why? Because it was a bank holiday and they were having a day off. Even though there was a game in the LF\"P\": Barcelona were playing Espanyol. And so it was that on Saturday night, Suso provided the cross from which Rodri headed (and for 'head' read 'hand') in the winner. Almer\u00eda had waited 11 weeks for their first victory; now they have picked up two in three days. It shouldn't have taken this long: they really haven't been playing badly at all. \u2022 Almost twice as many fans turned up for Oviedo versus Racing in the Second Division B, Spain's third to seventh tier, as turned up for a European clash between Getafe and Valencia at the Coliseum. The same Coliseum \u00c1ngel Torres, the Getafe president, wants to swap for a 30,000 -seater stadium. Racing won 3-2. Results : Barcelona 1-0 Espanyol, Real Sociedad 5-0 Osasuna, Almer\u00eda 1-1 Valladolid, Rayo 2-3 Real Madrid, Sevilla 0-1 Celta, Getafe 0-1 Valencia, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2-0 Athletic Bilbao, Levante 0-1 Granada, M\u00e1laga 3-2 Real Betis.

Veteran guard Richie Incognito is alleged to have left intimidating messages and texts on the phone of second-year offensive tackle Jonathan Martin, who left the team last week. The Dolphins had not previously provided details to explain Martin's absence.  As for Incognito, \"He's done\" in Miami, a source tells The Miami Herald . The source continued, \"There are procedures in place and everyone wants to be fair. The NFL is involved. But from a club perspective he'll never play another game here.\"  Martin, a Stanford graduate who was a second-round pick by the Dolphins in the 2012 NFL draft, is the son of two lawyers. He was a classics major at Stanford, according to NPR's Mike Pesca, who adds that Martin also considered Harvard, where he would have been the first ever fourth-generation African-American at the school.  But at the Miami Dolphins' facilities, Martin was called \"big weirdo\" \u2014 a moment from last year's training camp that was chronicled on HBO's Hard Knocks NFL show. Transcripts circulating today show that he was called far worse names more recently, as Incognito reportedly used slurs referring to Martin, who is biracial.  \"Martin left Dolphins headquarters [last] Monday when finally reaching his limit with the persistent bullying and teasing from some teammates that has plagued him since joining Miami,\" reports Fox Sports. The network says Martin left the team after \"a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them for lunch.\"  After leaving Miami, Martin went home to California to be with his family. According to Fox Sports reporter Mike Garafalo, Martin remained in California today.  \"Martin shared texts and voice mails with his parents on Saturday, and turned them over Sunday to the Dolphins and the league, according to sources close to Martin and involved in the investigation,\" NFL News reports. \"The evidence implicates Incognito and, to a lesser extent, Dolphins center Mike Pouncey.  A transcript of a voice mail that has been circulating Monday describes an offensive and expletive-laden message, allegedly from Incognito. It also uses a racial slur and threatens violence.

The Miami Herald reports that if Martin was the target of hazing, he wasn't alone.  \"Incognito pressured Martin into paying $15,000 for an unofficial team vacation to Las Vegas \u2013 a trip that Martin didn't even join,\" the newspaper says. \"One young defensive player, whose privacy the Miami Herald is protecting, is on his way to going broke because he has been unable to say no to the older players, a source said.\"  As for what punishment the NFL might dole out if the current allegations are proven, Mike says, \"The commissioner, Roger Goodell, has leveled heavy fines and heavy suspensions for things that embarrass the league.

They've accused offensive lineman Richie Incognito of conduct detrimental to the team. This, after Incognito's fellow lineman Jonathan Martin abruptly left the team last week. Martin filed a complaint prompting the Dolphins and the NFL to investigate allegations of bullying and hazing. NPR's Mike Pesca joins me to talk about developments.  And Mike, there is news out of Miami today regarding some horrifying texts and voicemail messages that were reportedly sent from Richie Incognito to his teammate, Jonathan Martin. What can you tell us about them?  MIKE PESCA, BYLINE: Well, Jason La Canfora of CBS first disclosed the existence of these texts and email and Adam Schefter of ESPN then started tweeting the actual content. There were things like: I'm going to slap you. I'm going to kill you. Incognito allegedly then engaged in a bunch of racial slurs. So ugly, ugly stuff.  BLOCK: And before this, let's back up just a little bit. Before these messages were revealed, Jonathan Martin suddenly was absent from the team. How did the Dolphins explain what had happened?  PESCA: Right. A week, ago, Jonathan Martin leaves the Dolphins training facility. He is upset. He is said to have been the victim of a prank gone wrong, possibly in the cafeteria. The Miami Herald quotes a member of the team as saying that he snapped. Then, somehow, it comes out that perhaps this was bullying. Perhaps Richie Incognito was involved in bullying or hazing Martin.  There is a discussion. How can a 315-pound guy be bullied? But today, the revelation of these texts and more details about what actually happened changes this into a discussion if a large person can be bullied to, you know, where we are now, which is real harassment, you know, possibly criminal.  BLOCK: Mike, tell us a bit more about the background of the players involved here and in particular, Richie Incognito. This is not his first brush with trouble, either on or off the field, right?  PESCA: Right. Well, first of all, Jonathan Martin was heavily recruited. He went to Stanford. He was a classics major. He was considering going to Harvard. If he had gone, he would've been the first ever fourth generation African-American at Harvard. His great grandfather went there.  Incognito, on the other hand, he had to transfer schools. He was suspended and dismissed from every school he went to. Got in fights, voted NFL's dirtiest player. There's a long laundry list of things that he's done in terms of getting suspended, getting in trouble with the law.  BLOCK: And is it clear, Mike, that this is limited, this alleged hazing is limited to these two players we're talking about?  PESCA: All throughout the reporting of this, it was said that this was hazing perhaps by the offensive line against Jonathan Martin. There's so much that's unclear and the existence of these voicemails and texts, you know, if true, that seems to be more tangible. The other thing, the broader issue is the issue of hazing in the NFL.  And hazing goes on in the NFL, much more so than it does in a lot of other institutions, you know. There's anti-hazing rules on college campuses. You can't do it in the military. But in the NFL, a private enterprise, it's gone on and it's seen as a harmless thing, where rookies have to carry equipment, sometimes rookies are made to pay very large bills when the veterans go out to eat.  And every once in a while it boils up and a rookie objects and he's usually told, stop being a baby. Get with the program. And the argument that works in the NFL: We put up with it, you should put up with it. It toughens you up. And I think a lot of NFL teams, maybe they'll be called upon to question that practice, but they might not because in this instance, what's being alleged is so far beyond the pale, they might not even recognize any parallel to the hazing that goes on in their locker room.  BLOCK: So the alleged perpetrator has been suspended. The team is investigating. The league is investigating. Does the Player's Association get involved?  PESCA: Yeah, the Player's Association, it was at the behest of the Player's Association looking into this that the league got involved. But it's now being handled at a level higher than the team itself. There's no indication that Martin will come back, and we're going to have to wait to see what they do with Incognito.  In the past, the commissioner, Roger Goodell, has leveled heavy fines and heavy suspensions for things that embarrass the league. It's not hard to think that Roger Goodell will act upon this very fiercely.  BLOCK: Okay. NPR's Mike Pesca. Mike, thanks so much.  PESCA: You're welcome.  Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

The company adds those colorful, on-screen graphics to live sports events, like the virtual strike zone box that logs trajectory of a baseball pitch as it crosses the plate, the country flags magically hovering over America's Cup yachts and, of course, the company's best-known invention: football's first-down \"yellow line.\"  That's the line \u2014 trademark name Virtual Yellow 1st & Ten \u2014 that looks like it's painted on the field during game play. Sportvision debuted it with ESPN back in 1998.  \n    \n     \n  \n  \n\n  \n       The glowing hockey puck known as FoxTrax debuted during the National Hockey League All-Star game on Fox television in 1996. It wasn't a hit with fans, but it helped Sportvision develop its more successful football graphics. \n  \n  \n\n \n \n\n  'The Guys Who Draw The Yellow Line'  Adams has tried to describe his business in other terms, he tells All Things Considered host Audie Cornish, but \"in spite of everything else that we do, people keep coming back to that ... I try and then eventually just default to, 'Well, we're the guys who draw the yellow line.' \"  The company hatches all its technologies in Silicon Valley, in a Mountain View, Calif., lab staff call \"the war room.\" It's a giant warehouse space where you'll find stray football helmets trimmed with infrared lights pinning down piles of paper. TV cameras are mounted on high-rise platforms in the corners of the room.  The cameras are all trained toward the floor, a replica of an NFL field painted green and white. It's one-eighth of the actual size and would take about 10 strides to cover from end zone to end zone.  There are infrared and motion sensors in NFL stadiums around the country just like the ones around this model, and they all do the same thing: map and track everything on the field and send that data to Sportvision. Sportvision then creates a computer-generated graphic superimposed over the broadcast; in this case, a yellow line.  It's a lot like the so-called green-screen technology that your local TV weather team uses. But the Sportvision technology, Adams says, is a bit more sophisticated.  \"In football, it's not so easy, because it's grass and painted logos and football pads and pants that can get grass stains on them,\" Adams explains. \"It's a very tough thing for us, to distinguish between, say, the Green Bay Packers' green pants and the color of their field.\"  It's been a game of trial and error over the years, Adams says, to figure out how to perfect the technology.  \"For a graphical enhancement to work, it has to be something that's hard to see, happens a lot and is really important to the game,\" Adams says. \"And if we can meet those three criteria, it turns out to be very successful for us.\"  \n    \n     Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Sportvision uses helicopter and water-based platforms to superimpose the national flags of competing teams over broadcasts of the America's Cup sailing competitions. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Sportvision uses helicopter and water-based platforms to superimpose the national flags of competing teams over broadcasts of the America's Cup sailing competitions.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n That \"yellow line,\" for example, grew out of a technology hockey fans may remember: \"the famous, or infamous, glowing puck,\" Adams says.  Known as FoxTrax, the puck had electronics embedded inside that tracked its movement across the ice during live play. \"Some people loved it; some people hated it,\" Adams explains. After two years of use, NHL ratings were down and the puck was dropped.  \"For the hard-core hockey fan, they felt that it was over the top,\" Adams says. \"If we ever did it again, we'd be a lot more subtle about it; we'd do it in replay.\"  Next Up: Soccer. Maybe  It's easiest to come up with virtual enhancements like these for sports like football or NASCAR, because they provide lots of equipment to tack sensors to. It's not so simple for games with mostly bare skin and movement, like basketball or soccer.  That last sport holds particular appeal for the company, but the challenges for soccer go beyond the technical side.  \"As a businessperson, I'm obviously attracted to the thought of enhancing soccer, because it is the world's biggest sport, clearly. And from our perspective, there's been very little done to improve the quality of that broadcast. They have been doing the same way for 50 years in that sport,\" Adams says.  \"In fact, when we took our technology over and said, 'Hey, we can track the players and put virtual off-side markers and arrows down to certain players and show you things in real time,' the European broadcasters put their arms up and said, 'Oh, we are never going to do that crazy stuff you Americans do.' \"  But, Adams points out, people \"screamed and yelled and rebelled\" when a score box was first added to screens in the United Kingdom a couple of decades ago.  \"And lo and behold, now you can't see a game in any sport that doesn't have the live score on,\" Adams says. \"Now, of course, it's just the fabric of what we see. So I think [the soccer leagues'] attitudes are changing there as well.\"", "topics": [], "author": "NPR Staff, All Things Considered", "wordCount": 1045}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Kenyans Mutai, Jeptoo Win New York City Marathon", "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/11/03/242746797/5-things-to-know-about-the-new-york-city-marathon?ft=1&f=1055", "text": "This Post Was Last Updated At 12:06 p.m. ET.  \n    \n     \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya leads the New York City Marathon on Sunday. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n \n Two Kenyans running similarly tactical races came from behind to win the New York City Marathon on Sunday, marking the third time Kenyans have won both the men's and women's 26.2-mile road race.  Geoffrey Mutai, of Kenya, stayed pretty quiet for the first 20 miles. He nestled in the pack, shielding himself from the wind, then, as the toughest part of the race began, he accelerated past the pack and never looked back, winning the race in 2:08:24.  This means Mutai has won the New York City Marathon two times in a row. He won in 2011.  On the women's side, Priscah Jeptoo hung back until she passed Bizunesh Deba at mile 24, ending with a winning time of 2:25:07. Deba, who is Ethiopian, has been crowd favorite two races in a row, because she lives and trains in New York City. But like in 2011, she ended up in second place, about 40 seconds behind Jeptoo.  The race was run after what's been a traumatic year for the marathon world. First, Hurricane Sandy forced the cancellation of the 2012 New York City Marathon , one of the largest 26.2-mile road races in the world. And then in April, the Boston Marathon, the oldest and most prestigious marathon in the world, was rocked by twin blasts that killed three people and injured more than 200 .  Today, the elites ran through New York's five boroughs alongside some 45,000 amateur runners, who will make their way through the finish through the early afternoon.  Our Original Post Continues:  The previous year has been a tough one for the marathon world: First, Hurricane Sandy forced the cancellation of the 2012 New York City Marathon , one of the largest 26.2-mile road races in the world. And then in April, the Boston Marathon, the oldest and most prestigious marathon in the world, was rocked by twin blasts that killed three people and injured more than 200 .  Today, more than 45,000 runners are hitting New York's five boroughs, perhaps smoothing over some of that history.  We'll leave you with five things you should know about the race:  \u2014 After Boston, security is a huge concern . USA Today reports :   \"Instead of a discussion of record times, police and counterterrorism officials outlined a different set of numbers during a Friday news conference. The 1,500 security cameras along the route, 43 bomb-sniffing dogs, an unspecified number of NYPD scuba divers who will scan around the bridges, police helicopters, boats and surveillance towers, and hundreds of officers in uniform and plain clothes equipped with radiation detection gear along the route.\"   \u2014 It'll be cold (highs in the 50s) and windy. Accuweather says runners will face a 15-25 mph wind, which may be enough to hold back any potential challenge on the course record.  \u2014 Speaking of records, the Kenyans are the ones to watch . The New York Times reports :   \"The men's race will probably be led by Geoffrey Mutai, a Kenyan who won in 2011 by finishing in a course-record 2 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds, and Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia, who may be tired after his strong fourth-place performance in the marathon at the world track championships in August. The top American contender is Meb Keflezighi, 38, who won in 2009 but whose training for this year's race has been checkered with injuries.  \"Two Kenyans should lead the pack on the women's side, going after the decade-old course record of 2:22:31. Priscah Jeptoo has consistently been one of the world's top marathoners in recent years. She will be challenged by Edna Kiplagat, who won the marathon at the world championships in August. The Bronx resident Buzunesh Deba, an Ethiopian who finished second in the race in 2011, should be a front-runner as well.\"   \u2014 Another runner to watch: Yuki Kawauchi, a Japanese amateur who has a full-time job yet has managed to run a 2:08:37 marathon. That's blazingly fast \u2014 about a 4:54 pace for all 26.2 miles. Runner's World caught up with him in New York :   \"Despite the fact that he's now well established as one of Japan's best, and has won marathons in Egypt and Australia, Kawauchi isn't going to change that schedule. 'Each race I run, I learn something new and gain a new experience,' he said in New York on Friday through a translator.  \"'I do train by myself. Sometimes it's hard to push myself in the training,' he said, which means many of his races become akin to hard training runs without any taper. Kawauchi just plain doesn't think he overdoes it. He usually puts in one two-hour morning session 'compared with the corporate team runner who trains twice in a day.' For Kawauchi, 'the running and the job balance each other well.'  \"He's been called 'citizen runner' in the American media, but his Japanese translator said the epithet used is more akin to 'amateur runner.' Kawauchi points out, 'Except for the elite runner, most [runners] are like me, having a full-time job and running as well. They see me as just having a hobby. They consider me their mate.'\"   \u2014 The New York Times put together this cool video , detailing the race by the numbers :", "topics": [], "author": "Eyder Peralta", "wordCount": 880}, {"date": "2013-11-03 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Can A World Series Win Help Boston's Healing?", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=242736478&ft=1&f=1055", "text": "Sports commentators linked Boston's victory to the recovery from the Boston Marathon bombing. NPR's Mike Pesca is skeptical. He joins host Rachel Martin to talk about what the Red Sox game did and did not achieve for Boston. \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Time now for sports.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  MARTIN: Well, if you didn't see it live, you've probably heard it 100 times from all of the displaced Bostonians in your life - the Red Sox won the World Series last week. NPR's Mike Pesca was in Boston for the Series. He joins us now to talk about what the game did and didn't achieve for the great city of Boston. Good morning, Mike.  MIKE PESCA, BYLINE: Hello.  MARTIN: So, you were there at Fenway for the win and all the ensuing celebrations. And everywhere you turned in the aftermath, you heard people ascribing some bigger significance to this story and to the city of Boston.  PESCA: Right. And that's usual. Every time I've been to a championship game, a coach, the players, someone will make an assertion that this was more than the team that won the most games or the team that won the last games. We stand for something more. And usually that thing is a concept like teamwork or brotherhood or togetherness. And that's all true. I don't think that that's a lie. You can't really be at each other's throats and win a championship.  But in the Boston case, with the slogan Boston Strong, the team was said to have contributed to the healing of the city after the Boston Marathon. And, you know, I will say that the Red Sox, certainly they're a civic institution, they know that they have an important part to play in the city, the day of the marathon is Patriot's Day, the day of the Red Sox game. However, I just think it was too facile. I went home after the game, turned on the TV and they do sort of rolling coverage of the celebrations. The phrase over and over again, how much they helped the city heal and how important they were to the healing process. It was just presented so uncritically and without question, and I think that bears some scrutiny.  MARTIN: So, maybe healing isn't the right word, but can't something like this genuinely lift a city's spirits? I mean, it is just baseball but why not try to make it about something bigger? It seems like a worthy intention.  PESCA: It does. It does. I tweeted this and someone on Twitter said, you know, in 1968, there was a newspaper strike in Detroit and things were bad and the Tigers won and that made everyone feel good. I think that sports can definitely transcend sport and it could combat a general feeling of malaise. And certainly for the Bostonians who were two or three steps removed from victims, if they felt sympathy for the victims, or if they felt perhaps afraid in their lives, the Red Sox could provide something. Maybe it's just joy. Maybe it's taking your mind off it. I'm not questioning that.  But you have to think about the actual victims. I talked to a friend of me, Dr. Matt Sachs, who does two things. The first thing he does is he's a sports psychologist, so he can help you putt better. But the other thing he does, his main job, is he works with soldiers and airmen and Marines who are dealing with PTSD. And he says, you know, the trap that we fall into is that we generalize about what happens with victims. So, to say that they are healed is not always true. And then there is another effect. It is quite likely that just as the news is done, many stories on the person who was a victim of the Boston bombing and maybe they're going through therapy now, and, man, they love the Red Sox and the Red Sox give them hope or inspiration. But, you know, it's really quite likely that there are many people out there who are not going to do a news story on who feel terrible and they're struggling through this as, of course, they are. And maybe they don't care about the Red Sox, you know. And when they hear things like this, it makes them feel why am I not in the process that I'm told I should be? Why am I a couple of steps behind this supposedly healed city?  I would just think about the use of that word, as we media think about a lot of phrases, and really try not to overuse it and to prescribe magical qualities to a team that did great on the field and is a great team off the field too.  MARTIN: If not healing, do you have an alternative? What else would you say?  PESCA: Yeah. I think we could say the Red Sox gave the city joy. The Red Sox brought the city - helped bring the city through a hard time. The Red Sox helped us remember the victims. You know, my friend, Dr. Sachs, says that's really important. Victims don't want to be forgotten. And the Boston Red Sox certainly reminded everyone what happened. And that was all to the good and those were all actually tangible things that we could document that the Red Sox did.  MARTIN: OK. With that, do you have a curveball for us?  PESCA: I do. The Mexican national soccer team, they have to win two games against New Zealand or at least score more than New Zealand to get to the World Cup. So, what the coach of the team has decided to do is just not bring his best players back to play, because the best players are in Europe and the first game's going to be in Mexico City and he's worried about jetlag. A lot of people in the international community are saying aren't the best players still the best? But he's saying, ah, but jetlag, I think this is the idea of local sourcing gone haywire.  MARTIN: Jetlag is brutal.  PESCA: Apparently, yeah.  MARTIN: NPR's Mike Pesca. Thanks, Mike.  PESCA: You're welcome.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  MARTIN: You're listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.

Lloyd was a forward for the Washington Capitols who grew up in Virginia. He didn't break the league's color barrier (the New York Knicks' Wat Masaka, a Japanese-American point guard, beat him to it by a few years ), but it was a seminal moment for the league, which is now about 80-percent black.  We wanted to know what he was up to these days, and to our pleasant surprise and delight, the 85-year-old Lloyd happened to be at his home in Tennessee and up to talking for a few minutes.  Walk me through that first game. What was that like for you?  Well, to be honest, it was a walk in the park. I always say that if someone had to handpick a place to play their first game as a black player, it would be Rochester, N.Y. In that part of the country in the wintertime, no one hates anyone. You see black folks and white folks pushing each other's cars through the snow. But the next day we were in St. Louis. That was not a nice place to be in 1950. That was a not a nice place to be. But there was no Klansmen [at that first game] and all that, with signs and ropes. It was too cold for all that.  Do you remember how many points you had?  Six. I took three shots and had six points.  Three for three!  I figured I had a hell of a night.  So you weren't nervous at all as the league's first black player?  I had old coaches and teammates all over, I had my handprints everywhere. Every stop I made, there was some love waiting there for you. It didn't make things right, but it made them easier to deal with. ...  My mother called me one day, and she called me 'Earl Francis.' And when Southern people call you by your first name and your middle name, you know it was something serious. She said, 'are people still calling you [demeaning names]?' I said, 'Yes, ma'am.' And she said, 'Well, make them be quiet.' I said, 'Yes, ma'am!' So I did.  So why was your nickname was \"The Big Cat\"?  I really don't know where that came from. It just popped up. It made me a little nervous when they called me \"Big Cat\" because someone was going to slip and call me the \"The Big Black Cat.\"  I want you to think about this. A young black boy born Alexandria, Va. Back then. What kind of prospects do they have? None. Then I got inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.  Do you remember what you said in your speech?  I just said that there was a lot of people who were responsible for me being there. It was a little different than the one Michael Jordan made. [Ed note: The legendarily vengeful Jordan made a notoriously angry speech when he was inducted into the Hall, in which he rattled off the names of the people who he felt had wronged him.] How can you cut up your teammates and your coaches?  But I remember, the day I stepped onto the West Virginia State campus. It all changed.  We were just down in West Virginia at Bluefield State a couple of weeks ago. They were your rivals, right?   Oh, we played them, but they weren't rivals. Bluefield was always good for ending your losing streaks.  Next month, my school is going to name their court after me.  Really?  That's deep, man. It gets no better that, man.  So what did you do after you were done playing?   I went to work for the Dodge division of the Chrysler Corporation for about six or seven years. A friend of mine was the superintendent of schools in Detroit, and so I went there to work in voter education.  Did people there know who you were?  In Detroit? That was my town. See, people treat you differently if they think you think you're special. My parents used to say it only matters if other people think you're special. What you think is only as important as a rat's behind.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  SIMON: This week, the World Series was won, basketball began again and Serena Williams sure finished strong. Joining us now, Howard Bryant of ESPN.com and ESPN The Magazine, from the studios of New England Public Radio. Howard, thanks so much for being with us.  HOWARD BRYANT: Good morning, Scott.  SIMON: The Boston Red Sox have a World Series championship parade in Boston. How did they go from being a civic embarrassment to getting acclaimed as world champions?  BRYANT: Well, I think the first way they did it is because they weren't that far away while being an embarrassment. They were not a bad team last year. They had bad chemistry, they had a bad manager in Bobby Valentine. They simply did not perform the way they were supposed to, and they had injuries and such. And things began to snowball and I think that when you had a lot of players have their integrity questioned - and I always say never underestimate anybody who has something to prove.  As a collective, this team had a lot to prove. They had - you had David Ortiz who won the MVP of the World Series and Dustin Pedroia, and these guys who were proud guys. They've won championships before. David Ortiz now has three championships. And they didn't like being a laughing stock, losing 93 games, being a last place, bottom-feeding team. And I think they came out this year, and it's really hard to do in baseball, to be focused for eight, nine, ten months, and they came out and did it and now it's duck boats for everybody in Boston.  (LAUGHTER)  SIMON: Yeah. And it was a great World Series to watch. Let me ask you about the start of the NBA season because the Miami Heat are sputtering a little.  BRYANT: Yeah, they've lost two out of three games, goodness, and there's only 82 - there's only 79 games left. What are they going to do? You know Scott, the big deal with the Miami Heat is can anybody beat them four times when spring comes? That's the number one question. And I think they're going to be there. They're the two-time defending world champions, they've got the best player in the world in LeBron James.  The real issue is going to be those secondary teams. You've got a great game last night with the Boston Celtics South in the Brooklyn Nets with Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett out there and they played a great game. They beat Miami last night, 101 to 100, and you've got Kevin Durant out in Oklahoma City and you've got Derrick Rose and your...  SIMON: Yeah, thank you.  BRYANT: ...Chicago Bulls are back, and the Indiana Pacers.  All of these teams believe it's their time. All of them believe that they're close. All of them believe that they can compete with LeBron and Miami. Now it's time to prove it and I think the fun part of this NBA season is going to be which one of those teams actually walks the walk.  SIMON: Football question. Jonathan Martin has reportedly left the Miami Dolphins because of bullying. A lot of speculation that's available in the news today. What do we know?  BRYANT: It's a bizarre case. What you've had is Jonathan Martin, the lineman for the Miami Dolphins, and left the team allegedly due to bullying, and the NFL and the players' association now is investigating whether some teammates were bullying him after a loss and trying to figure out just what is behind the culture of the locker room and what allegations are true and why the players did what - why he did what he did.  I always made somewhat of a joke when I used to say that when you cover sports you are immediately propelled back into the eighth grade when you go into the locker room, and now it seems like it's really not that funny. It's going to be very interesting to see what they come up with, and let's face it, the macho culture of that room can do a lot to a lot of people. This is one of the first times you've heard somebody come forward though.  SIMON: We ought to note: Serena Williams ends this part of the tennis season at a record 78 and 4. Oh, my gosh. What are we seeing there?  BRYANT: First woman ever to win $12 million. Only Novak Djokovic has done it on the men's side. She's playing for history right now. She's by far the best player. Eight-two matches, won 78 of them, 17 majors. She's behind, one behind Chrissie and one behind Martina. She's going after Steffi Graf's 22, and you can tell that Serena is making up for injuries and making up for those years where it looked like maybe she wasn't as motivated.  Now, you're seeing the full force of what she can do. She is the best player and if you love tennis, if you love sports, watch because you're missing something great if you don't.  SIMON: Howard Bryant, thanks so much.  BRYANT: My pleasure.  Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR. All rights reserved.

ANDREW PAULSON: Thank you.  SIMON: What's your game plan to recapture the glory days of Fischer versus Spassky?  PAULSON: Well, I think what I remember most clearly from my childhood, which inspires me in transforming chess into a spectator sport is having a radio under my pillow and listening to the Orioles games in Baltimore. Here in England, I try and remind people of listening to cricket on the radio. These were enormously popular ways of consuming sports, and you didn't really need to see anything. You have the same thing with chess. If you happen to have a computer at hand, you get brilliant new data visualization, which allows you to see with the eyes of a grandmaster. So, it's not at all the sort of paint-drying experience that you imagine.  SIMON: How do you hope to get people who don't care so deeply about chess or might even not know how the game is played except the vaguely know that a checkmate is something good and the king is something that you aspire to be on the board. How do you get them interested?  PAULSON: Well, we don't probably. And I don't think it really matters. We hired a great media research company and we came to the amazing conclusion there are more people in America who play chess regularly now than there are people who play tennis and golf.  SIMON: But to point out the obvious: the play chess, they don't watch it.  PAULSON: Who would ever in a million years have imagined that anyone would be interested in watching golf on TV? In our poll, golf is considered the most boring sport in America and yet it's incredibly successful on TV. It is indeed considered, in this poll, more boring than chess. But if you think about it, if you know anything about chess, you know that there's a rich, thick history, both of players and personalities and madness and theory that you can talk about on and on and on and on. There's nothing to talk about in golf.  SIMON: Andrew Paulson speaking with us from London. Thank you very much. Good luck to you and to chess, Mr. Paulson.  PAULSON: Thank you very much.

Or you can play fantasy sports, managing players based on their real-life statistics. And now, Wall Street has come along with a way to buy a stake in an athlete's performance. The public will be able to buy stock in at least two NFL players, sort of.  Sportswriter Stefan Fatsis joins us now, as he does most Fridays, to explain this. Hi, Stefan.  STEFAN FATSIS: Hey, Robert.  SIEGEL: Yesterday, a company called Fantex announced its second planned public offering in an athlete: Vernon Davis, a star tight end with the San Francisco 49ers. A few weeks ago, it cut a similar deal with running back Arian Foster of the Houston Texans. Explain how this works.  FATSIS: Well, Fantex is a start-up backed by Wall Street and Silicon Valley executives. It's a year old. It's losing money. The basic idea is that it will pay athletes a lump sum in exchange for a percentage of their future sports-related income: playing contracts, endorsement deals, broadcasting deals.  Fantex says it's agreed to pay Foster $10 million for 20 percent of his earnings and Davis $4 million for 10 percent of his. In return, Fantex said it's going to help manage the athletes' brand. But the part of the arrangement that's gotten the most attention involves selling shares in Foster's and Davis' brand to the public.  SIEGEL: So, selling stock in Arian Foster and Vernon Davis, which I imagine is where Fantex plans to get the $14 million to pay the players.  FATSIS: Yeah, exactly. These deals don't happen unless Fantex raises the money from investors, better known as fans. The fans then would be buying what's called a convertible tracking stock, which will trade on a closed proprietary market run by Fantex itself. As the value of the brand changes, the stock should rise and fall. Investors buy and sell. But there are a whole lot of caveats.  SIEGEL: I bet. I don't think we have enough time for all the caveats...  FATSIS: No, we don't.  SIEGEL: ...but why don't you give us a sample?  FATSIS: Well, for the Arian Foster deal, the company filed a 150-page offering with the SEC. Thirty-seven of those pages detailed risk factors. And here are just a couple. There might not be any liquidity in this market. Or the value of Arian Foster's brand might vanish. The website thestreet.com took a look. It concluded that investors wouldn't be investing in Arian Foster at all but rather in Fantex.  And that's because under the terms of this deal, shares in Arian Foster or Vernon Davis or any other athlete can be converted to common shares of this company, Fantex, whenever the company wants to. So investors won't own a piece of Foster's or Davis' brand but instead would own shares in Fantex.  SIEGEL: Well, using, say, the numbers that you had for the Foster deal, could the players actually earn enough money so that the company makes a profit from this investment?  FATSIS: I don't see how that's possible. Foster needs to earn $50 million to make this earn money for Fantex. He's due 25 million more on his contract. It expires at the end of 2016. He might not make it to the end of that contract. And the odds of another team giving him 25 million at the age of 30 are near zero. He's a smart guy, a marketable guy. But his endorsement deals aren't going to be worth that much money, especially after he retires.  SIEGEL: Yeah. If I were investing in NFL football players, I wouldn't buy a running back, given the risk of injury. I'd buy a quarterback who might become a superstar.  FATSIS: Might become a superstar. And if you're that quarterback's agent, you have to be very, very careful about committing 10 or 20 percent of this player's future earnings to a company when he, in fact, might become the next Peyton Manning, who can earn millions of dollars from TV commercials and endorsements, not to mention tens of millions of dollars from playing the game.  SIEGEL: But do I understand that if I - if this deal existed and I could have bought, say, Troy Aikman when he was a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, I'd still be collecting from his salary as a commentator on NFL games?  FATSIS: I'm reading right now from the Securities and Exchange Commission offering that this company has filed in the Arian Foster deal, and it says that the brand contract is intended to be effected in perpetuity.  SIEGEL: Proof right there that sports, Stefan, is stranger than news.  FATSIS: And that's why we talk about it so much.  SIEGEL: Every Friday. That's Stefan Fatsis.  Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.

The football teams of Garfield High School and Roosevelt High School will meet on the gridiron Friday night for the 79th year. The game is expected to draw 20,000 fans. \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2013 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.  When it comes to high school football, rivalries between schools can be as drama-filled as the games themselves. In a few hours, two teams in East Los Angeles will go head-to-head in one of the country's biggest showdowns. NPR's Shereen Marisol Meraji introduces us to this decades-old rivalry.  SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, BYLINE: Tonight's game is the biggest of the season for the Roosevelt Rough Riders...  UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Riders right on three. Riders right on three. One, two, three.  UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #1: Rough Riders.  MERAJI: ...and Garfield Bulldogs...  UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #2: Garfield Bulldogs, yay, team.  MERAJI: ...drawing more than 20,000 fans to the East LA City College's football stadium.  FRANKLIN RIVAS: When I was growing up, they used to call it the Chili Bowl, the Menudo Bowl, the Bean Bowl. They called it a lot of different things.  MERAJI: Franklin Rivas, Garfield class of '73 and former Garfield football coach. He says the game got those not-so-nice nicknames because it's set in a working-class Hispanic neighborhood. The players, the cheerleaders, the fans - almost all Latino.  JAVIER CID: Oh, 99.9 percent.  MERAJI: That's Javier Cid, Roosevelt class of '84 and current coach of the Roosevelt Rough Riders. He said calling it the Chili Bowl just wasn't right. So...  Roosevelt and Garfield got together and they said, hey, you know, we have got something special here. Why don't we give it a name? And it just became known as the East LA Classic.  Everything that happens on the field tonight is a competition. Football...  UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: One, two, three.  UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #3: Move.  MERAJI: ...cheerleading...  UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #4: Let's go.  MERAJI: ...and band.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Are you ready for the classic?  UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #5: Yes, sir.  MERAJI: Competition is so fierce couples won't sit together tonight if one went to Roosevelt and the other to Garfield. Families split up for the game. Roosevelt cheerleader Jeanette Gomez comes from a Garfield family.  JEANETTE GOMEZ: For the most part, they all go to the Garfield side. My mom, my dad and my very close family, they stay toward the Roosevelt side, even though deep down I know they're rooting for Garfield.  MERAJI: How many tickets are you buying?  JOB GUTIERREZ: I'm buying four right now, and I'll be back for some more. But I want to make sure that I have mine.  MERAJI: Job Chico Gutierrez came to buy tickets at his alma mater for tonight's game. His grown children are coming, too.  GUTIERREZ: Some of them are in Yakima in the state of Washington, and the others are in Bakersfield. But they'll be here tonight.  MERAJI: Gutierrez graduated from Garfield in 1952.  GUTIERREZ: I'm a bulldog.  (LAUGHTER)  GUTIERREZ: Once a Bulldog, you're always a Bulldog.  MERAJI: And once a Rough Rider, always a Rough Rider.  ELIZABETH GINSBURG: I was a student at Roosevelt High School from 1939 to 1942.  MERAJI: That's Elizabeth Ginsburg. She went to Roosevelt when East Los Angeles was home to LA's Jewish and Japanese-American communities. Cesar Chavez Avenue used to be Brooklyn Avenue. Today's taquerias were yesteryear's Jewish delis. But Ginsburg says one thing hasn't changed, that Garfield-Roosevelt rivalry. And to make her point, she reads a passage from a book about LA's Jewish history.  GINSBURG: One season, Garfield covered Roosevelt's school buildings with Garfield colors. This totally incensed all the students at Roosevelt and we wanted retribution. Soon, the biggest rumble was planned. And it's in an article by Lenny D. Davis entitled \"East L.A.\"  MERAJI: No one really knows how the rivalry started. The two high schools were built within a couple years and miles of each other in the '20s, and they both served a working-class, heavily immigrant part of LA.  GINSBURG: Life was really hard. To earn a living was difficult. So, if you can find an area where you are on top, you are victorious, it is very heartwarming.  MERAJI: Victory tonight means bragging rights in the neighborhood and at every single sporting event Roosevelt and Garfield play against each other until they do it all over again next year.

The country has produced the world's best distance runners for decades, and most belong to the Kalenjin people.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Kenyan Wilson Kipsang won this year's Berlin Marathon in 2 hours, 3 minutes and 23 seconds \u2014 an average of 4:42 per mile. It was easily the fastest marathon time ever recorded, an incredible feat for another powerful Kenyan runner.  But perhaps equally remarkable was that his fellow Kenyans also came in second, third, fourth and fifth place in this major international race. On the women's side, Kenyans placed first, second and fourth.  Two weeks later in Chicago, Kenyan runner Dennis Kimetto broke the course record there \u2014 after only having run for four years. Next in line behind him? Three more Kenyans.  \"If you look at it statistically, it sort of becomes laughable,\" says David Epstein, senior editor at Sports Illustrated and author of the new book The Sports Gene .  He says that while we tend to think of Kenyans as really good distance runners, all these runners are actually from the same tribe of Kenyans known as the Kalenjin. They number around 5 million, making them a small minority, even in Kenya, yet they dominate most of the world's long-distance races.  \"There are 17 American men in history who have run under 2:10 in the marathon,\" Epstein says. \"There were 32 Kalenjin who did it in October of 2011.\"  The Role Of Genetics  Scientists and sports gurus have proposed all sorts of explanations over the years for Kalenjin prowess on the track : from their high-starch diet, to the altitude, to socioeconomics.  All those factors are important, but none of them explain why this particular tribe is so dominant. That left Epstein when he was writing his book exploring a more controversial line of inquiry: Is there something genetically different about the Kalenjin that makes them superior runners?  \n    \n     Enlarge image   i \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Kenya's Wilson Kipsang set a world marathon record when he won the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 29 in 2 hours, 3 minutes and 23 seconds. He is Kalenjin, a group that has produced many of the world's best distance runners. \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n     \n       Kenya's Wilson Kipsang set a world marathon record when he won the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 29 in 2 hours, 3 minutes and 23 seconds. He is Kalenjin, a group that has produced many of the world's best distance runners.    \n   \n   \n\n  \n  \n\n \n Asking that question almost convinced Epstein to back out of his book contract. He realized he'd have to address sensitive questions of ethnic and racial differences. Academics told him they had evidence of genetic advantage but wouldn't share their research with him for fear they'd lose their jobs. \"And these were professors with tenure,\" he says.  But some scientists did talk to him; and they explained one aspect of innate biology that clearly helps Kalenjin: the shape of their bodies.  Kalenjin have particularly thin ankles and calves, a body build common to Nilotic tribes who grow up near the equator. Epstein says this is particularly important in running because your leg is like a pendulum. The more weight you have farther away from your center of gravity, the more difficult it is to swing.  If you take a runner and put 8 pounds of weight around his waist, he can still run reasonably well. But if you put those same 8 pounds in the form of two 4-pound weights around his ankles, that will take much more energy and slow him down considerably.  Epstein says body type confers its greatest advantage among elite athletes, where other differences \u2014 in training, in aerobic capacity \u2014 are minimal. In fact, he says if you were to go to the Olympic starting line and measure everyone's ankles and calves before the race, you could predict, statistically, who's likely to win.  Or Is It 'Mental Toughness'?  Of course, when many of us turn on the Olympics we want to feel that we're watching more than a contest of physics or physical destiny.  Consider the famous 1,500-meter upset in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.  Kalenjin runner Kipchoge Keino defeated world-record holder Jim Ryun. That day Keino not only won gold, but he also ushered in an era of Kenyan dominance.  The amazing thing is that doctors had ordered Keino not to run the race at all. He'd been diagnosed with a gallbladder infection just a few days before. A gallbladder infection is incredibly painful. It hurts the most when you breathe hard, when you're running. Keino not only won the race, but he also set the Olympic record.  How did he push through so much pain?  John Manners thinks he can explain. He's a retired journalist who for a long time had a specialty in covering the exploits of African runners. Now he runs a nonprofit, KenSAP , that helps place academically gifted Kalenjin kids into Ivy League schools.  When Manners was 12 years old, he lived for a while in Kalenjin country, where his dad was an anthropologist. And as a boy, Manners noticed his friends had scars on their arms and legs where they'd burned themselves with hot coals.  The Initiation Ceremony  Manners soon learned that they were practicing for an initiation ceremony, a rite of passage that is all about enduring pain.  Elly Kipgogei, 19, remembers going through the ceremony at age 15.  First, he says, he had to crawl mostly naked through a tunnel of African stinging nettles. Then he was beaten on the bony part of the ankle, then his knuckles were squeezed together, and then the formic acid from the stinging nettle was wiped onto his genitals.  But all that was just warm-up; early one morning he was circumcised, with a sharp stick. \n \n\n During this whole process \u2014 the crawling, the beatings and the cutting \u2014 Kipgogei was obliged to be absolutely stoical, unflinching.  He could not make a sound. \n \n\n Indeed, in some versions of this ceremony, mud is caked on the face and then the mud is allowed to dry. If a crack appears in the mud \u2014 your cheek may twitch, your forehead may crinkle \u2014 you get labeled a kebitet \u2014 a coward \u2014 and stigmatized by the whole community.  Manners says that this enormous social pressure placed on your ability to endure pain is actually great training for a sport like running where \"pushing through pain\" is so fundamental to success.  \"Circumcision,\" he says, \"teaches kids to withstand pressure and tolerate pain.\"  Manners says he thinks there's a distinct advantage conferred on athletic kids who grow up in a pain-embracing society, as opposed to a Western, pain-avoiding one.  It's not a silver bullet. Any athletic success has to be ascribed to a host of factors including body type and diet and socioeconomics and upbringing. Nevertheless, in traditional Kalenjin society, pushing through pain isn't only a desired trait, it's also part of what makes you a man or a woman.  Modernization Of The Kalenjin  After Kipgogei was circumcised, he wasn't allowed to go home. He was taken to a hut on the outskirts of the village to heal from the operation and he was told, whenever you leave this hut, you are not allowed to walk.  \"So you're supposed to run and it's very fast. So you're running very swift, having the pain,\" he said.  Before the circumcision, Kipgogei was never a runner. Afterward, when he was done with initiation and back in high school, he decided to give it a try.  \"So I could run and I'd feel pain. I feel pain. I'm feeling pain and I'd wanted to stop,\" Kipgogei said. \"Then I realized, no. Let me try to persevere. Let me just try. Let me try one more, one more, one more time and two minutes later I'm at school.\"  Kipgogei is now the fastest runner on his track team. In Kalenjin country, that's pretty fast.  He acknowledges he might have had a natural talent for the sport. His mom was one of the fastest runners in Kalenjin country, back in her day. She, like many Kalenjin girls, went through a painful initiation rite of her own that also demanded stoicism \u2014 female genital mutilation.  Manners says that in traditional Kalenjin belief, Kipgogei got two things from his mother. One was physical prowess, his speed on the track. The other was a mental ability to withstand pain.  But Kipgogei is part of a new Kalenjin generation that's challenging old ways of doing things. He says when he has kids, his sons will be circumcised pain-free in a hospital. His daughters won't go through any such procedure at all.  Kipgogei told himself that he can pass on the Kalenjin values without resorting to the ancient rituals.  \"I believe perseverance you can get though many ways. Not necessarily through circumcision,\" he says. \"I will teach [my children] how to persevere.\"  And he says his kids will still be able to be champion runners \u2014 if that's what they choose to be.", "topics": [], "author": "Gregory Warner, All Things Considered", "wordCount": 1519}, {"date": "2013-11-01 00:00:00", "domain": "www.npr.org", "title": "Can We Compare Allen Iverson To Muhammad Ali?", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=242358466&ft=1&f=1055", "text": "The Boston Red Sox win the World Series and basketball bad boy Allen Iverson officially retires.

Now it's time for our weekly visit to the Barbershop where the guys talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. Sitting in the chairs for a shape-up this week are writer Jimi Izrael with us from Cleveland. Joining us from Boston, healthcare consultant and contributor to National Review magazine, Dr. Neil Minkoff. Here in our Washington, D.C. studios, Dave Zirin. He is sports editor at The Nation. And Corey Dade is a contributing editor for The Root. Take it away Jimi.  JIMI IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. Hey everybody.  COREY DADE: What up.  DAVE ZIRIN: Jimi Izrael...  IZRAEL: Welcome to the shop. How we doing?  ZIRIN: ...From the Cleve.  DADE: Jimi, what up, though?  IZRAEL: Yeah. The land of the Cleve, bro. We're making it work.  ZIRIN: Somehow.  IZRAEL: Right. Right. I think that should be the city motto. Welcome to Cleveland. We're making it work.  (LAUGHTER)  NEIL MINKOFF: I like it.  ZIRIN: Welcome to Cleveland. It could be worse.  IZRAEL: Awe. Hey, listen. I got to live - I got to live here. Wait a second. Let's calm down. Dr. Neil, I want to give you room, though, to, you know, get some bragging rights off, you know. To start us off here.  MARTIN: Do we have to?  IZRAEL: You know, we have to. Let's drop that tape. Go ahead.  (SOUNDBITE OF WORLD SERIES)  JOE BUCK: It hasn't happened at Fenway Park for 95 years. The Red Sox are world champions.  IZRAEL: Oh, Dr. Neil, can Red Sox haters - can they all now just stay in the dugout?  MINKOFF: Well, I mean, here's the thing that cracks me up - you know, my son is 11 and he thinks this is totally normal. My son thinks it's a shame that there hasn't been a championship parade in Boston for almost a year and a half. What's going on? Dad how is this happening? And so this has become, like, the new normal here and we are going to be in for such a fall someday. It's really scary.  MARTIN: Soon, we hope. Sorry, I'm from New York.  IZRAEL: D.Z. Dave Zirin.  MARTIN: Sorry, I'm from New York. Sorry.  ZIRIN: Yeah, I'm from New York too, and there is a small child in a Mets hat living in my brain somewhere that's crying. But, I have to say, it was hard for me not to get in the spirit and feel it. I mean, the first time a World Series-clinching win in Fenway Park in 95 years. And that's what's so amazing about baseball is the way it connects us with the past in such a profound way. I mean, 95 years ago, you know what the biggest issue was in this country? Spanish flu. That's what people were dealing with 95 years ago.  DADE: It's true.  ZIRIN: And yet, the game is largely the same. And 95 years later, Boston is able to experience this again. It's an amazing thing, even if some of those beards look like Hasidic minstrelsy. I do...  MARTIN: He said that. I didn't say that. I didn't say that. He said that.  ZIRIN: I do have some issues. But...  MARTIN: He said - but you were pointing out in your piece that the NFL and the NBA didn't even exist in 1918.  ZIRIN: Right.  MARTIN: So it's kind of like this is direct link.  ZIRIN: And that's the amazing thing about baseball is that connects us with our past, but it also represents change. I mean, folks probably know the Boston Red Sox were the last team to integrate in Major League Baseball - really defined itself by its whiteness until 1959. And now, here's the team led by a remarkable Japanese relief pitcher and an amazing Dominican slugger, and that's who the city is cheering for.  IZRAEL: Oh, are we post-racial yet? Corey Dade...  ZIRIN: No. No. Why you got to do that?  IZRAEL: You know what? Corey - Corey, you know what? For me, I was so surprised that only nine fans got arrested. You know, during the celebration afterwards, you know, something like this - if Cleveland won the World Series, let me just tell you, beer would flow from every spigot in the city and Mayor Frank White - I mean, Frank Jackson.  (LAUGHTER)  ZIRIN: He said...  IZRAEL: Frank Jackson would run naked through the city of Cleveland. He would run right - Cleveland, New York. Mayor Frank Jackson would run naked through the city if that happened. What do you think about all this, Corey Dade?  MARTIN: Are we heading to a point here? I was going to say, are we heading to a point?  DADE: You know, Boston...  IZRAEL: It just seems like there wasn't enough celebration.  DADE: Well, you know, Boston fans, I mean, at this point, they've been here before. So they know how act right. They know how to celebrate without getting arrested. I mean, you know, knock on wood. But you know, I guess, on a serious note, what's interesting is it's, you know, this is, you know, capping, you know, a difficult year for Boston after the bombings. So when they have that parade, when it goes down Boylston Street, that parade is going to pass the site of the Boston bombings. And that's going to be a very powerful moment for this city.  MARTIN: That's a good point.  IZRAEL: Wow.  MARTIN: That's a good point.  DADE: Sorry to be a downer.  MARTIN: No. No.  MINKOFF: So serious.  IZRAEL: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's...  MARTIN: 'Cause my Mets hat is never far from my head and so that's a good point.  ZIRIN: I'll make another beard joke or something.  MARTIN: All right so let's - all right. Go. Move it on.  IZRAEL: Let's take it to - let's take the ball to the court. The NBA kicked off their season this week, but one guy said, you know what? It's time to move on. That would be A.I. - Allen Iverson, best known for his time as a Philadelphia 76er. He formally - as if - he formally announced his retirement on Wednesday and he talked about his best career moment. Can we drop that clip?  MARTIN: Sure.  (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)  ALLEN IVERSON: Just getting the opportunity - somebody coming from where I come from, you know, I heard all the stories. You know, nobody makes it from Newport News or Hampden to the NBA. You know, my mom always told me I could be anything that I wanted to be and I truly, actually believed it.  IZRAEL: Yes, yes he did, ladies and gentleman. And Iverson, you know, he was the guy people loved to hate. He sounds a lot different there than back in the heyday. Remember this?  (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)  IVERSON: We talking about practice, not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it's my last. Not the game. We're talking about practice, man. I mean, how silly is that?  IZRAEL: How silly indeed. That's from a 2002 press conference when reporters dogged him about not showing up for practice. Dave Zirin?  MARTIN: Wasn't there a t-shirt, though, that people were selling for a while that said, are we talking about practice?  DADE: Everything. There was everything.  MARTIN: Do you remember that?  MINKOFF: Bumper stickers.  MARTIN: I think I may have had one.  ZIRIN: It's the late 20th century version of give me liberty or give me death.  DADE: That's right.  ZIRIN: Slogan for a nation. Look, I think Alan Iverson is by far, the most important, culturally significant athlete of his generation - going all in on that. To me, we're talking about practice, seriously, is a version of Mohammed Ali saying, I don't have to be what you want me to be in the 1960s. Before Alan Iverson, every young, African-American athlete felt like they had to be like the child of Michael Jordan - Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter. This idea that we have to button up, wear a suit, play a certain kind of corporate game and leave your emotions back at your house. Alan Iverson played with it all out on his sleeve and forced the broader culture to confront a certain kind of African-American man as a human being who, otherwise, they might even cross the street to avoid.  MARTIN: Corey?  IZRAEL: So he's like the Mike Tyson of the NBA. I mean, essentially, he did it his way and then he came kind of crashing to earth. You know, he kind of ends his career as a cautionary tale. That's what it sounds like to me, Dave.  ZIRIN: Well, I think he's going to end his career as the best, small scorer in the history of the National Basketball Association.  IZRAEL: Neil Minkoff, what do you think about all this? You know, during his press conference, he seemed to kind of apologize for being a young hothead. Has he finally found the answer?  MINKOFF: Yeah. Oh, the answer, nice one.  IZRAEL: Thank you.  MINKOFF: To me, one of the things that I think is really interesting here is the way we take young people who are reasonably immature and stick them in these positions where the limelight is on them and they have press conferences where they can be hotheads and they can say things. And then as they mature, they start to realize that maybe that wasn't the right way to go or maybe I could've been - but that's just a natural outcropping of what happens when you put a 20-year-old in that kind of position. And so we don't do that in any other walk of life and yet, we take all of these utterances like they're so serious, when we wouldn't listen to any other 20-year-old in the same way.  IZRAEL: Indeed. Corey Dade, are you an A.I. fan?  DADE: I am. I saw him - the first time I saw him was in a Georgetown basketball summer league. That dude sprained his ankle at half court, went out for one play and then came out next play and banged it on somebody. He got vertical with the ground. OK. I was like, OK. He's the truth. This is the answer. He's coming. But I will say - and, you know, I got to go against Dave on this one point. The idea that we're comparing him to Mohammed Ali - we need to be careful with that because the difference between the two is that Mohammed Ali's sort of self-possession was based on religious conviction and a certain social consciousness. In Ivo's case, it wasn't any of that. It was let me be me just because I want to be me. And if it's destructive to my team, if it's destructive to myself, so be it.  ZIRIN: I agree with Corey.  DADE: And I will say the bigger - the one thing that's interesting, this is symbolic because, to me, this is the end of an era. This the end of an era of the basketball star as a thug - and not in a good way, not in a bad way. It's just an observation. Today's players are like this refined byproduct. So they have Ivo's street credibility and toughness, but Michael Jordan's marketability. You know, simply put, it's no longer cool to be a thug in the NBA.  ZIRIN: Let me just, real quick - is that I agree with what Corey said, except I would just add that, you know, Mohammed Ali, when he was Cassius Clay, his dream was to bring the showmanship of professional wrestling into boxing. It was really the '60s that shaped him. Allen Iverson did not have the '60s. He had the '90s - a reflection of his era, just as Ali was a reflection of the '60s. But both had that kind of individualism, and I don't have to be who you want me to be, which I think is important sometimes...  IZRAEL: That's true.  ZIRIN: ...To move the culture forward.  MARTIN: All right. I will point out, though, that Ali and Tyson both won titles...  DADE: Ouch.  MARTIN: ...And Iverson never did. No, I mean, but that's the game. It is, but...  ZIRIN: But in an individual sport...  DADE: But it's a team sport. Team sport.  ZIRIN: Team sport.  MARTIN: It is a team sport, but I do credit - I mean, I do want to sort of co-sign with what Dr. Neil had to say about the idea that, you know, in what other area of life do we treat these people like oracles?  MINKOFF: That's right.  MARTIN: I mean, if I hear one more person say, well, I get to use the N-word because I heard some young rapper do - I say, well, when you start taking investment advice from him, I'll be interested in, you know...  DADE: Wow,  MARTIN: ...In what they have to say.  DADE: Nice.  MARTIN: I mean, so since when are these, like, the oracles of the universe and we have to hang on their every word as if they - you know, as if they are...  MINKOFF: And that's a cultural issue.  MARTIN: I'm just saying. That is. If you're just joining us, we're having our weekly conversation in the Barbershop. We're joined by writer Jimi Izrael, sports editor Dave Zirin, journalist Corey Dade and healthcare consultant Neil Minkoff. Back to you, Jimi.  IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. You know, speaking of oracles, you know, before we move far from the NBA, I've got to mention, Shaquille O'Neal is giving political ups these days. He's got a new gig. He's stumping for New Jersey governor, Chris Christie. Check this out.  (SOUNDBITE OF COMMERCIAL)  O'NEAL: Governor Christie's provided more funding for schools, given parents more choices on what schools their kids can go to and merit pay for good teachers. He's a good man. Excuse me, he's a great man. Please join me in supporting Chris Christie for governor.  IZRAEL: Wow. I guess he could be selling used cars instead. But, you know, it kind of sounds like he added that last bit on, you know, the whole bit about, for governor. I thought maybe he was running for president. But I tell you, it brings a tear to my eye nonetheless. C-Dade, Corey, what is this about? Does Christie need Shaq to carry water or a ball for him? What's up with that?  DADE: Yeah, Shaq Fu, you know, Shaq Fu has always been into all kinds of things, and politics I guess is the next thing for him. But, you know, he doesn't need him. I mean, you know, it's really about a gubernatorial race that's really about setting him up for the presidential run. I mean, here's the thing that's interesting. There's polls that show that, you know, Christie has about 36 percent support among African-Americans in New Jersey.  And to me, the fact that he has Shaquille O'Neal, the fact that he has this kind of support among African-Americans, you know, that could be, you know, a problem for Democrats in 2016. If you have a moderate Republican who can get that kind of black support, when Obama is no longer on the Democratic ticket, who's going to hold that black and Latino voting coalition together? So I think Christie may be onto something that might be interest. He might be able to take just enough black support out of this race to roll it forward in four years. We'll see what happens, but it's interesting.  MARTIN: And maybe it's a two-way street because Shaquille O'Neal is clearly interested in a life beyond basketball. I mean, he had a very long career.  ZIRIN: Oh, he's living it.  MARTIN: He's living it.  DADE: He is living it.  MARTIN: He had a very long career, but he's always been interested in some form of public service. Remember, he was like an honorary sheriff for a minute, like that. He's done kids' book. He's done all kinds of things.  ZIRIN: Yeah.  DADE: Oh, he's a sworn law-enforcement officer, which is scary.  MARTIN: Yeah.  ZIRIN: Yeah.  IZRAEL: Not to mention...  MARTIN: Dave...  IZRAEL: Not to mention that he makes a tasty beverage - Soda Shaq.  ZIRIN: Yeah. Yeah.  MARTIN: Dave.  ZIRIN: Yeah. People can Google Shaquille O'Neal and his honorary work as a police officer and see some of the complaints that were levied against him if they want interest in some of the less, shall we say, socially conscious aspect of Shaq's life with a badge. But I would say, look, my problem with Shaquille O'Neal is less that he's supporting a governor who's presiding over a state that has the highest poverty rate that New Jersey's seen in 50 years, and trying to pawn that off as that's progress. My problem is more that Shaquille O'Neal has taking the greatest show on television, \"Inside the NBA\" with Ernie, Chuck and Kenny Smith and put a fork in the back of this show.  IZRAEL: Ohhh.  ZIRIN: I mean, it's like a gourmet pizza with Shaquille O'Neal soy cheese on top. I mean, it's - so that's my bigger problem with Shaquille O'Neal.  IZRAEL: Dr. Neil.  MINKOFF: Yeah, so I think that one of the things that you see here - and it goes along with that high approval rate in the minority, or relatively high approval rate in the minority community compared to other Republican candidates - is that Christie stands out because, even if you don't agree with him, people think he's authentic and they believe what he's saying. I was in New Jersey earlier this week and I heard that over and over again. Even when I disagree with the guy, I think that he means what he says. And in some ways, he's a very, very different person, but he is maybe the best natural communicator and speaker on the GOP front since maybe Reagan.  (CROSSTALK)  IZRAEL: I totally agree with that.  MARTIN: Let me just ask Corey this. So why is it that the high-profile black athletes who tend to go in to politics tend to go toward the right? I'm just so curious about that. I mean, there was Lynn Swann who was interested in making gubernatorial play. There was, of course, in the Congress the - you know - why is that?  DADE: I don't think that's necessarily the case. I think what is more the case is that high-profile athletes are often recruited by the Republican party. And we're talking, not just Lynn Swann or Steve Largent, other people like that.  ZIRIN: J.C. Watts.  MARTIN: J.C. Watts, who I was thinking of.  ZIRIN: Heath Shuler.  DADE: I think that Republicans have always been better at marketing, always been better at market testing, and they get people whose athletic careers have interracial crossover appeal and they bring them over. But I don't think this is Shaquille O'Neal sort of standing up and saying I'm Republican. I think that's a clear distinction.  MARTIN: That'll be interesting. OK. We just have a couple minutes left, so I just wanted to ask you about a quick thing. A woman in North Dakota reportedly decided to take a stand against childhood obesity on Halloween. The story goes that if overweight kids came to her house they got a letter to give to their parents asking them to step-up and ration their kids' unhealthy eating habits. No word yet if her house was egged last night. Now, I'm sorry, this smells like - like, I don't know if there are any eggs left in North Dakota. But there are rumors that this was a radio station hoax, which this easily could have been. But I did want to ask - I mean, for those - I mean, I know, Dave, you were out trick-or-treating with the people.  ZIRIN: Oh, yes.  MARTIN: If somebody handed you a letter like that and put that in your kid's plastic pumpkin - I don't know. What do you think?  ZIRIN: Oh, we're in the car. We're going to CVS. We're getting the bulk toilet paper, and I am teaching my 5-year-old how to wrap it around a tree to a profound respect, yes.  MARTIN: What about Neil. Neil, what about you? You're trained as a doctor and I know you see these issues, too, as a consultant. What do you think about that?  MINKOFF: So, you know, the question is, how is this really different on a personal - I get that it's personal and I get it's going to an individual kid - but our schools up here will send you a letter if your kid is overweight. And the Massachusetts legislature considered banning bake sales because the kids had too much access to cupcakes. And childhood obesity is in the Zeitgeist. I mean, if you're in favor of the soda ban in New York, then this woman's just taking it to the next level.  MARTIN: OK. Corey, what about you?  DADE: You know, I'm all for kids getting a trick instead of a treat, but this isn't the kind of trick any child wants. Newsflash, if a child is obese, that child knows it.  ZIRIN: Yeah.  MARTIN: That child's parents know it. This kind of missive doesn't - it's not constructive for that child, especially when you're getting it from a stranger and they're vulnerable. They're out trick-or-treating with their friends. They immediately get ostracized right on the point - right at that point.  MARTIN: Yeah, just go with the dental floss. Just be done with it and throw the dental floss in there. Jimi?  DADE: Yeah. I mean, there are better ways to address this.  MARTIN: Jimi, what about you?  IZRAEL: Well, this is personal to me 'cause I have a daughter - a 14-year-old daughter who's kind of, you know, pleasingly plump as my wife might say - a little juicy - and I swear to you, if anybody had given me this note with my daughter out, they would've gotten the pumpkin of wrath...  ZIRIN: Yes.  IZRAEL: ...Right through - right through their living room window. I don't play that.  MARTIN: Well, we're not endorsing any criminal acts. I just want to completely say. Well, point taken. OK.  ZIRIN: No one likes this.  MARTIN: Nobody likes this. Jimi Izrael is a writer and adjunct professor of film and social media at Cuyahoga Community College.
