<div><article><p><span class="dateline"></span> Rep. Mike Michaud (D-Maine), who is running for governor of Maine in 2014, announced Monday that he is gay.</p>
<p>In an op-ed article published in two Maine newspapers, Michaud said decided to come out publicly after his opponents launched a &#x201C;whisper campaign&#x201D; about his sexuality.</p></article><article><p>&#x201C;They want people to question whether I am gay,&#x201D; Michaud wrote in the article, published by the Bangor Daily News and Portland Press Herald. &#x201C;Allow me to save them the trouble with a simple, honest answer: &#x2018;Yes, I am. But why should it matter?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p>Michaud faces Gov. Paul Le&#xAD;Page (R) and independent candidate Eliot Cutler in the governor&#x2019;s race. LePage is considered among the most vulnerable governors in the country.</p><p>Michaud becomes the seventh openly gay member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the eighth in either chamber of Congress. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) became the first openly gay senator after she won her seat last year.</p><p>If elected, Michaud would be the first openly gay person to win a governor&#x2019;s race. Jim McGreevey (D) of New Jersey became the first openly gay governor in 2004, but he didn&#x2019;t come out until he was in office.</p><p>Michaud wrote in the article that he doesn&#x2019;t consider his sexual orientation to be a big deal but added that he decided to make it public in order to show that he&#x2019;s not ashamed.</p><p>&#x201C;And if seeing someone from my background, in my position, openly acknowledge the fact that he&#x2019;s gay makes it a little bit easier for future generations to live their lives openly and without fear, all the better,&#x201D; he wrote.</p><p>Michaud, 58, worked at a paper company for decades before being elected to Congress in 2003. A moderate Democrat, he represents the state&#x2019;s more rural district, which stretches up into the northeastern corner of the United States.</p><p>He previously served in the state Senate.</p></article></div>
